# Fox News Highlights - April 17th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. This is the Ingram Angle. Thank you, as always, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=0.0s)]
*  for spending some time with us. Trump's first three months. That's the focus of tonight's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=5.64s)]
*  angle. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=11.36s)]
*  As Democrats struggle to stand for anything uplifting or hopeful, I thought today, Holy [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=14.64s)]
*  Thursday, was a good time for a quick perspective check on what Donald Trump and his team have [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=19.84s)]
*  accomplished in three short months in office. Now, even as his agenda is hit relentlessly [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=25.52s)]
*  by lawfare, President Trump has already undone many of Biden's most destructive actions, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=31.32s)]
*  and he's begun common sense changes in our fiscal affairs and our foreign policy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=37.88s)]
*  Of course, he's got to overcome not just the media and usual political opposition, but [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  the global elites who've made billions off the 20-year beatdown of the American middle [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  class. But the progress thus far is impressive. First, the border. Now, this is President [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=52.48s)]
*  Trump's most important accomplishment. Crossings are down from Biden's obscene high of 9,741 [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=59.16s)]
*  a day back in December of 2023. Remember those caravans? To now Trump's 355 a day just last [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=66.88s)]
*  month. That's stunning. But wait a second. Wait, wait. I thought a border crackdown wasn't [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=75.8s)]
*  possible. We now need Congress to do their part and act. Our immigration system is outdated [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=80.68s)]
*  and broken and has been in need of reform for literally decades. No, Alejandro, you're [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  outdated. Now, to use Biden's favorite word, all of what he said was malarkey. They broke [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  it. Trump fixed it. As of a few days ago, there were 47,928 illegals in detention. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=102.64s)]
*  But as far as the mass deportations that Donald Trump promised, well, they've got a long, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=110.92s)]
*  long way to go. ICE deported only about 11,000 migrants back in February and just over 12,300 [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=115.6s)]
*  in March. That's not nothing. But again, he got millions here. But now they're urging [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=122.56s)]
*  migrants to self-deport, and Trump's willing to pay them to leave. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  We're going to give them a stipend. We're going to give them some money and a plane [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=132.08s)]
*  ticket. And then we're going to work with them. If they're good, if we want them back [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=136.24s)]
*  in, we're going to work with them to get them back in as quickly as we can. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=140.08s)]
*  I don't need them back in. While Trump's deporting more criminal aliens and gangbangers than [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=144.32s)]
*  Biden ever did, Democrats, they're fighting to keep them here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=148.6s)]
*  Our goal was very simple today, which was to check on the health and well-being of Gilmour. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=153.48s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa. When is the last time Chris Van Hollen, who wants to be your next president, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=164.16s)]
*  by the way, when's the last time he checked on the Moran family's well-being? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  It's totally insane, especially when you consider that the public is giving Trump very positive [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=175.28s)]
*  marks on the immigration issue. Deport all undocumented immigrants, voters favoring the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=180.32s)]
*  government trying to deport all 11 million of them. Back in 2016, just 38 percent of voters [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=186.48s)]
*  wanted the government to try to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants. Compared to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=193.12s)]
*  where we are in 2025, 56 percent, the majority, the American people have come a long way on this issue, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=198.32s)]
*  much closer to Donald Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=205.76s)]
*  And number two in the success is exposing and cutting government waste. This is a big one. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  Of course, with the help of Doge and an all of government approach, President Trump has exposed [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=214.64s)]
*  the holy grail, which is bureaucratic waste, fraud and abuse. Now, while spending in these [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=219.76s)]
*  agencies is often done in secret, the cost savings now, thanks to Elon Musk, is transparent. Now, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=226.64s)]
*  from the Doge website, you can track it. And so far, one hundred and fifty five billion dollars [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=234.4s)]
*  saved or nine hundred and sixty two bucks per taxpayer. Not bad at all. Now, just this week [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  alone, billions were saved at Treasury with zero disruption to any IRS ops. And over at state, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=245.44s)]
*  they've canceled one hundred and thirty nine wasteful grants worth two hundred and fifteen [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=252.16s)]
*  million dollars. Rubio is right when he tweeted that the American taxpayers should not be funding [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=256.48s)]
*  misguided programs like building the migrant domestic worker led movement in Lebanon or [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=262.08s)]
*  get the trolls out in the United Kingdom. That's a disinformation, anti disinformation campaign. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=270.08s)]
*  These are total scams and they're all giveaways to the left. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=275.12s)]
*  And what about what Trump's done for women's sports and privacy? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=280.24s)]
*  Well, this was one of my favorite moments of Trump two point. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=284.32s)]
*  Now. What's what I do. Then I'm going to give you some. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=287.44s)]
*  Are you ready? What a nice picture this is. Governor, you're ready. We'll do a good job. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=292.56s)]
*  Wait, let me press that. I want to make this a really good signature. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=298.16s)]
*  His executive order banning biological men from girls and women's sports. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=308.56s)]
*  I mean, it's just common sense and his view on the matter is overwhelmingly popular. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=313.04s)]
*  But since Democrats suffer from trans mania, they're rushing the court to challenge Trump's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=319.12s)]
*  order. It's another stupid political move by them. Of course, also Trump promised to rebalance [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  our trade relationships and revive American manufacturing. Now, this is the third success and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=331.92s)]
*  it is a success, although it's early. It's among the trickiest, toughest items on his agenda. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=337.76s)]
*  And he faces not just court challenges, but howls from Wall Street and warnings from the Fed chair. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=343.04s)]
*  More on him later. But the White House has gotten little credit for cooling inflation because the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  same experts who blew off concerns about real inflation during Biden's spend to Palooza's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=356.56s)]
*  are now predicting doom. You know what I say to that? Consider the source. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  So the White House needs to substantively refute these doomsdayers. It's obvious that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=368.48s)]
*  they're trying to hurt Trump and derail the tariffs by spooking the markets. There's zero [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=373.76000000000005s)]
*  consideration. Zero is being given to the billions being invested here now because of Trump from [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  foreign sources and other manufacturing. Manufacturing that's obviously going to [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=384.88s)]
*  boost our GDP. Today, Donald Trump met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Maloney and both [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=389.12s)]
*  were upbeat. I'm here exactly to work for the West stronger for. I believe in the West unity [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=395.76s)]
*  and I think simply we have to talk and find ourselves in the in the best middle way to [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=404.32s)]
*  grow together. That's where that's why I'm here. Who doesn't love her? They're going to be talking [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=412.24s)]
*  to the Japanese next week. Now, the president knows America's leverage, our market is huge. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=417.76s)]
*  It's the biggest and he intends to use our leverage and he's optimistic about future [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=423.76s)]
*  deals, including one with China. They want to make one very, very much and we're going to make [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  a trade deal. I fully expect it, but it'll be a fair deal. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=438.56s)]
*  Well, isn't this what we want from an American president? Someone actually interested in getting [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=444.0s)]
*  the best deal for American workers, American businesses, forcing other countries to play fair [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=450.72s)]
*  with our exports and protecting, of course, our essential industries. This is just common sense. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=456.8s)]
*  No American president should have ever allowed us to become dependent on hostile countries for [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=463.76000000000005s)]
*  critical resources. It is literally not so. Trump's the only one willing to take on the global chorus [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=468.72s)]
*  of the critics and to put his entire political legacy on the line. Now, now the rollout maybe [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=475.52s)]
*  could have been handled a little bit more smoothly. Okay. Are certain administration spokesmen on this [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=482.4s)]
*  matter better than others? Yes. Scott Besson is the clearest, most convincing voice on president [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=487.68s)]
*  Trump's team. But look, none of this is easy. But on every front, Trump is moving as fast as he can. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=493.84s)]
*  He's getting hostages released. He's boxing China out of the Panama Canal and opening the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=501.6s)]
*  conversation on Greenland. Still, they're only three months in and the war in Ukraine has not [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=507.44s)]
*  ended. Hamas is still holding some hostages and the Iran nuclear threat still looms. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=513.6s)]
*  But compare all of this to the damage Biden was doing to America during his first three months. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=520.08s)]
*  He reinstated COVID travel restrictions, ended Trump's immigration enforcement and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=527.6s)]
*  expanded refugee programs. He ordered the Census Bureau to count illegals. Oh, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=533.52s)]
*  and he established a White House gender policy council. Of course, I could go on and on. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=538.64s)]
*  But now it's up to Republicans in Congress. Senator Thune, Speaker Johnson. I mean, guys, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=545.36s)]
*  you can take some fewer breaks, right? That would help demand members stay in session, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=552.48s)]
*  enact real spending cuts, not with fake budget tricks, a middle class tax cut, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=557.36s)]
*  support. Don't thwart the president's efforts to rebalance trade. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  Trump's doing his part and then some. It's time to do yours. Three months in. We'll check back in [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  six months. And that's the angle. Democrats' phones are ringing off the hook. They're all [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=575.28s)]
*  asking each other. Have you seen him? Are you going? If you are, when Democrats all want to [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=579.6s)]
*  meet Kilmar Garcia, a verified member of MS 13 who broke into our country and then beat up his wife. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=585.76s)]
*  And the beatings on video, she claims. One Democrat tells Axios we got 24 seven calls on [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  it this week more than any other topic. That means Democrats aren't calling senators about [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=598.96s)]
*  tariffs, signal gate or egg prices. All they want to do is empty a mega prison into Maryland. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=603.84s)]
*  Senator Van Hollens getting a little lonely in El Salvador. He's the only one who's ever [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=609.68s)]
*  tried to break into a prison. Today's purpose was just to see what his health condition is. And these [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=614.56s)]
*  soldiers were ordered to prevent us from going any farther from this spot. I understand we're about [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=622.3199999999999s)]
*  three kilometers now from CICOT. And as you can see, they're letting other cars go by, but they [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  stopped us because they're under orders not to allow us to proceed. An MS 13 terrorist, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=636.64s)]
*  whose wife says he punches her in the face and our politicians fly 3000 miles to check on his health. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  Who cares? Has Van Hollen ever cared this much about an American? Has he ever gone this far [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=649.04s)]
*  for anyone? Ladies, get a guy who cares about you the way Van Hollen cares about MS 13. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=655.04s)]
*  Van Hollen wouldn't even stand up for black kids with cancer. He walked out of Trump's state of the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=662.24s)]
*  union. Van Hollen voted against the Lake and Riley act. And now the esteemed senator from Maryland is [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=667.52s)]
*  demanding a caravan of Democrats descend into El Salvador and break an illegal out of prison [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=673.8399999999999s)]
*  like he's Nelson Mandela. I may be the first member of Congress here, the first senator, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  but I can assure you more will be coming. And you cannot continue to keep this man locked up [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=685.36s)]
*  in this worst prison in El Salvador and one of the worst in the hemisphere. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=693.36s)]
*  Spartacus is booking a first class flight and Tampon says if you don't fight for MS 13 rights, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=698.6400000000001s)]

*  if you're not speaking up for this man, there will be no one left to speak up for you. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=712.8s)]
*  Tampon wants Trump behind bars and MS 13 walking free. MSNBC thinks Garcia is a political prisoner [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=717.76s)]
*  and wants Democrats outside the mega prison around the clock. The Democrats should have [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=725.52s)]
*  someone on the ground in El Salvador every day until Kilmar Abreu Garcia is sent home. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=730.8s)]
*  They need to start thinking about doing things that are more disruptive, things that are more [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=739.92s)]
*  that are different. And I think that that kind of creativity is necessary in a moment like this, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=744.64s)]
*  where the old tactics and the old strategies that have not served the party particularly well [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=750.48s)]
*  recently, they need to be abandoned in favor of something new and more disruptive and more [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=756.16s)]
*  guerrilla style than what we're used to. Martha Stewart's got to be like, I was in prison, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=761.04s)]
*  no one visited me and I'm an American. Minnie Madoff bought the midterms for the Democrats. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=766.48s)]
*  He went to jail, let a single Democrat checked in on his health condition. He didn't even get a [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=773.44s)]
*  conjugal visit. Democrats just stepped in the biggest booby trap since the Jussie Smollett hoax. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=778.8000000000001s)]
*  One Democrat screaming Trump is setting a trap for us. Maybe that doesn't matter in a Democrat [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=785.76s)]
*  plus 30 district, but you're not going to see any frontliners down in El Salvador. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=790.72s)]
*  The president of El Salvador should open the prison and let Democrats visit. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=795.92s)]
*  Let them take photos with Garcia. It'll be in every Republican attack ad next year. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=800.48s)]
*  Maryland residents have seen enough. They're telling Democrats abort the mission. One Maryland [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=806.16s)]
*  congressman says, I'll be candid. I've got people in my district who would be okay with sending these [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=811.92s)]
*  guys out. MSNBC says these gang members should sue Trump for slander. Many of these people are [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=817.92s)]
*  being defamed by Trump TV, defamed by the president, defamed by Pam Bondi, defamed and being labeled [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=825.92s)]
*  things that they may not be. And in the case of a Braco Garcia, they're taking a baseball hat, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=835.8399999999999s)]
*  a baseball hat and saying he's a terrorist because he's wearing a baseball hat. Who's crazy? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=842.96s)]
*  Trump can't call an illegal alien gang member MS-13, but me can call Trump a Nazi? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=852.64s)]
*  Okay. Nazi Young Sheldon Whitehouse says we should pay MS-13 damages. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=858.72s)]
*  The judge says this was outrageous, which you've done violated an existing court order. It lied to [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=866.24s)]
*  me. You've dissembled to the court. You violated your oaths as lawyers and you put this person in [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=871.76s)]
*  terribly grave peril. So I'm going to put the government under a civil contempt sanction of [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  a million dollars a day until he comes back. So there you go. Add up the millions. Oh, and by the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=884.08s)]
*  way, I'll consider awarding some of that to the victim if this isn't solved. Every illegal heard [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=892.64s)]
*  that and said, can you please wrongfully deport me too? Garcia fits right in down there. Have you [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=898.16s)]
*  seen his tats? I talked to an MS-13 expert today who also showed me pictures of his hand, but he [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=905.92s)]
*  says absolutely the tattoo on one of his hands was absolutely an MS-13 gang tattoo. Nothing, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=913.76s)]
*  nothing questionable about it. Two judges said he's an MS-13 member. ICE says he's an MS-13 member. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=918.7199999999999s)]
*  Intelligence community says he's an MS-13 member. El Salvador says he's an MS-13 member. Garcia was [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=925.04s)]
*  arrested in a gang sweep in connection to a murder investigation in a frequent gang area with three [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=931.52s)]
*  active members of MS-13. Informants told police Garcia was an active member of MS-13 with the [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=937.92s)]
*  Western's clique. And when they scooped him up this year, they showed him photos of him on camera [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=944.9599999999999s)]
*  with other members of MS-13. You don't think police did surveillance before they picked him up? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=951.44s)]
*  Wait until those pictures come out. Police say there's no doubt. You've looked at the evidence. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=957.5200000000001s)]
*  Are you convinced as the White House says he's an MS-13 member? Oh, a thousand percent. Yes, indeed. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=964.08s)]
*  A thousand percent. A thousand. No doubt. He's a, no doubt. And he's a domestic violence abuser. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=969.7600000000001s)]
*  Kudos on the Trump administration for removing the criminal. Har, Harbaugh and Senator Van Hollen for [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=975.6s)]
*  wanting to bring him back. Not only was he gang tied and interrogated over human and drug smuggling, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=981.2s)]
*  in 2022, Homeland Security said he was a suspect in a human trafficking incident after he was [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=987.0400000000001s)]
*  pulled over with eight other individuals in the vehicle. This is in Tennessee. Garcia told police [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=994.8000000000001s)]
*  he was driving for three days from Texas to Maryland, but there was no luggage in the car. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1001.6s)]
*  He said he was just bringing in people to perform construction work. Texas to Maryland, kind of a [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1008.4s)]
*  long commute to work. Garcia was driving on an expired driver's license in someone else's car. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1014.48s)]
*  Cops asked him, whose car is it? Garcia said, my boss in construction. Police asked the passengers [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1021.36s)]
*  their addresses and they all gave Garcia's address. But Garcia lived in Maryland and they were coming [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1029.44s)]
*  from Texas. When cops asked everybody to write down their names, the officer couldn't read their [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1036.64s)]
*  handwriting because they just scribbled chicken scratch. But cops just let Garcia off with a [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1042.64s)]
*  warning for driving on an expired license, which is weird because he was flagged on a transnational [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1048.96s)]
*  organized crime watch list. Yeah. Democrats favorite political prisoner is on a transnational [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1055.8400000000001s)]
*  organized crime watch list. Why would police let a guy like that who's on a watch list off on a [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1062.32s)]
*  warning when he's obviously caught red handed human trafficking? Unless this came down from an order [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1068.24s)]
*  from above, Tennessee Highway Patrol has some explaining to do and prime time foyered the body [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1074.6399999999999s)]
*  cam. So stay tuned. Legendary Democrat strategist, James Carville, who's lost his marbles, says, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1080.08s)]
*  forget ordinary people. Democrats should go to bat for foreign traffickers. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1086.64s)]
*  People say, well, should we really fight on this turf or should we fight more [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1092.0800000000002s)]
*  ordinary people? And this we should fight out. You can't pivot to an economic history. Wait a minute. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1096.8000000000002s)]
*  This is why we think we are country. There's real wisdom in it. And history has taught us that. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1105.2800000000002s)]
*  And first they came for him. And then we're going to say no right there. We've got to keep fighting [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1114.72s)]
*  this. I think this is worthy of being at the top agenda of things that we're going to fight over. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1119.92s)]
*  It's get this guy back home, get this guy back home. He is home. And even in the small chance he [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1126.08s)]
*  ever gets out of prison and sets foot on U.S. soil, he's being immediately deported. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1132.72s)]
*  If Democrats actually cared about the law like they say they do, they wouldn't make a guy their [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1137.36s)]
*  poster child who broke it repeatedly. Hillary's saying, see, I told you Trump's a dictator. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1141.44s)]
*  Before the election, I warned that there is no safe haven under authoritarianism. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1148.56s)]
*  If they can ship Kilmore Abrego Garcia to a foreign prison accused of no crime with no trial, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1153.3600000000001s)]
*  they can do it to anyone. Pocahontas says, you're next. Why are they doing this? And the answer is, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1159.04s)]
*  they want to have the American people say it's okay to just disappear people. We do not disappear [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1167.84s)]
*  people in the United States because here's the thing. If they can disappear Mr. Abrego Garcia, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1174.3999999999999s)]
*  then they can disappear you. If they can deport an illegal alien, MS-13 human trafficker accused [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1181.4399999999998s)]
*  of beating his wife twice, they can deport you. You're next. That's the slippery slope we've ever [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1187.84s)]
*  seen. The country doesn't care where this guy goes. They just want him gone. 89% of Americans [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1194.8s)]
*  support deporting illegals accused of violent crimes. 89%. That means basically the whole [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1201.52s)]
*  country supports deporting Garcia. Not only does Trump have a bad hombre mandate, he just has an [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1206.48s)]
*  hombre mandate. They don't even have to be bad. Deport all undocumented immigrants, voters favoring [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1212.56s)]
*  the government trying to deport all 11 million of them. Back in 2016, just 38% of voters wanted [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1220.08s)]
*  the government to try to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants. Compared to where we are [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1227.1999999999998s)]
*  in 2025, 56%, the majority, the American people have come a long way on this issue, much closer [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1232.6399999999999s)]
*  to Donald Trump. And I think that's a big part of the reason why Americans are increasingly saying [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1240.08s)]
*  the country is on the right track when it comes to immigration policy and why Donald Trump's net [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1244.3999999999999s)]
*  approval rating on that issue is in the positive. 47 says he's just doing his job. We were inundated [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1248.08s)]
*  by millions of people, many millions of people during the Biden administration. They say 21 million [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1255.36s)]
*  and a big percentage of those are criminals, serious criminals. I'm not saying just criminal [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1261.6s)]
*  because they came into the border illegally. I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1267.28s)]
*  murderers. Many of those people murdered more than one person and they're on the loose. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1272.8s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals, to get them out of our country [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1279.04s)]
*  or to put them away, but to get them out of our country. And I don't see how judges can take that [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1283.52s)]
*  authority away from a president. Trump baited Democrats into committing political suicide, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1289.44s)]
*  standing up for an accused MS-13 domestic abuser. The federal government has designated MS-13 a [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1295.04s)]
*  terrorist organization. So when Democrats fly south to El Salvador to break him out of prison, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1301.28s)]
*  is that aiding and abetting a known terrorist? That's like Democrats flying to Gitmo during [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1306.08s)]
*  the war on terror and trying to spring loose Al Qaeda. There's no way this ends well for them. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1311.36s)]
*  This is a fight they can't win. Remember the ad last election where Kamala said she was going to [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1316.96s)]
*  give taxpayer-funded sex change surgeries to illegals in jail? Kamala is for they, them. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1322.16s)]
*  And Trump is for you. Remember that? Republicans are going to run ads before the midterms of [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1327.68s)]
*  Democrats trying to release MS-13 terrorists back into the country. Do the Democrats comprende? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1332.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, that was a good one. That was a good one. Oh. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1339.92s)]
*  The feeling is one-sided. Happy Thursday, everyone. Well, a funeral homeowner, a funeral homeowner, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1353.8400000000001s)]
*  a funeral homeowner who hid a corpse in a hearse for over a year has finally entered a plea deal. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1365.6000000000001s)]

*  In a recent interview, George Clooney said there's still one prominent Democrat that's mad at him [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1381.44s)]
*  for telling Joe Biden to drop out of the election. He's not saying who it is, but they both pretended [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1386.4s)]
*  to play doctors on TV. Right now, former VP Kamala Harris is the Democrat frontrunner [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1392.0s)]
*  for the 2028 election, followed by Mayor Pete. No, no, no, no. But supporters say a minority woman [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1402.8799999999999s)]
*  and a gay guy may remind voters of Barack Obama's marriage. I don't get that one. I don't get that [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1411.36s)]
*  one. The actor who played the child in The Sixth Sense, Haley Joel Ottman, was arrested in Colorado [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1420.56s)]
*  for public intoxication. Wow, he's changed. I guess his sixth sense is finding Twinkies. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1427.52s)]
*  Yeah, he no longer sees dead people. He just eats them. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1438.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, kind of depressed, aren't you? Speed of Colorado, nearly 700 women attended the Boot [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1443.84s)]
*  Tan Fest, which is an event where hundreds of women ski naked. It truly was the greatest day [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1448.88s)]
*  of my life, said one man. Finally, the colossal squid, the world's largest squid species, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1455.0400000000002s)]
*  has been caught on video for the first time. In response, guests who just made 2,000 gallons [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1466.3200000000002s)]
*  of marinara sauce. Yeah, saw that one coming. All right, let's do a monologue. Boy, not crazy [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1471.6s)]
*  about the jokes tonight, are you? Well, screw you. Last weekend, a self-identified queer scientist [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1480.48s)]
*  was busted for bombing a Tesla dealership and the Republican Party headquarters in Albuquerque. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1487.84s)]
*  So what's a queer scientist? It's like a regular [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1494.96s)]
*  it's like a regular scientist but has sex. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1502.48s)]
*  But did you notice something that's comically sad? Every person who attacks Tesla has been arrested [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1508.8s)]
*  because the cars have cameras. That's why when I walk past one, I make sure to flex my butt. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1514.4s)]
*  True, these idiots have been caught more times on camera than my house guests when they use the [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1519.6s)]
*  bathroom. But you think the Dems, having seen that repeated outcome, might have stopped egging their [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1523.76s)]
*  constituents on a crusade of vandalism and violence? You think maybe they should have considered what [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1530.24s)]
*  happens to people who don't have the expense of lawyers like they do after they follow their advice? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1535.04s)]
*  Each vandalized Tesla dashes another confused man's dream of one day being shot by a car. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1541.52s)]
*  Each confused man's dream of one day moving out of a Newark airport's men's room. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1548.16s)]
*  Now, not one single Dem who called Musk Hitler to galvanize the mob has spoken out on behalf of those [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1553.52s)]
*  arrested. They led these lemmings off the cliff and then pretend they didn't exist. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1560.4s)]
*  They're just useful idiots like the children that work in my handbag factory. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1565.0400000000002s)]
*  It's the tiny hands that make this stitching. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1568.88s)]
*  It's a reoccurring trap. The Dems create a fiction, say it's true even though they know it's not. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1576.24s)]
*  They let the mob do their job, then they cut them loose like their name was Chris Wallace. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1581.2800000000002s)]
*  The latest fiction? The Maryland Dad. But the Dems even suckered themselves on this. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1588.4s)]
*  Do you think Van Holland would have flown to El Salvador had he known he was rescuing an abuser [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1595.84s)]
*  with a history of violence? Well maybe. I mean he did vote against the Lake and Riley Act. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1601.04s)]
*  But now he flew thousands of miles to save a dirt bag. If their security did a cavity search, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1608.0s)]
*  they'd find his head. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1613.6s)]
*  Thank you. Good butt joke. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1618.7199999999998s)]
*  But my guess is he figured this virtue signal would put him on the media's map so he booked a flight. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1620.8s)]
*  Midair the news breaks and suddenly he's in a trap of his party's making. Can't you just see him [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1630.1599999999999s)]
*  after he saw the news on his phone bawling his eyes out and banging on the cockpit door, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1635.6s)]
*  please you got to turn this thing around. I left my wallet in the s*** at Dulles. Or Dulles. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1640.32s)]
*  Dulles. Dulles. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1645.84s)]
*  So just like a dumb s*** keying a car, he looks like a fool. What's next for him? Well what's next [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1651.6s)]
*  for those students caught on video tearing down hostage posters, screaming on behalf of Hamas, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1657.9199999999998s)]
*  good luck getting a job, besides a prime time slot on MSNBC? Or what of the activists arrested [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1662.9599999999998s)]
*  for blocking traffic or trashing art museums? Their future is as bright as Stevie Wonder's career [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1668.72s)]
*  as an NHL goalie. No, it's because he's black. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1674.24s)]
*  Now see I didn't see that coming. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1685.1200000000001s)]
*  So once these misguided dopes are led to this place, who leads them out? No one. They were used. A [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1691.6s)]
*  means to an end, like when I dated a Kardashian. And how many libs were told Trump was Hitler, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1698.24s)]
*  Musk imitated a Nazi, or that Doge was stealing their benefits, and then sent death threats that [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1704.96s)]
*  got him picked up? The list goes on. But all of these narratives they use have one thing in common. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1710.24s)]
*  Each one is the new thing, not the real thing. It's the novelty of a new lie to replace the debunked [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1715.92s)]
*  old one. After their previous hoax gets fact-checked, they move to the next one, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1722.0800000000002s)]
*  because before you can figure out that you were bamboozled in the first place. It's how we ended [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1726.64s)]
*  up getting something like queers for Palestine, which is as absurd as boners for Rosie O'Donnell. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1731.92s)]
*  Rather than focusing on real solutions to real problems, the left creates lies to sway public [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1744.4s)]
*  opinion. And some indeed get swayed. Enough to shoot a president, trash your car, defend violent [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1749.6000000000001s)]
*  gang members from other countries. The Dems act as the marionette, riling constituents into a frenzy [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1755.04s)]
*  against the evil they were told existed. They've set these traps for years, entangling the vulnerable [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1761.2s)]
*  into a web of deceit. But their reign of lies will come to an end once voters realize they're being [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1767.12s)]
*  led down the path towards their own self-destruction, fighting a mirage that wasn't there. And left among [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1771.92s)]
*  the rubble, a fool like Van Hollen, trying to book a flight back from El Salvador with nothing in his [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1778.56s)]
*  hand but his own dick. And a tiny bag of peanuts. Let's welcome tonight's guest. You can catch him [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1784.4s)]
*  at Box and Friends in the morning and my place later, co-host of Box and Friends weekend Charlie [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1797.52s)]
*  Eart. His brain is so powerful, look what it did to his hair. Author and the host of the James [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1802.48s)]
*  Altafcher Show, James Altafcher. She likes to read eye charts at the beach. Host of the Kennedy [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1809.84s)]
*  Saves the World podcast, Kennedy. And like a dish of butterscotch candy, old ladies prefer him hard. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1817.6s)]
*  New York Times best-selling author, comedian, former Deputy Bureau Attorney, Tyrus. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1827.84s)]
*  Charlie, how do you think Van Hollen is feeling right now? Going to El Salvador, thinking he's [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1831.68s)]
*  rescuing the most vulnerable of people. It turns out the guy's a scale, you know? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1842.0800000000002s)]
*  I think it's a totally open question. I don't know that he would have done it differently because, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1847.04s)]
*  you know, we're so far down the tracks from, you know, beyond where Democrats actually stood for [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1851.52s)]
*  anything. They're just trying to perform for the craziest people in their party and so they don't, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1858.24s)]
*  they think that this is perfectly fine. From Trump's standpoint, this is like the greatest [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1865.68s)]
*  political jiu-jitsu there is. If you can get your opponents to defend the literally indefensible, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1871.0400000000002s)]
*  then you win. And that's what he's managed to do here. And, you know, the whole thing began [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1878.0s)]
*  with the Dreamers. The Dreamers were children of illegals who came here, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1883.04s)]
*  were brought here, you know, without their knowledge as children. And now we've gone from [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1887.76s)]
*  Dreamers, people that everybody sort of empathized with, all the way to literally a gangbanger. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1894.72s)]
*  People do that a lot. They get banger or member. They never know which way to go. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1902.72s)]
*  Part of it, you should get the member. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1907.44s)]
*  And then it turns out he's also a wife beater. Yes. And that's who the Democrats, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1911.28s)]
*  these are the new Dreamers. Yes, it keeps, they keep moving the goalpost. James, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1916.24s)]
*  welcome back to the show. It's been a long time. Thanks for having me back. Yeah. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1920.1599999999999s)]
*  Charlie kind of hits at this, that like, because they think Trump is so evil, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1926.3999999999999s)]
*  they're willing to side with just about any crazy idea. I mean, imagine if Trump's announced [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1930.48s)]
*  hey, look, we've got this cure for cancer. I even have this cure for cancer. You know, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1936.48s)]
*  they're just going to start firebombing cancer clinics. Like, no, they're not holding back. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1941.84s)]
*  But I think we're almost too hard on this Senator. I think he legitimately, as a little boy, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1946.16s)]
*  he dreamt one day he was going to go to El Salvador and try to take a legal citizen there, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1951.52s)]
*  sneak him into the U.S. to beat up his wife and kill people, join gangs. Gangs are just [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1958.56s)]
*  friendly clubs, right? They are. So look, I think a lot of these people think they're doing the [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1964.64s)]
*  right thing, you know, bombing Teslas, rescuing gang members. And it's just that's the delusion. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1969.68s)]
*  They've been, there's two types of Democrats right now. There's the elites that are figuring out [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1975.8400000000001s)]
*  what everybody should say. And that's all the people that are then saying and repeating this [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1980.48s)]
*  nonsense while the actual work's getting done because they don't have anything to stand on. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1985.1200000000001s)]
*  There's no actual work that they're doing. What does a Senator do right now? What does a [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1989.3600000000001s)]
*  Congressman do right now? They just have to go on these shows and, oh, I'm going to go to El Salvador [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1992.64s)]
*  and take all their citizens and bring them here to blow up Tesla dealerships and cancer hospitals. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=1997.92s)]
*  So it doesn't make any sense. That's the next step. I never liked those cancer hospitals, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2004.0s)]
*  Kennedy. I kid. I'm a very proud supporter of cancer hospitals and Kennedy. Thank you, Greg. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2009.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't want to get any hateful letters. From the pro-Kennedy anti-cancer people. Exactly. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2016.16s)]
*  There's more of them than Elon Musk's babies. Yes, that is true. Shouldn't the left somehow be [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2023.5200000000002s)]
*  waking up to these absurd crusades that never turn out to be true? No, and there's a way of doing it. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2029.76s)]
*  There's a way of going at which they should have done with George Floyd. They should have gone, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2034.64s)]
*  this guy was a dirt bag, you know, Kilmar, Abrego Garcia is a horrible person. You know, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2038.72s)]
*  we don't condone what he does, but this is not how things should work in the United States. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2044.3200000000002s)]
*  There's a way of doing that, but they can't because they fall into the state of the union trap, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2047.6000000000001s)]
*  which President Trump realized worked so well, even though it wasn't technically a state of the [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2051.76s)]
*  union speech, but the joint session of Congress where he's like, you know, and here's this [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2056.5600000000004s)]
*  grieving mother whose daughter was killed and, you know, she bravely had a hippopotamus name for her [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2061.0400000000004s)]
*  daughter because she loved animals, you know, and everyone else is standing up and wiping tears [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2067.6800000000003s)]
*  in their eyes and Democrats like, no, it's stupid. Yeah. Like we don't even feel bad for her. Yeah. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2071.2000000000003s)]
*  And that's what they're so he's figured out a way to do that with essentially every issue [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2076.1600000000003s)]
*  and force Democrats to back themselves into a corner. And I look at the Senator and I'm like, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2080.56s)]
*  where were you when you heard there were 250,000 kids who came into this country illegally with [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2085.76s)]
*  coyotes and were either human trafficked or completely lost? Yes. Like where are your flights [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2093.2s)]
*  for them? Why aren't you combing the desert? By the way, did we pay for this? I'm sure we do. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2099.2s)]
*  Yeah, I can't believe I don't think Van Hollen paid for this out of his own pocket. Well, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2105.92s)]
*  he's compromised now. Yeah. And I think he was compromised before. I still look at this whole [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWwsMFF9TPk&t=2112.88s)]
