# Fox News Highlights - May 19th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8)
*  We got some sad news over the weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Joe Biden revealed he was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  that spread to his bones. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=9.08s)]
*  Stage four. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=10.88s)]
*  President Biden said, cancer touches all of us. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=12.36s)]
*  Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=15.36s)]
*  Thank you for lifting us up with love and support. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=20.64s)]
*  President Trump wished Biden a fast and successful recovery. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  We hear hope President Biden's getting proper care and keeps fighting. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=28.08s)]
*  This was a shocking diagnosis. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=31.88s)]
*  How did the best medical team in the country let the world's most powerful man's cancer [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=33.66s)]
*  go undetected until now? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=38.08s)]
*  Biden was the one who caught it himself. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=41.72s)]
*  He had urinary issues, went to the doctor, and they found a nodule. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=44.14s)]
*  That's not how prostate cancer is detected these days. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Doctors usually find it way earlier through blood tests. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=52.2s)]
*  And Biden wasn't given a cancer screening at his last medical checkup about a year [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=55.76s)]
*  ago. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  It is interesting to note that President Trump's, President Obama's, and President Bush the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  second, in their most recent physicals, in their terms of office, obviously 2025, President [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump did comment on their PSA levels. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=73.52s)]
*  And so they got screened while in office and they commented on it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=77.68s)]
*  There is not a report of a PSA test on the most recent physical that was read out for [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=81.24s)]
*  President Biden's last year in office. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=86.08s)]
*  Which doctor decided not to screen President Biden for prostate cancer and why? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=88.0s)]
*  Biden's not a healthy man. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=93.52s)]
*  He had skin cancer when he was president. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=95.16s)]
*  He broke his foot, had two pretty bad cases of COVID. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  And before he was president, he had two brain aneurysms. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=101.8s)]
*  Why aren't they doing a full battery of tests on America's oldest president? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=105.44s)]
*  Yale doctor Howard Foreman says it's inconceivable that this wasn't caught earlier. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=110.28s)]
*  Dr. Zeke Emanuel, a Biden guy, says Biden's had prostate cancer for years. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  If you have prostate cancer that has spread to the bone, then he's most certainly, you [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  are saying had it when he was president of the United States. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=129.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=132.92s)]
*  He did not develop it in the last 100, 200 days. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=133.92s)]
*  He had it while he was president. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=138.96s)]
*  He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=140.52s)]
*  Yes, I don't think there's any disagreement about that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  Other doctors think the cancer could have been spreading for a decade. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  The fact that we just find it at a Gleason 9 is just pretty much unheard of in this day [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=156.56s)]
*  and age of medicine. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=162.72s)]
*  Most likely he had prostate cancer for a long time. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=164.12s)]
*  I mean, usually it takes from the first diagnosis of prostate cancer to spread would take five [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=167.64s)]
*  to ten years, even in the most aggressive form. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=175.83999999999997s)]
*  Biden's son died of brain cancer. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=180.27999999999997s)]
*  Seems like the big guy was high risk. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=182.48s)]
*  Why not run a test? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=184.56s)]
*  We know they never ran a cognitive test, and now they don't run a test for cancer. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=186.56s)]
*  Biden had more COVID tests than cancer tests. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  Gutfeld speculated Biden's people may have been motivated by power. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=195.2s)]
*  Joe's dysfunction may have been caused not by disability, but by debility, meaning he was worn down on purpose, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=201.0s)]
*  deliberately kept feeble and weak, which made him pliable like a POW, except the W stands for White House. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=210.16s)]
*  Joe's dysfunction was not prevented when it could have been because it kept him easily managed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=218.08s)]
*  It's fair to speculate that Biden's doctors aren't telling the truth. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=225.88000000000002s)]
*  It could have been medical malpractice. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=229.84s)]
*  It could have been a fluke or it could have been a medical cover up. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  We have every right to ask questions because of the White House history of lying. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=235.68s)]
*  Is it possible that they were withholding his PSA levels or some symptoms that he was having? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=241.52s)]
*  It's possible. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  But I can tell you that he has an aggressive, fast acting form of prostate cancer. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=247.6s)]
*  It could have formed in the last six months. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  It could have started forming six years ago. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  Other doctors are speculating Biden may have had cancer this whole time and was receiving cancer treatment and not disclosing it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=258.24s)]
*  Do you feel like that's an accurate or a reasonable analysis of the situation that he's known for quite some time and he was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=266.88s)]
*  There is a high, high probability, a high probability. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=276.0s)]
*  The fact that they're now looking at terminal disease, this is terminal. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  He's going to he's going to be gone in two or three years. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=281.52s)]
*  Although, to be fair, prostate cancer research is moving so fast, they might come up with something that could extend it out five or seven years where he might die of something else first. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=283.88s)]
*  But he has a terminal condition. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=292.08s)]
*  At presentation, somebody who's getting regular medical management, it doesn't present as metastatic disease. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=293.56s)]
*  It's just not how it works. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  So somebody is known for quite a while. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  A doctor on CNN is suggesting that alleged secret cancer treatments could explain Biden's cognitive decline. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=302.8s)]
*  One of the biggest side effects that I see in my patients that get these hormone treatments could be cognitive changes. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=311.88s)]
*  So you have to kind of balance that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=319.2s)]
*  People can also get issues with fatigue and weight loss. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=321.96s)]
*  But when he has stuff in his bones, he's also at higher risk for fractures. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=326.36s)]
*  So it is it is a very sensitive conversation. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=329.56s)]
*  Dr. Segal says it's highly unlikely Biden didn't already know he had cancer and it's time to come clean. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=334.08s)]
*  I think they should be public exactly when this was diagnosed. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=340.4s)]
*  Brian, we were talking last week about when were the cognitive issues diagnosed? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=344.04s)]
*  I want to know when this was found exactly. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=348.12s)]
*  I want to know why. I want to know exactly when this was found. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=350.56s)]
*  Trump's former White House doctor, Ronnie Jackson, who treated Biden when he was V.P., says Biden's doctor was distracted. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  Quote, care at the White House should be second to none. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=361.44s)]
*  Unbelievable this was missed. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=364.8s)]
*  But the truth is his physician was more concerned about assisting with the political cover up than providing world class medical care. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=366.88s)]
*  Dr. Kevin O'Connor has some explaining to do. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  He's not just your average doctor. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=378.12s)]
*  He was involved in the Biden family business. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=380.12s)]
*  Biden brought him in because he trusted him and knew he could keep secrets. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=382.8s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight fired former FBI director Jim Comey. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=394.12s)]
*  He is at it again after posting seashells seemingly calling for Donald Trump to be murdered or eighty six forty seven on Instagram. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=397.92s)]
*  Gee, he never thought what that might mean. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  Anyway, Mr. Higher honored James Comey, the coward that he is, ran to his favorite network, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=410.08000000000004s)]
*  MSDNC, to declare his righteousness, his innocence. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=415.64000000000004s)]
*  And there were no heartfelt apologies, no well wishes for the president who was shot on stage only a few months ago. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=419.72s)]
*  Instead, Comey was full of excuses. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=426.6s)]
*  And he actually tried to make the case that it's not Donald Trump. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=429.12s)]
*  No, he's the victim here. Take a look. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=433.16s)]
*  And we saw in the sand someone had arranged shells with numbers. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=436.56s)]
*  And Patrice, my wife, said, why would someone put an address in the sand? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=440.4s)]
*  And I said, I don't know. And we stood over it and I said, you know, I think it's some kind of political message. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=444.32s)]
*  And she said, you know, eighty six when I was a server, she did a lot of work in restaurants meant to remove an item from the menu when you ran out of ingredients. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=449.56s)]
*  And I said, well, to me, as a kid, it always meant to leave a place, to ditch a place. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=456.79999999999995s)]
*  It's hard to have regret about something that even in hindsight looks to me to be totally innocent. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=461.32s)]
*  Sounds a little too cute by half, doesn't it? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=467.0s)]
*  The head of the FBI, he knows what eighty six means to be eighty six. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=469.15999999999997s)]
*  James Comey, James Comey to me is a liar who from day one has tried to get Donald Trump one way or another. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  He used Hillary's phony, dirty Russian disinformation dossier. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=481.32s)]
*  You might recall to obtain secret FISA warrants against the Trump campaign and spy on that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=485.23999999999995s)]
*  In his transition team and the White House, he personally signed three out of four of them. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=490.76000000000005s)]
*  He perpetuated the Russia hoax even when he knew it was a smear campaign orchestrated by Democrats. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=495.36s)]
*  And according to reports, he was warned in 2016 in August to be specific not to use the political research, which now has totally been debunked. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=502.6s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it was only years later under questioning from Senator Lindsey Graham that he finally admitted that knowing what he knows now, he never would have ever signed the warrants. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=513.8s)]
*  Wow, we knew it then. He knew it then, too. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=525.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=528.24s)]
*  Knowing then what you know now about all the things that we've come to find, would you have still signed the warrant application against Carter Page in October, January and April? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=529.8s)]
*  No, I would want a much more complete understanding of what we were. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=541.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=546.12s)]
*  No, he wouldn't have. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=548.48s)]
*  And by the way, that Carter Page, that was a backdoor to all things Trump world. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=549.88s)]
*  Actually, it's what he knew then. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=554.04s)]
*  That's what matters. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=557.5999999999999s)]
*  Under his repulsive so-called leadership of the FBI, he transformed what was the world's premier law enforcement agency into nothing more than an arm of the Democratic Party and became from day one [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=558.76s)]
*  the leader of the Trump derangement syndrome deep state. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=570.64s)]
*  And now he wants to sell a book, wants to get rich while casually calling for what? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=574.4s)]
*  Putting out an Instagram post, 8647. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=580.16s)]
*  That sounds like somebody wanting the assassination of a sitting U.S. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=583.64s)]
*  president and then act like I have no idea what that means. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=587.24s)]
*  I think it's political in nature. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, let's act dumb. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  It's time for Comey to be held accountable. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=595.08s)]
*  Now we'll have much more on this straight ahead tonight. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=597.4s)]
*  But first, we do begin with terrible news. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=599.48s)]
*  Joe Biden, the former president, has now been diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=602.28s)]
*  Sadly, this has metastasized to his bones. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=608.6s)]
*  Of course, everybody should pray for him, wish him well. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=612.16s)]
*  Cancer is a horrific disease and no one deserves to go through this. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=614.9599999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, Biden's cancer is aggressive with a Gleason score of nine, which is almost unheard of. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=620.4399999999999s)]
*  According to close friends, medical doctors that I know, and according to most physicians, this type of prostate cancer, it takes years to get to this point. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=628.04s)]
*  Even over at MSDNC, one time Biden ally oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel stated with quite confidence that the former president likely had prostate cancer for up to 10 years, including all four years that he was in the White House. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=637.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=652.8s)]
*  Doesn't it take some time for prostate cancer to develop to a point where it would spread to the bones? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=654.24s)]
*  Oh, he's had this for many years, maybe even a decade, growing there and spreading. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=663.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=670.8s)]
*  This is not speculation. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=671.48s)]
*  If you have prostate cancer that is spread to the bone, then he's most certainly you are saying had it when he was president of the United States. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=673.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he did not develop it in the last 100, 200 days. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=683.48s)]
*  He had it while he was president. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=688.76s)]
*  He probably had it at the start of his presidency. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, this is generally a slow moving cancer. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=694.6s)]
*  As a matter of fact, most men will die with some prostate cancer, but they won't die from prostate cancer. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=698.9599999999999s)]
*  Now, it's one of the most detectable cancers that does exist. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=705.28s)]
*  In fact, detection is very simple. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  A standard blood test, they call it a PSA test. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=711.8s)]
*  And for the last four years, the president has enjoyed world class medical care as president with rigorous testing or what they should have that what should have been rigorous testing. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=714.64s)]
*  So the question tonight, what happened? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=726.16s)]
*  Why are we learning about this stage four cancer diagnosis now? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=728.96s)]
*  It is sadly metastasized to his bones. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=733.96s)]
*  That is now put his life in jeopardy. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=736.88s)]
*  Of course, this comes in the shadow of a very real cover up conducted by Joe Biden's family, his staffers, the state run legacy media mob surrounding the former president's obvious cognitive decline. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=739.0s)]
*  Or as Van Jones put it very truthfully, a crime against our republic. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=751.3599999999999s)]
*  Take a look. I was shocked to see his condition when he came out. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=756.52s)]
*  And so was the world. And that wasn't the first time he was in that condition. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=760.8399999999999s)]
*  The book makes it very, very clear. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=764.88s)]
*  There are people who knew and said nothing, and that is a crime against this republic. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=766.84s)]
*  And I think the Democrats are going to pay for a long time for being a part of what is now being revealed to be a massive cover up. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=774.12s)]
*  Now, every week since at least 2019, right here on this program, we sounded the alarm about Joe Biden's mental difficulties and his cognitive decline. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=781.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, at the time we were ridiculed, we were mocked, we were called conspiracy theorists. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=792.32s)]
*  But every night we brought the tape to you, our viewers, very real, not cheap fake videos of Joe Biden struggling to function. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=797.5200000000001s)]
*  They didn't do any of this on fake news, CNN or MSDNC or the three major networks that would include, by the way, The Washington Post, New York Times. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=807.2800000000001s)]
*  They lied to their readers. They lied to their viewers. They did it day after day. They did it night after night. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=817.6s)]
*  And they lapped up whatever garbage the White House was feeding them about Joe Biden's. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=822.64s)]
*  This has to do with the fact that he stutters or, you know, it's hard for us to keep up with him, even though we're only, you know, 30 years old. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=827.6800000000001s)]
*  Now, fake Jake Tapper, he's poised to make a lot of money pretending that he and other journalists were a victim of a White House cover up. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=835.6800000000001s)]
*  Jake, if you have eyes to see and ears to hear, did you really think it was strange that Joe was taking every weekend off while never doing any unscripted pressers, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=844.36s)]
*  getting his questions ahead of time from your fellow journalists? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=856.04s)]
*  Or what about falling again and again and wandering off stage and getting lost and never holding cabinet meetings? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=860.12s)]
*  What about the Her report? The special counsel declined to recommend charges in Biden's classified documents probe, not from a lack of evidence, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=867.36s)]
*  but because they determined that Joe Biden wasn't fit to stand trial or, as Her himself put it, the president was an elderly man with a very poor memory. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=876.6s)]
*  The Biden White House fought tooth and nail to prevent the audio of that interview from being released and for good reason. Take a listen. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=886.68s)]
*  One month ago, dying, May 30, 2015. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=897.36s)]
*  2015, he died. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=904.16s)]
*  I think it's 2015. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=907.28s)]
*  I'm not sure the months are, but I think those are. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=909.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=910.48s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=912.6s)]
*  And what's happened in the meantime is that as Trump gets elected in November of 2017. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=913.6s)]
*  2016. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=929.8000000000001s)]
*  2016. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=930.8000000000001s)]
*  2016. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=931.8000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=932.8000000000001s)]
*  So. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=933.8000000000001s)]
*  2017. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=938.8000000000001s)]
*  That's when he left office. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=940.52s)]
*  January. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=941.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=942.52s)]
*  But that's when Trump gets sworn in. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=943.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=950.52s)]
*  Correct. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=951.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=952.52s)]
*  And in 2017, Bo had passed and. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=953.52s)]
*  This is personal. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=960.52s)]
*  He didn't know the year that his son passed. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=970.24s)]
*  He didn't know the year that Donald Trump was elected. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=973.24s)]
*  Now, my father died in late March of 1997. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=976.24s)]
*  I remember it well. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=981.24s)]
*  The meandering interview was really bad. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=982.24s)]
*  There were points during the interview where Biden didn't make any sense at all. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=985.24s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=988.24s)]
*  You know, I went to Mongolia and. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=989.24s)]
*  Great pictures. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=994.24s)]
*  Unfortunately, I embarrassed the leader of Mongolia. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=995.96s)]
*  They were showing they were doing what they would do at the time of the invasion of the [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=999.96s)]
*  Mongols into Europe in the 14th and the eight hundreds. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1006.96s)]
*  So we're out in the middle of nowhere and they're looking up and they only see this [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1011.96s)]
*  tiny line. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1014.96s)]
*  You know, it's a 20 mile horse race with all these kids under 16 on a bareback racing to [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1015.96s)]
*  come down. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1021.96s)]
*  And there are sumo wrestlers doing everything they do. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1023.6800000000001s)]
*  And so they walked over and they had a target. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1027.68s)]
*  Bail said, hey, hundreds of yards away. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1031.68s)]
*  And these gorillas were, you know, taking shots. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1033.68s)]
*  And I think I don't know if that's going to embarrass me or make a point, but handed [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1037.68s)]
*  the bow and arrow. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1042.68s)]
*  I'm not a bad archer, but only if I found that word, if I could pull it back. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1044.68s)]
*  So I. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1050.4s)]
*  Sure, like I had to. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1052.4s)]
*  I really did. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1055.4s)]
*  Whoever told Biden it was a good idea to run for reelection. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1057.4s)]
*  Why did they lie to all of you? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1061.4s)]
*  You know, was it the woman pictured right there sitting at the head of Biden's last [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1063.4s)]
*  cabinet meeting, Dr. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1069.4s)]
*  Jill Biden? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1070.4s)]
*  Did she not know really? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1071.4s)]
*  Are we to believe that? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1073.4s)]
*  You know, did she not know firsthand about her husband and the cognitive struggle that [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1074.4s)]
*  were clear and obvious to anybody with eyes to see? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1080.1200000000001s)]
*  Now, either she's delusional or she's simply just flat out lied to everyone. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1083.1200000000001s)]
*  And so did his staffers. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1088.1200000000001s)]
*  And so did elected Democrats on the Hill and the state run legacy media mob. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1090.1200000000001s)]
*  This is probably the biggest scandal in American presidential history. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1094.1200000000001s)]
*  Certainly the greatest national security threat in history. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1099.1200000000001s)]
*  And so, like many Americans, I have questions about the timing of all of this. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1103.84s)]
*  And while we're at it, could someone really tell us, you know, who was in charge during [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1109.84s)]
*  Biden's years as president? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1114.84s)]
*  Because it wasn't Joe. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1116.84s)]

*  I hear you were a Brian Kling. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1320.08s)]

*  no members. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1331.32s)]

*  He's just not the comments that were made by that prosecutor. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1353.3600000000001s)]
*  Gratuitous, inaccurate and inappropriate. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1357.3600000000001s)]
*  Many American people have been watching and they have expressed concerns about your age. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1361.3600000000001s)]

*  I'm just saying this guy says such random about his. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1371.3600000000001s)]
*  Oh, stop. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1376.3600000000001s)]
*  He's 81 and his memory, you know, it doesn't seem great. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1378.06s)]
*  It's not horrible. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1381.06s)]
*  Oh, I'm so glad none of these people are doctors, especially this one. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1382.06s)]
*  You never know. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1394.06s)]
*  If anything, her handled Biden with kid gloves because he saw what we saw and what the media [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1395.06s)]
*  tried to hide. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1400.6599999999999s)]

*  Now it's time to bury them and let maggots and worms do their thing. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1405.26s)]
*  But forget the Dems for a moment. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1409.36s)]
*  They have a reason for lying. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1410.76s)]
*  For them, politics is a team sport and lying is the playbook. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1412.76s)]
*  They'll tell you higher prices are a good thing or that Tim Walz is a man's man. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1416.36s)]
*  Or that the only thing missing from girl sports is a penis. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1422.06s)]
*  But the media betrayed their profession and put the country in danger and that can't be [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1426.76s)]
*  forgiven. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1431.06s)]
*  It's clear Biden wasn't running the country. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1432.06s)]
*  Hell, he couldn't have run a dishwasher. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1433.96s)]
*  And they knew that under Biden, we saw awful things occur. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1437.16s)]
*  War, terror, crime, Jesse getting his own show. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1440.96s)]
*  Would none of that have happened if someone was actually president? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1447.46s)]
*  They knew the presidency was a sham and they ridiculed anyone who said otherwise because [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1451.32s)]
*  he had a D next to his name. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1456.3s)]
*  It makes me wonder, is there any industry like the media that orchestrated a similar [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1459.22s)]
*  cover-up, one that hid dangers to the American people and service to wealth and power? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1463.42s)]
*  One comes to mind, the tobacco industry. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1468.32s)]
*  For decades they hid the fact that cigarettes were killing millions until finally they had [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1470.92s)]
*  to put warning labels on their product. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1474.72s)]
*  My favorite is the one that says smoking reduces blood flow, which causes erectile dysfunction. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1477.3600000000001s)]
*  It's so much easier than telling a woman that she's a five. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1484.22s)]
*  Oh, how nice. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1489.22s)]
*  Oh, you guys. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1494.22s)]
*  You guys. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1497.1200000000001s)]
*  But over time smoking decreased. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1498.1200000000001s)]
*  People still do it because it's fun and cool, unlike the media. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1501.78s)]
*  True, the media's lies are a danger to your health. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1505.6200000000001s)]
*  They'll push getting rid of cops and going soft on criminals. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1509.64s)]
*  Then they'll tell you that the crime stats went down. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1512.9s)]
*  But at least smoking offers some relief and you can stomp it out when you're done with [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1516.1s)]
*  it. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1519.98s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1520.98s)]
*  Unlike smoking, you never hear a coworker say, hey, I'm going to go outside and take [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1521.98s)]
*  a Jake Tapper break. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1526.1399999999999s)]

*  No one ever says, can I bum a Lawrence O'Donnell off you? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1535.04s)]
*  The closest you hear is, I ran into Don Lemon panhandling during my smoke break. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1539.36s)]
*  True. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1545.6200000000001s)]

*  Host of the Guy Benson show, Guy Benson. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1667.1399999999999s)]

*  Host of the Getting Safe for the World podcast, Kennedy. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1692.38s)]
*  All right, Guy, a lot of bad news this week, but it feels like they're trying to juxtapose [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1701.22s)]
*  today's bad news as a way to press, to push away the other bad news about the cover up. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1706.62s)]
*  What say you, bearded guy? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1713.1s)]
*  So I saw Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the House, come out today and say [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1716.4199999999998s)]
*  that Republicans are pushing conspiracy theories. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1721.8999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1725.02s)]
*  For suggesting what you just did, which is the her tapes come out. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1725.54s)]
*  They're devastating on Friday. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1728.9399999999998s)]
*  And then by Sunday, that weekend, they put a button on it. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1730.78s)]
*  They put a bookend on it and they announce the cancer. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1735.1799999999998s)]
*  Now I have no idea. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1738.62s)]
*  I'm not making an allegation. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1739.62s)]
*  I don't know what actually happened. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1740.62s)]
*  I don't know when he was diagnosed. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1741.62s)]
*  Maybe it really came down on Saturday. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1742.86s)]
*  But are we really doing the conspiracy theory thing? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1745.4199999999998s)]
*  Are they going to go back to that well again? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1747.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, everything's. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1750.54s)]
*  He's dismissing it as a conspiracy theory. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1751.54s)]
*  It's like, dude, everything we've been saying about this guy and his condition is correct. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1752.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1757.5s)]
*  And the other one that they are saying, and he said it in a lot of the other leftists [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1758.5s)]
*  and the media and the Democratic Party, they're saying, let's look forward. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1761.58s)]
*  Let's move forward. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1765.5s)]
*  Let's stop looking backward. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1767.02s)]
*  No, I'm not over this because of what they perpetrated on us. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1768.02s)]
*  And also, what are we supposed to move forward to? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1772.1399999999999s)]
*  Their next new and exciting lies? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1773.6999999999998s)]
*  This is a really good point and I'm surprised you had it. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1775.8s)]
*  No, the only people, Julie, that say let's move forward are the people who commit crimes. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1779.62s)]
*  I've seen so many on Instagram people getting arrested and they're just like, oh, come on. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1788.74s)]
*  You got the stuff. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1793.18s)]
*  Just let me go. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1794.6s)]
*  When they're shoplifting, they go, you already got this. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1795.94s)]
*  Just let me go. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1798.38s)]
*  No, you have to be, we have to take you to court. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1799.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1802.1s)]
*  No, that happened to me when I was arrested when I was 16. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1803.1s)]
*  I was like, come on, just let it go. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1804.9s)]
*  It was minor shoplifting, not a big deal. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1806.34s)]
*  But no, I mean, this is a boy. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1808.5s)]
*  That wasn't when you were a teenager. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1809.5s)]
*  That was last week, Julie. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1810.56s)]
*  Well I got, they dropped the charges so it doesn't count. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1813.14s)]
*  So this is a boy cried wolf, unfortunately, scenario. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1816.06s)]
*  And so when they accuse Republicans of coming up with conspiracy theories, medical doctors, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1818.74s)]
*  medical experts have said that there's a very good chance that he was diagnosed six months, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1823.6799999999998s)]
*  if not six years ago. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1827.02s)]
*  So that is a very likely medical reason. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1828.58s)]
*  The reason for the lies, however, is just a simple coverup. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1831.1399999999999s)]
*  And I myself am a former liar. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1834.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1835.86s)]
*  So I know a liar when I see one. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1836.86s)]
*  Like when I was 19 and I got pulled over by a cop and he asked me, did you know your license [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1838.3799999999999s)]
*  is suspended? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1842.26s)]
*  I said no. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1843.26s)]
*  That was not the truth. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1845.42s)]
*  But that's selective memory. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1849.02s)]
*  That's not memory loss. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1850.5600000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1852.0600000000002s)]
*  And good for you for being honest now. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1853.0600000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1855.22s)]
*  You know, it's a surprise. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1856.22s)]
*  We actually have the police officer here. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1857.22s)]
*  Come out here, officer. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1858.94s)]
*  And I only had to serve community service once and that was when I was 16. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1861.38s)]
*  So obviously. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1864.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1865.9s)]
*  What, were you picking up trash? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1866.9s)]
*  I've really turned my life around. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1867.9s)]
*  Were you picking up trash on the highway? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1868.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1869.9s)]
*  Did that come later? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1870.9s)]
*  No. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1871.9s)]
*  I worked at a nursing home. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1872.9s)]
*  I cleaned up piss and served pizza. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1874.38s)]
*  Oh, better than the reverse. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1876.42s)]
*  I hope you didn't clean up the piss with the pizza. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1879.6200000000001s)]
*  No, I did not. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1881.9s)]
*  Jimmy. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1882.9s)]
*  I missed that. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1883.9s)]
*  I am assuming it was disgusting. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1886.9s)]
*  I'll watch it when I get home. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1891.18s)]
*  Jimmy, you're both a media expert and a medical expert. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1892.7800000000002s)]
*  So your phone must be ringing off the hook. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1896.8600000000001s)]
*  Yes, Greg, it is. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1899.14s)]
*  Thank you for pointing that out. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1900.38s)]
*  I watched and listened to the audio of that and he reminded me of me when my wife finds [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1902.66s)]
*  a nude photo of another woman on my phone. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1908.74s)]
*  Tuesday. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1911.1000000000001s)]
*  Who? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1912.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1913.1000000000001s)]
*  She was 17? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1914.1000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1915.1000000000001s)]
*  He's still a better speaker than Kamala when you watch him. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1916.1000000000001s)]
*  Yes, it's true. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1924.42s)]
*  But they are, I felt bad for him. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1925.98s)]
*  I really felt bad for him. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1928.98s)]
*  He's just an old guy who's losing his memory. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1930.82s)]
*  I made me hate the press so much more than I've already hated them for years because [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1934.82s)]
*  they knew. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1939.58s)]
*  I don't blame him again as vice president. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1940.58s)]
*  What is Kamala going to say? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1941.58s)]
*  She can't get up to the podium and go, yeah, he's got tomato soup for brains. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1943.06s)]
*  She's got to act like he's doing great, but the press is just unforgivable. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1947.74s)]
*  Yeah, the thing is that's why I don't, like, I don't, even the Democrats are going to lie [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1950.9399999999998s)]
*  whenever they can. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1956.4199999999998s)]
*  You can't just blame them for everybody in politics lies. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1957.6799999999998s)]
*  But the media is not supposed to pick a side. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1960.26s)]
*  Kennedy, what do you think about my theory? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1961.82s)]
*  And I think I'm the only one who's floated this because I'm a weirdo that it's not a [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1964.5s)]
*  disability. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1968.86s)]
*  It was a debility that that in which they deliberately kept Biden kind of frail and [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1969.86s)]
*  weak because he was easier to manage. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1975.6599999999999s)]
*  They could pass whatever they wanted. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1978.78s)]
*  He didn't ask questions because he was always tired. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1980.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm going to give you a label for this. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1983.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1984.86s)]
*  Political Munchausen syndrome. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1985.86s)]
*  Oh, they made. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1986.86s)]
*  They made the president even sicker and kept him debilitated. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1987.86s)]
*  So people would go, oh, my goodness, all of you around him, you are so incredibly brave. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=1997.58s)]
*  You know, Dr. Jill, Corinne Jean-Pierre, Ron Klain, you are doing the Lord's work here. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=2003.3s)]
*  And meanwhile, like, if you if you listen to stories about the debate prep, they kept [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=2010.9199999999998s)]
*  him going. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=2015.2199999999998s)]
*  They were pushing and pushing. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=2016.2199999999998s)]
*  I don't know what it says in those books because they wanted him exhausted. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=2017.6200000000001s)]
*  I think they wanted him absolutely depleted. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=2020.66s)]
*  I think you're absolutely I think you're totally right. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=2023.22s)]
*  I think that they would have him do like things right before he had to do something. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb1GtOaqiR8&t=2025.98s)]
