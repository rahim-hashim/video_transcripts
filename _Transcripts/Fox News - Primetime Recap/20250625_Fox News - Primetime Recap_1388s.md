# Fox News Highlights - June 24th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo)
*  First, don't mess with Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=2.0s)]
*  Now, when President Trump took to truth social to announce the ceasefire late yesterday, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  the atmosphere was jubilant, but with an asterisk, if both sides truly lived up to the agreement. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=11.16s)]
*  But for whatever reason, Israel decided to proceed, a lot of people think, in bad faith [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=17.56s)]
*  and use the intervening hours to drop a hell of a lot of bombs on Iran. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=22.12s)]
*  And Iran, lobsome too, but nothing compared to what Netanyahu authorized. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=26.68s)]
*  At 7 15 a.m. this morning, Trump dropped his own bomb on Bibi. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=31.48s)]
*  I'm not happy with them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=38.16s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=39.72s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=41.68s)]
*  land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=46.56s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=50.36s)]
*  You know what? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=51.84s)]
*  We have we basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  they don't know what the **** they're doing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=59.720000000000006s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=61.84s)]
*  Some of us heard the actual F bomb. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=63.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, Maronite on that for a moment, especially considering what liberals have accused him [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=66.28s)]
*  of vis a vis Israel. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=70.88s)]
*  The New Republic called him all time Bibi lapdog among American presidents and the regime [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  and Obama's henchmen with their limited thinking thought they had Trump pegged. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  He didn't know what Israel was going to do and was ultimately being goaded and dogwalked [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  by the prime minister of Israel into this war. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  I think this is Bibi Netanyahu and the Israelis that convinced Trump to disregard the position [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  of his of the U.S. intelligence community. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  And when I think of the word credibility, Brennan comes to mind. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  Never. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  Trump wants peace and he expects and demands that our allies make good on their promises, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=108.98s)]
*  whether regarding NATO military spending or regarding a ceasefire as important as this [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=114.86s)]
*  is. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  I'm glad that Trump was angry before most Americans had even opened their eyes. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=120.54s)]
*  And wouldn't you know Trump gets results? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  Israel seems to have gotten the message. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  Its defense minister told Pete Hegseth that Israel is deeply grateful to President Trump [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=131.78s)]
*  and will respect the ceasefire as long as Iran does, too. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=137.34s)]
*  He also promised to strengthen the national security cooperation between the United States [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=141.22s)]
*  and Israel. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=145.66s)]
*  Well, that's better. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=146.66s)]
*  Let's hope it holds. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=148.42s)]
*  Now even though the Trump haters refuse to see it, they refuse for one moment to consider [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=150.42s)]
*  the possibility that Donald Trump is the most powerful force for peace that America has [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  seen certainly since Reagan. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=161.56s)]
*  But if they could step outside of their own bubble of Trump loathing for a moment, they'd [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=164.42s)]
*  see him as something they could actually work with, not as an ideologue, but above all as [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=170.14s)]
*  a realist who puts America first. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=176.26s)]
*  Do you want to see regime change in Iran? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=179.61999999999998s)]
*  If there was, there was. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  But no, I don't want to. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  I'd like to see everything come down as quickly as possible. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  Regime change takes chaos, and ideally we don't want to see so much chaos. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=189.74s)]
*  So we'll see how it does. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=194.34s)]
*  You know, the Iranians are very good traders, very good business people, and they got a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=195.34s)]
*  lot of oil. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=200.38s)]
*  They should be fine. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=201.38s)]
*  They should be able to rebuild and do a good job. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=202.38s)]
*  Now that's a smart answer. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=206.02s)]
*  He was never for America forcing regime change. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=208.18s)]
*  That never works out. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=212.3s)]
*  But of course, if the regime changed to leadership we could work with, that'd be great. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  I think that's his point. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=218.34s)]
*  And politically, it's never ever good to be on the side that seems to be hoping for the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=220.3s)]
*  worst. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=225.54000000000002s)]
*  Hoping for inflation, hoping that tariffs drive up prices, hoping that the Fed keeps [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=226.98000000000002s)]
*  interest rates high, hoping that the ceasefire doesn't last. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=231.58s)]
*  This ceasefire may be more in Donald Trump's imagination than in reality. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  I want to see evidence on the ground in real time that there is a ceasefire. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=242.5s)]
*  I am deeply concerned that chaos and confusion seem to be the United States brand of foreign [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=248.62s)]
*  policy right now. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=254.7s)]
*  What a sad state of affairs for my home state of Connecticut. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=255.7s)]
*  Blumenthal is the senator there. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=259.38s)]
*  Rooting for failure just because it would hurt Trump. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=260.98s)]
*  All afternoon CNN was salivating over the prospect that Iran's nuclear capabilities [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=267.54s)]
*  had not been obliterated as Trump had indicated. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  Early intel indicating that the strikes set back the Iranian nuclear program for months, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=275.56s)]
*  but perhaps not entirely. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  The first intel assessment comes from the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=282.68s)]
*  intel wing, and this early look was apparently leaked as its details are top secret. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=287.46000000000004s)]
*  Now it was reportedly based on the evidence presented by CENTCOM. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=294.97999999999996s)]
*  Again, it is their belief that the Iranian nuclear program was sent back significantly, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=298.34s)]
*  but not destroyed. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  Secretary of Defense Hegseth responded to this saying, quote, based on everything we've [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=306.14s)]
*  seen our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=310.38s)]
*  And White House press secretary Caroline Levitt shot back, calling the assessment, quote, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=316.32s)]
*  flat out wrong and a clear attempt to demean President Trump. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=320.3s)]
*  Now knowing President Trump, I think I know him pretty well, he's going to demand answers [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=325.74s)]
*  here. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=330.34000000000003s)]
*  After all, before he greenlit the bombing, he wanted assurances that the bunker busters [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=331.34000000000003s)]
*  could do the trick. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  So if it turns out that he was given assessments that were too optimistic, then heads should [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=338.3s)]
*  roll. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=344.02s)]
*  Today, the White House abruptly canceled its intel briefings for Congress on the Iranian [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=345.02s)]
*  strikes, which infuriated some members of the relevant committees. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=350.06s)]
*  The administration has a legal obligation to inform Congress precisely about what is [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=354.62s)]
*  happening. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=359.86s)]
*  I think the fact that they canceled this briefing today just goes to show how chaotic this administration [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=360.86s)]
*  really is. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=366.86s)]
*  Clearly, the chaos and the confusion coming out of the White House made that impossible. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=367.86s)]
*  It is completely unacceptable that Congress has not been briefed on this in a timely fashion. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=373.46000000000004s)]
*  Calm down, kids. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  Speaker Johnson said the briefing will take place on Friday. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=381.98s)]
*  But this shows you how high the tensions are running. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=386.48s)]
*  And look, they think they can score politically on this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=388.94s)]
*  They're going to do it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=391.34000000000003s)]
*  That's what the Democrats do. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=392.34000000000003s)]
*  But one thing we know for sure, to all of you Trump foes out there, underestimate him [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=394.3s)]
*  at your own peril. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=400.78s)]
*  The mullahs didn't read him right. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=403.02s)]
*  They thought he was going to balk at intervention. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=404.5s)]
*  Some Republicans didn't read him right. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=407.5s)]
*  They thought he was an isolationist. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  And Democrats didn't read him right. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  They thought he'd go in half cocked and start World War III. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=413.05999999999995s)]
*  All of them are wrong. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=416.85999999999996s)]
*  So don't mess with Trump. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=418.85999999999996s)]
*  He'll fight as hard for peace as he does for border enforcement, for tax cuts, and for [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=420.65999999999997s)]
*  cutting the bureaucracy. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=426.14s)]
*  And he has common sense. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=428.34s)]
*  And patriotic Americans are on his side. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=430.35999999999996s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=433.78s)]
*  So how did this ceasefire deal between Iran and Israel actually get negotiated? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=435.53999999999996s)]
*  We know President Trump was directly involved talking with Bibi Netanyahu, while Vance, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=442.58s)]
*  Rubio, and my next guest talked with the Iranians. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=447.53999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump's city expected the ceasefire to last forever. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=451.97999999999996s)]
*  Then both sides violated it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=455.58s)]
*  Iran broke the truce first, and then Israel hit back. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=457.84s)]
*  Trump found out about it right before he left for Holland. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=461.52s)]
*  And he wasn't even this mad after he got shot. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=464.03999999999996s)]
*  When I say, OK, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=467.35999999999996s)]
*  everything you have on them. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=472.09999999999997s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=474.96s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=476.91999999999996s)]
*  land that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=481.78s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  You know what? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=486.6s)]
*  We have we basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=487.6s)]
*  they don't know what the f*** they're doing. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=492.88s)]
*  You understand that? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=495.12s)]
*  On Air Force One, he dialed Netanyahu and barked at him. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=496.52000000000004s)]
*  Sources say Trump was really angry, told him to knock it off. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=499.96000000000004s)]
*  Unlike Biden, when Trump says don't, people listen. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=503.56s)]
*  And the ceasefires held since then. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=507.1s)]
*  Iran's at its weakest point since the 80s. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=510.20000000000005s)]
*  And Israel just cleaned out their whole neighborhood and they should probably take the win. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=512.36s)]
*  The question is, does Israel disobey Trump and assassinate the Ayatollah? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=517.26s)]
*  Does he get couped? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=521.92s)]
*  Or does he remain in power? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=523.36s)]
*  Do you want to see regime change in Iran? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=525.88s)]
*  If there was, there was. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=528.24s)]
*  But no, I don't want to. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=530.12s)]
*  I'd like to see everything calm down as quickly as possible. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=531.12s)]
*  Regime change takes chaos. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=536.0s)]
*  And ideally, we don't want to see so much chaos. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=538.4s)]
*  Iran's being strangled by sanctions, their currency's out of control, and they're running [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=541.16s)]
*  out of missiles. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=545.04s)]
*  Trump says the solution is to stop trading rockets and trade products. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=546.66s)]
*  They're not going to have enrichment and they're not going to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=550.6s)]
*  And they know that they're going to get on to being a great trading nation. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=554.68s)]
*  You know they're very good traders. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=558.76s)]
*  And they're going to be a great trading nation and they have a lot of oil. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=559.76s)]
*  They're going to do well. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=564.76s)]
*  They're not going to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=565.76s)]
*  So do they promise? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=568.76s)]
*  The only thing on Iran's mind right now is nuclear weapons. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=569.76s)]
*  So far, Operation Midnight Hammer's delivered. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=573.48s)]
*  No casualties, no escalation, and a ceasefire. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=576.24s)]
*  But Obama's CIA director, who is knee deep in the Russia hoax, says Trump blew it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=579.84s)]
*  I think the credibility of this administration really has been shattered. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=586.16s)]
*  I mean, I don't think it was ever strong, but it has been shattered over the past several [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=588.8s)]
*  weeks. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=592.0s)]
*  The U.S. intelligence community, by all accounts, still assesses that Iran has not restarted [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=593.0s)]
*  their nuclear weapons program, which they suspended in 2003. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=597.16s)]
*  How would he know? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  He doesn't even have a clearance anymore. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  If Iran's nuclear program's peaceful, why'd they hide it in a mountain? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=604.4399999999999s)]
*  CNN says the bunker busters we dropped didn't work. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=608.8399999999999s)]
*  The Defense Intelligence Agency has assessed that the core components of Iran's nuclear [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=613.4s)]
*  program are largely intact and that Iran's nuclear program has essentially only been [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=618.5s)]
*  set back by months. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=623.72s)]
*  Press Secretary Caroline Levitt says this. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=626.0s)]
*  This CNN story was written by the same reporter who wrote the very first fake news story claiming [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=628.16s)]
*  the Hunter Biden laptop was disinformation. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=634.08s)]
*  Now, I don't know who Trump's madder at. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=636.52s)]
*  Iran and Israel? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=639.8s)]
*  Or CNN and MSNBC? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=640.88s)]
*  That place is demolished. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=643.6s)]
*  The B-2 pilots did their job, but when I see CNN all night long, they're trying to say, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=644.6s)]
*  well, maybe it wasn't really as demolished as we thought. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=650.56s)]
*  It was demolished. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=653.8s)]
*  And I will say, I think CNN ought to apologize to the pilots of the B-2s. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=655.04s)]
*  I think that MSNBC ought to apologize. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=660.24s)]
*  I think these guys, really, these networks and these cable networks are real losers. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=663.8399999999999s)]
*  You're gutless losers. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=669.64s)]
*  I say that to CNN because I watch it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=671.0s)]
*  I have no choice. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=673.88s)]
*  I've got to watch that garbage. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=674.88s)]
*  It's all garbage. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=675.88s)]
*  It's all fake news. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=676.88s)]
*  But I think CNN is a gutless group of people. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=677.88s)]
*  The International Atomic Energy Agency is saying CNN doesn't know what the heck they're [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=681.96s)]
*  talking about. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=686.6s)]
*  They're saying our bunker busters actually caused more damage than was actually first [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=688.44s)]
*  thought. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=693.08s)]
*  The IAEA chief says the strikes were so accurate, the site's probably contaminated and overflowing [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=694.08s)]
*  with hazardous chemicals. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=700.52s)]
*  How far back do you believe Iran's nuclear weapons program has been set by these strikes? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=703.26s)]
*  Is it months? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=711.4s)]
*  Is it years? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=712.4s)]
*  Well, I think the nuclear program, the Iranian nuclear program, has been set back significantly. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=713.4s)]
*  Significantly. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=721.4s)]
*  The Pentagon said the sites were obliterated. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=722.64s)]
*  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff called it extreme destruction and devastation. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=725.12s)]
*  And Trump's chief negotiator says this. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=730.34s)]
*  Well, it goes without saying that leaking that type of information, whatever the information, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=733.44s)]
*  whatever site it comes out on, is outrageous. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=739.16s)]
*  It's treasonous. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=741.84s)]
*  So it ought to be investigated. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=743.44s)]
*  And whoever did it, whoever's responsible for it, should be held accountable. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=745.48s)]
*  There's no doubt that it breached the canopy. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=750.08s)]
*  There's no doubt that it was well within reach of the depth that these bunker buster bombs [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=752.84s)]
*  go to. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=757.44s)]
*  And there's no doubt that it was obliterated. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=758.7s)]
*  So the reporting out there that in some ways suggests that we did not achieve the objective [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=760.5600000000001s)]
*  is just completely preposterous. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=768.8000000000001s)]
*  Even Obama's CIA director said the American operation set the Iranian nuclear program [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=771.24s)]
*  back years. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=776.76s)]
*  There's no question that there has been very, very significant damage done to all of the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=778.72s)]
*  known nuclear sites within Iran. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=783.32s)]
*  And I suspect that this has indeed set the program back much, much more than many months. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=787.0s)]
*  But the bomb damage assessment process does need to be complete to validate that. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=792.2s)]
*  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I think, was correct when he said there was severe [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=797.08s)]
*  damage. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=800.84s)]
*  No question about that. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=801.84s)]
*  You're certain it set the program back several years? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=803.2s)]
*  It does. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=806.5200000000001s)]
*  To your point. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=807.5200000000001s)]
*  I'm confident that it did. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=808.5200000000001s)]
*  So we're dropping 30,000-pound bombs on our enemy, and the only one saying we didn't make [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=810.6800000000001s)]
*  a dent are Iran and CNN. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=816.8000000000001s)]
*  CNN's just parroting enemy propaganda. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  They're saying the people who chant death to America are mostly peaceful. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=822.96s)]
*  I remember, Dan, at one point being in Tehran years ago, and they're chanting death to America [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=828.08s)]
*  all around me, even as I say, oh, I'm an American reporting for CNN, and they were happy to [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=833.96s)]
*  speak to me. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=838.9200000000001s)]
*  So those two sort of jarring realities of the chant and yet the friendliness have existed [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=839.9200000000001s)]
*  together. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=847.5400000000001s)]
*  So they're telling us Iran was never close to nukes. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=848.5400000000001s)]
*  Then they tell us Trump never hit the target, and now they're saying terrorists are good [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=851.56s)]
*  people. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=855.28s)]
*  These are the same people that believed everything the Biden White House told them. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=856.28s)]
*  The president's in great shape. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=862.1999999999999s)]
*  The border's secure. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=863.68s)]
*  No inflation. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=865.0s)]
*  They believed it all. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=866.7199999999999s)]
*  But when Trump bombs Iran and everyone says the damage was devastating, CNN says, I'm [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=868.56s)]
*  going to believe the terrorists who chant death to America. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=873.88s)]
*  The Israelis have been bombing the hell out of Iran for 12 straight days, hitting every [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=877.34s)]

*  Nuclear, industrial, oil, command and control. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=883.58s)]
*  Every top general's dead. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=887.4200000000001s)]
*  Every nuclear scientist is dead. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=888.9s)]
*  All three nuclear sites were hit with tomahawks and bunker busters, and they're sitting in [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=891.58s)]
*  a pile of rubble. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=896.34s)]
*  The country's broke. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=897.9s)]
*  The supreme leader is in hiding, hasn't been heard from for days. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=899.14s)]
*  And CNN's saying our bombs didn't work. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=904.02s)]
*  And Iran's still this close to a nuke? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=906.86s)]
*  Because they heard it from an anonymous leaker at the Pentagon? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=910.7s)]
*  It's funny how CNN had all these great sources all of a sudden, but for four years, not a [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=914.7s)]
*  single source leaked that Biden was falling asleep in his soup. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=921.98s)]
*  Even Biden's national security guys say mission accomplished. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=926.46s)]
*  This is about the best place we can be. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=930.98s)]
*  I give extremely high marks to this national security team and President Trump for managing [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=933.06s)]
*  this crisis. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=937.3s)]
*  Trump on Air Force One, feeling pretty good. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=938.9399999999999s)]
*  At one point, he's scolding that Nyahoo, and then he's telling Putin, you're next. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=941.3s)]
*  As you know, Vladimir called me up. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=946.66s)]
*  He said, can I help you with the rent? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=948.14s)]
*  I said, no, I don't need help with the rent. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=949.8599999999999s)]
*  I need help with you. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=951.26s)]
*  And I hope we're going to be getting a deal done with Russia. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=953.26s)]
*  It's a shame. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=957.2199999999999s)]
*  Basking in the glow of a bold bombing campaign and a ceasefire, Trump arrived in the Netherlands [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=958.7s)]
*  to great news. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=963.58s)]
*  Our NATO allies are finally paying their fair share. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=965.22s)]
*  For decades, the United States sought to get Europe to truly step up. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=969.8000000000001s)]
*  Now European allies and Canada will equalize their defense spending with the United States. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=975.1s)]
*  So let me salute President Trump's longstanding leadership in calling for NATO to increase [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=981.5s)]
*  defense spending. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=987.46s)]
*  Mr. President, dear Donald, that is thanks to you pushing us. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=988.46s)]
*  Whether it's real bombs or F bombs, we're seeing results. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=994.94s)]
*  Our allies are listening to us and our enemies are scared of us. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=998.86s)]
*  The president's heading in July 4th weekend with political clout, peace, a hot stock market [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1002.4200000000001s)]
*  and low energy prices. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1008.34s)]
*  As Buck Sexton said last night, the trend is our friend. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1010.48s)]
*  President Trump means what he says. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1014.4200000000001s)]
*  Just listen to his words. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1015.86s)]
*  He's not that hard to figure out. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1017.24s)]
*  You can call it the Trump doctrine if you want, but it is simply a fact. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1018.98s)]
*  And despite all the smears from the state run legacy media mob, Trump has always called [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1022.84s)]
*  for global peace. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1028.1200000000001s)]
*  Sometimes that means you got to get tough with both your enemies and your friends. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1029.76s)]
*  Take a look earlier today. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1033.84s)]
*  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1034.84s)]
*  the likes of which I've never seen before. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1039.64s)]
*  The biggest load that we've seen. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1041.94s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1043.68s)]
*  When I say, OK, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1046.04s)]
*  everything you have on them. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1050.8s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1052.04s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1053.6399999999999s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1055.6s)]
*  didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1060.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1064.28s)]
*  You know what? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1065.76s)]
*  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1068.44s)]
*  don't know what the f*** they're doing. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1073.96s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1075.8000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1076.8000000000002s)]
*  After a tenuous start, the ceasefire is now back on track. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1077.8000000000002s)]
*  Keep in mind, this is a ceasefire less than one week after President Trump obliterated [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1080.44s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program with a massive strike. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1085.3200000000002s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1087.8000000000002s)]
*  The strike was a tremendous success thanks to several bunker buster bombs that penetrated [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1089.14s)]
*  a mountain and exploded deep underground. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1094.3000000000002s)]
*  Fordow, their nuclear plant, really no longer exists. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1097.44s)]
*  We'll get the full assessment in days ahead. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1100.88s)]
*  Now, there will be a lot of hard work ahead in terms of achieving a lasting peace. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1103.08s)]
*  That will include checks and balances and measures in place to prevent Iran from ever [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1109.04s)]
*  rebuilding anything nuclear. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1114.04s)]
*  This should also include Iran's recognition of Israel and of course anywhere, any place, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1116.76s)]
*  any time inspections, and that would be American inspections. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1122.1599999999999s)]
*  And of course, a full accounting of all enriched uranium that the Iranians may have moved. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1126.04s)]
*  That has got to be a part of it as well. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1131.3400000000001s)]
*  My message to Iran, tried to warn you before Donald Trump dropped those bunker busters. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1133.16s)]
*  If you think you will be clever and you think you'll be able to use your proxies like Hamas [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1139.2s)]
*  and Bola, the Houthi rebels or others to attack Israel, then that war will be back on immediately [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1143.8600000000001s)]
*  and Donald Trump will not come to the rescue and stop Israel this time. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1150.96s)]
*  He knows that they are acting on orders from you, the Iranian leadership, or whoever's [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1155.0800000000002s)]
*  From this point forward, Iran's radical leaders, they are committing suicide any and every [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1161.14s)]
*  time they dare attack Israel, either directly or indirectly through their proxies. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1166.3400000000001s)]
*  But what President Trump has been able to accomplish in the last week is incredible. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1171.78s)]
*  It is historic. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1176.38s)]
*  So many presidents talked about it. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1177.7s)]
*  None of them ever did it. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1179.38s)]
*  And of course, it is driving the Democrats and the media mob predictably absolutely crazy. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1180.38s)]
*  Instead of congratulations, we are seeing condemnation from the left. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1186.66s)]
*  Insanely, some are even accusing Donald Trump of committing an illegal act. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1190.46s)]
*  And even today, 79 Democrats in Congress voted to impeach the president for daring to breach [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1195.5400000000002s)]
*  the 1973 War Powers Act, which, as Greg Jarrett points out, quote, it is a notification requirement. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1201.0600000000002s)]
*  And he did notify the leadership on the Democratic side and Republican side in Congress, not [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1208.72s)]
*  a prohibition on the president's right to exert military action. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1214.52s)]
*  And the president did, in fact, notify those people in Congress he needed to notify. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1218.7s)]
*  Just to be clear, as Greg Jarrett points out, under Article 2 of the Constitution, the president [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1223.28s)]
*  is the commander in chief of the armed forces, and that empowers him to direct military operations [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1229.2s)]
*  to deter foreign threats to our national security without conferring with Jasmine Crockett. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1235.48s)]
*  Now, this has been well established over the course of our republic. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1241.24s)]
*  No president has ever abided by the War Powers Act ever. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1244.92s)]
*  And the act itself even allows presidents a 60-day window to strike at any enemy if [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1250.16s)]
*  they deem necessary. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1255.64s)]
*  On top of that, after 9-11, Congress specifically authorized additional powers for a president, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1257.44s)]
*  granting explicit power to target nations linked to terrorism. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1264.8000000000002s)]
*  That would be Iran. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1268.68s)]
*  The number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1270.12s)]
*  But if Democrats actually disagree with these facts, where then was the outrage? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1272.08s)]
*  When Joe Biden bombed Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, or when Barack Obama ordered strikes [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1277.1999999999998s)]
*  against Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Pakistan? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1282.6799999999998s)]
*  Obama even ordered a drone strike against a U.S. citizen in Yemen, and yet Democrats [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1288.36s)]
*  then didn't care a whit. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1294.2399999999998s)]
*  In fact, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1295.88s)]
*  Ford, Richard Nixon, Lyndon B. Johnson, all ordered strikes without congressional approval. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1302.16s)]
*  There's your Hannity history lesson. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1307.7600000000002s)]
*  But Democrats, why let facts get in the way of a great smear campaign against President [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1309.64s)]
*  Trump? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1314.16s)]
*  They live, eat, breathe, sleep hating Trump. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1315.16s)]
*  If the dog bites, the bee stings, you're feeling sad, blame Trump. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1318.44s)]
*  If Trump cures cancer, blame him for that too. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1322.16s)]
*  They don't like Donald Trump. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1325.46s)]
*  They don't like that he has emerged as the real one true leader of the free world. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1326.98s)]
*  Other presidents only made proclamations about Iran and their nuclear program. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1332.32s)]
*  Donald Trump brought them to their knees. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1337.26s)]
*  Other presidents politely encouraged NATO members to, you know, take their defense seriously, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1339.66s)]
*  pay their fair share. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1345.22s)]
*  Donald Trump got them to start paying their fair share as of today. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1346.58s)]
*  Other presidents looked the other way while Europe, you know, was piping in oil and gas [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1351.12s)]
*  at lower rates from Russia, you know, funding Putin's war machine while Donald Trump was [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1355.32s)]
*  calling them out for doing that very thing and then wanting money for defense. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1360.1599999999999s)]
*  And now, by the way, at the NATO meeting that's going on in the Netherlands, Europe's leaders [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1364.6399999999999s)]
*  have finally come to the realization that President Trump has been right the entire [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1368.56s)]
*  time about every major issue facing the world. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAweA1BmmUo&t=1372.6s)]
