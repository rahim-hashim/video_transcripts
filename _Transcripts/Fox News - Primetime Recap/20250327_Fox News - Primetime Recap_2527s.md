# Fox News Highlights - March 26, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight. Do we have a show for you tonight? We have the weed moms represented. Do you [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=5.0s)]
*  know who they are? Yeah. We have the signal chat issue. There's so much to get to, and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=10.56s)]
*  we'll get through all of it together. But first, let's chat. That's the focus of tonight's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=15.64s)]
*  angle. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Senate Republicans have asked, said that they have formally asked the administration for [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  an inspector general report on the signal issue. Will you agree to that? It doesn't [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=25.8s)]
*  bother me. I don't know. I want to find if there's any mistake or if a signal doesn't [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=32.04s)]
*  work. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=37.88s)]
*  As for the question of who's responsible, the president said this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=38.88s)]
*  ... successful that night. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=43.0s)]
*  Hexeth is doing a great job. He had nothing to do with this. Hexeth. How do you bring [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=44.8s)]
*  Hexeth into it? He had nothing to do. Look, look, it's all a witch hunt. Mike did, he [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=54.72s)]
*  took responsibility for it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, there's lots of buzz across all networks and the internet about the Angle's interview [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  last night with the national security adviser, Mike Waltz. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=66.24s)]
*  He's obviously doing cleanup for all of this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=70.44s)]
*  There's not a single adult in the crowd who will actually take responsibility for what [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=72.36s)]
*  happened. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=76.92s)]
*  The main thing to do is admit that it was a screw up on somebody's part. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=77.92s)]
*  Do you know what everybody would love? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=81.32s)]
*  We made a mistake. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=83.68s)]
*  I don't think they're telling the truth and it doesn't pass the smell test. There is no [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=84.68s)]
*  way in hell that that's not classified information. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=89.08000000000001s)]
*  Okay, let's chat. No doubt including Goldberg in these communications was a screw up. We [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  said that last night. It's an unforced error and a mislabeled contact added to a high level [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=97.44000000000001s)]
*  chat, which of course gave the anti-Trump henchmen on the left an opening. And that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  means the White House is forced to defend the accusations of mishandling of war plans [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  and classified info. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  Nobody's texting war plans. Team update is to provide updates in real time. General updates [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=115.27999999999999s)]
*  in real time. Keep everybody informed. That's what I did. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  This thing was set up for purposes of coordinating how everyone was going to call. You know, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=126.16s)]
*  when these things happen, I need to call foreign ministers, especially of our close allies. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=131.24s)]
*  We need to notify members of Congress. Obviously someone made a mistake. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=135.4s)]
*  I would characterize this messaging thread as a policy discussion, a sensitive policy [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=139.36s)]
*  discussion surely amongst high level cabinet officials and senior staff. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=143.88000000000002s)]
*  Well Caroline's right. And I'm sure in retrospect they all wish they had been on a secure White [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=148.8s)]
*  House line or just in the situation room. And it's also fair to say that Republicans [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=153.32000000000002s)]
*  would express outrage if the shoe were on the other foot with the same set of facts. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=158.34s)]
*  Let's also remember the Democrat wall of support for Hillary Clinton's use of a private, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=163.96s)]
*  unsecure server for official government emails and attachments. Yeah, I remember all of that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=170.96s)]
*  As the AP noted at the time, 47 emails contain CIA information related to specific agency [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  personnel or agency matters and that the server was vulnerable to hacking by foreign adversaries. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  Nevertheless, her party rallied to her defense and to this day it maintains she did nothing [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=190.92s)]
*  wrong. Of course, in her own act of glaring hypocrisy, Hillary weighed in in an exclusive [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  interview with the esteemed foreign policy magazine Glamour. As if that woman has a scintilla [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=204.56s)]
*  of credibility on any issue related to national security. Exactly what is her list of successes? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=210.76s)]
*  From Haiti to Benghazi, she was a total disaster. But the reality of the situation here, I think, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=217.92s)]
*  actually is fairly straightforward. When you look at these texts in their entirety, and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=226.72s)]
*  of course more were released today, they show a serious and thoughtful group of advisors [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  trying to carry out the clear wishes of the duly elected and totally competent commander-in-chief. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=235.29999999999998s)]
*  Sure, we're going to find out again who put the Trump-Haiting Goldberg on the chat chain [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  and why, but it's abundantly clear that none of this put national security at risk. And [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=246.84s)]
*  there was no risk to our troops and the entire world is safer because of the actions that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=252.12s)]
*  our troops took. Now, some of us are actually happier about that. Others are rooting for [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=256.8s)]
*  the United States to fail. What's also clear, rather than getting off the text chain immediately [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=262.84s)]
*  and contacting the administration through back channels, which would have been the proper [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=270.2s)]
*  and appropriate thing to do, the Atlantic editor held the information. And what did [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=274.8s)]
*  he do? He dumped it right before the important hearing of the Senate Select Committee on [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  Intelligence. Now, Goldberg obviously wanted to do as much damage to the Trump administration [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=285.24s)]
*  as possible for maximum impact. The fact is, the Atlantic views MAGA and Trump as the real [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=290.84s)]
*  villains of the world, much worse than the CCP, much worse than Hamas. What the media [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=298.23999999999995s)]
*  will not and cannot address is that the mission to destroy Quihuti targets was itself a huge [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=305.08s)]
*  success. So I think we should judge a policy by its outcome, not by an unintended error [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=311.28s)]
*  in transmission. And it's an error, by the way, that all parties have learned from. But [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  think about the incompetence we dealt with for four long years of Joe Biden. Now, we [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=323.76s)]
*  probably had Generals Milley and Lloyd Austin in a lead-walled skiff discussing how they [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=330.4s)]
*  were going to pull our troops out of Afghanistan. But the results would, you know, they were [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=337.12s)]
*  still disastrous, right? And they were deadly. And I'll say this, at least Hegseth was on [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=342.32s)]
*  this chat and an active participant. I mean, who can forget when Biden's secretary of defense, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  Lloyd Austin, was missing from the job for several days, and apparently no one at the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  Biden White House even noticed. That's how important he was to decision-making. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=358.84s)]
*  So you want to talk about a compromised foreign policy? Let's chat. Joe Biden was our [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=363.56s)]
*  commander-in-chief, and the press, including Goldberg's publication, ignored obvious and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  blatant concerns about his mental competence, his mental state, for years. And they [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  vilified those of us who brought up those concerns. And you want to talk about a chaotic [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=381.36s)]
*  and dangerous foreign policy? The Russian invasion of Ukraine itself. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=386.8s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of dead. Russia obviously the aggressor here, but it only happened [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=392.04s)]
*  because of Team Biden's stupidity. You want to talk about putting Americans in harm's [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  way and the ultimate insult to Americans in uniform? Yeah, Biden looking at his watch at [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=402.6s)]
*  Dover during the dignified transfer. The truth is the globalists like Goldberg and his [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=409.6s)]
*  compatriots have gotten almost everything wrong about U.S. foreign policy over the past [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=415.8s)]
*  30 years. The same people who said a rising China was a good thing and no threat to the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=420.76s)]
*  United States are the same people who promised us that Ukraine's summer offensive would [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  turn the tide against Russia. So it doesn't matter how successful Trump's foreign policy [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=431.72s)]
*  is. It doesn't matter. Goldberg and others like him will continue to long for the glorious [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=437.44s)]
*  days of Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden when America was getting weaker as China was getting [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=441.64s)]
*  stronger. The truth is most feigning outrage over the signal chat are really outraged that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=446.76s)]
*  under Trump America is now acting in her own interest. Their idea of a successful Republican [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=454.52s)]
*  is Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney. Maybe throw them all together. And now that it's becoming [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=462.08s)]
*  increasingly obvious that the voters have chosen the America first approach to domestic [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  and foreign policy, I mean the old guard, the old elites, they're becoming angrier and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=470.91999999999996s)]
*  more desperate by the day. These people helped the Biden administration cover up everything [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=476.44s)]
*  from the Biden Ukraine and China grift to Biden's own declining mental state. I will [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=482.32s)]
*  never forgive them for that. And by the way, that was all going on as our enemies were [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=487.12s)]
*  getting stronger and laughing at us and plotting against us. And we haven't gotten into what [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=491.88s)]
*  happened at the border. How many foreign terrorists crossed our border? I don't remember long [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=497.78000000000003s)]
*  Atlantic articles about that. And we're supposed to take any of these people huffing and puffing [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=502.12s)]
*  today seriously? You know, I was thinking about this. I've been in Washington a long [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=508.64s)]
*  time. This is all a sad repeat of what Republicans have been dealing with since around 1987. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=513.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I worked in the Reagan administration in 1987. From the Bork hearings to Iran [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=519.7199999999999s)]
*  contra to the Russian collusion to the myriad anti-Trump hoaxes, Charlottesville, January [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=525.76s)]
*  6th, it's one long slash and burn campaign. Democrats didn't really care about any of the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=530.88s)]
*  underlying issues involving any of those stories. They cared about gaining a political [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  advantage. So what we're really seeing play out here is the last gasps of the permanent [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=543.2s)]
*  war caucus that took one of the richest and freest countries in the world and almost [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=550.0400000000001s)]
*  destroyed it. Until that is Trump pulled off the biggest comeback of all time. And tonight [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=555.24s)]
*  he's still going strong and it's still driving the people who repeatedly wrote his political [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=562.08s)]
*  obituary mad. And that's the angle. The doze chainsaw has been busy. 130 billion sought [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=568.04s)]
*  off so far, but my favorite cut 600 grand to stop trans boys from getting pregnant. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=575.64s)]
*  Thank God. And 150 grand for climate change activities in Peru. That sounds a lot like [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=581.0799999999999s)]
*  cover for paying off a politician's Peruvian mistress. Back on planet earth, Trump has [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=587.3399999999999s)]
*  targets. Would you be interested in defunding and taking away taxpayer dollars to MPR and [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=593.9399999999999s)]
*  PBS? Well, I would love to do that. I think it's very unfair. It's been very biased with [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=600.9399999999999s)]
*  a whole group. I mean, a whole group of them. As luck would have it, the house doze committee [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=606.42s)]
*  welcomed the presidents of NPR and PBS for a hearing today. You called him a deranged [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=611.66s)]
*  racist and sociopath. You posted on X that America is addicted to white supremacy. It's [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=618.86s)]
*  appalling. You've publicly chastised using the phrase boy and girl, the federal funding [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=628.02s)]
*  that your outlet receives comes from all American taxpayer dollars, not just from your viewers [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=634.18s)]
*  who support such statements as these. We spend a half a billion a year for these stations [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=642.74s)]
*  to call half the country illiterate Nazis. Why are taxpayers funding channels for snobby [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=647.62s)]
*  women with dirty tote bags whose liberal dogs bite me while I'm hiking? I don't know. You [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=652.74s)]
*  turn on the radio or serious or Spotify. There's thousands of stations. Why are we funding [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=658.66s)]
*  the one station that shows drag queens to kids? NPR and PBS have increasingly become [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=664.02s)]
*  radical left wing echo chambers for a narrow audience of mostly wealthy white urban liberals [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=670.74s)]
*  and progressives who generally look down on and judge rural America. PBS news is not just [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=680.6600000000001s)]
*  left leaning, but it is actively uses taxpayer funds to push some of the most radical left [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=688.1800000000001s)]
*  positions like featuring a drag queen on the show. Let's learn. No wonder all these kids [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=695.18s)]
*  think they're trans. They've grown up on drag queen story hour. I wrote this book because [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=702.18s)]
*  I wanted everyone to get to experience the magic of drag and to get a little practice [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=707.18s)]
*  shaking their hips or shimmying their shoulders to know how we can feel fabulous inside of [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=713.18s)]
*  our own bodies. Shaking your hips. Why is a guy wearing makeup and a dress telling kids [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=720.18s)]
*  to shimmy shimmy shake and why are we paying for it? Democrats are cool with it. They treated [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=728.54s)]
*  the whole hearing like a joke. Is Elmo now or has he ever been a member of the communist [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=734.62s)]
*  party of the United States? Yes or no? No. Are Bert and Ernie part of an extreme homosexual [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=740.7399999999999s)]
*  agenda? No. If we're going to get rid of any puppeteers, we should get rid of the one that's [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=746.9s)]
*  actually controlling Donald Trump. Fire Elon Musk and save Elmo. No one's saying Bert and [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=752.26s)]
*  Ernie are gay commies. We're saying the drag queen might be. I had my producers check to [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=758.9s)]
*  see if Bert and Ernie were gay. Here's what we found. A former Sesame Street writer says [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=764.5s)]
*  he wrote Bert and Ernie as a gay couple, but Sesame Street swears they're just roommates. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=769.4399999999999s)]
*  Anyway, Sesame Street in Iraq got dozed, but we're still paying for it here. We're also [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=775.6999999999999s)]
*  paying for this. Here's a straight news show on PBS, or not so straight. First, there's [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=780.4599999999999s)]
*  two sexes is what they say. We know for a fact that there's three because there's intersex [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=787.4599999999999s)]
*  and that's someone that's been born with some form of both. And so if we know that there's [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=792.16s)]
*  now three, then if you try to say there's black and white, then we know that there's [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=797.02s)]
*  another form of gray and it's different shades from charcoal to light gray. And so if we [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=800.62s)]
*  know for a fact that there's at least three genders in sexist, then we have to start listening [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=805.94s)]
*  and go from there. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=810.64s)]
*  Hmm. Why'd I pay for that? If CNN wants to say that, let them. It's their money. But [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=811.64s)]
*  don't do that with my money. NPR isn't doing much better. The CEO, Catherine Maher, under [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=818.72s)]
*  oath insists her newsroom isn't biased and they follow the highest journalistic standards. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=825.06s)]
*  Is NPR biased? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=832.66s)]
*  Uh, Congressman, I have never seen any instance of political bias determining editorial decisions. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=834.66s)]
*  No. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=840.9799999999999s)]
*  In the DC area, editorial positions at NPR, he said he found 87 registered Democrats, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=841.9799999999999s)]
*  zero Republicans. Is that accurate? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=849.18s)]
*  We do not track the numbers or the voter registration. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=852.18s)]
*  87 to zero and you're not biased. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=854.86s)]
*  I think that is concerning if those numbers are accurate. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=857.5s)]
*  We want to see bias in action. Look at what came out of the mouth of the CEO. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=859.9s)]
*  Do you believe that America is addicted to white supremacy? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=866.7s)]
*  Um, I believe that I tweeted that and I, as I've said earlier, I believe much of my thinking [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=869.94s)]
*  has evolved over the last half decade. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=874.72s)]
*  Do you believe that America believes in black plunder and white democracy? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=877.34s)]
*  I don't believe that, sir. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=881.5s)]
*  You tweeted that in reference to a book you were reading at the time, apparently, The [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=885.14s)]
*  Case for Reparations. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=888.64s)]
*  I don't think I've ever read that book, sir. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=890.5s)]
*  You tweeted about it. You said you took a day off to fully read The Case for Reparations. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=892.78s)]
*  You put that on Twitter in January of 2020. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=898.9s)]
*  This woman hires 87 Democrats and zero Republicans and says America's racist and she wants reparations, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=902.56s)]
*  but in no way is she biased. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=909.26s)]
*  Anyway, all that stuff, she said she forgot. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=911.5s)]
*  She's only 41. Not past her prime, Don Lemon, but she forgot. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=914.94s)]
*  She forgot and she evolved. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=919.5s)]
*  She's forgetting and evolving at the same time. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=922.0s)]
*  Did the head of NPR just play the dumb blonde card? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=925.26s)]
*  Because I find that offensive. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=928.38s)]
*  She also played the I was a different person back then card. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=930.94s)]
*  Can you do that from four years ago? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=935.46s)]
*  I mean, you could do that with something you said in college, but this was four years ago. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=938.82s)]
*  Before she ran NPR, Kathy ran Wikipedia. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=942.82s)]
*  And if you Wikipedia, Jesse Waters actually don't. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=946.82s)]
*  It's not nice. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=950.82s)]
*  Kathy is not about telling the truth. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=951.82s)]
*  For our most tricky disagreements, seeking the truth and seeking to convince others of the truth [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=955.82s)]
*  might not be the right place to start. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=963.82s)]
*  In fact, our reference for the truth might be a distraction that's getting in the way of finding common ground [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=966.82s)]
*  and getting things done. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=976.82s)]
*  We all have different truths. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=977.82s)]
*  They're based on things like where we come from, how we were raised and how other people perceive us. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=979.82s)]
*  Yeah, truth can be distracting. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=985.82s)]
*  Like when you're trying to stage a coup or push a hoax. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=988.82s)]
*  I agree. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=991.82s)]
*  The truth can get in the way of getting things done. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=992.82s)]
*  If you're a political animal, but not if you're reporting the news, truth should be here. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=995.82s)]
*  NPR takes our money and buries the truth. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1001.82s)]
*  How many times did you all interview Adam Schiff about the Russia collusion? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1005.82s)]
*  I'm sorry. Sorry. I don't have that number. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1009.82s)]
*  It was 25 times. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1011.82s)]
*  You know how many times NPR interviewed chairman of this committee, Oversight Committee, Jamie Comer [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1012.82s)]
*  about the Biden impeachment inquiry, the Hunter Biden tax evasion and illicit business dealings with the Biden family? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1017.82s)]
*  I'm sorry. Sorry. I don't know. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1022.82s)]
*  I believe that's zero. So it's 25 to zero. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1024.82s)]
*  For six months, there was an analysis done on PBS's NewsHour from June to November of 2023, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1026.82s)]
*  where they found that far right was that term was used 162 times and far left was only used six times. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1032.82s)]
*  Do you find that troubling? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1039.82s)]
*  I don't know the study that you're referring to, and I'd love to be very interested in seeing it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1041.82s)]
*  Adam Schiff had no evidence of Russia collusion and he was on NPR every day. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1046.82s)]
*  And they never even said, show me what you got, Adam. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1052.82s)]
*  Comer had bank records, photos, texts of the Biden clan shaking down foreign countries. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1055.82s)]
*  It was so bad, Biden had to pardon his son to keep him out of prison. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1061.82s)]
*  But NPR saw what Comer had and wouldn't book him. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1065.82s)]
*  October 2020, New York Post had the Hunter Biden laptop story. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1069.82s)]
*  And one of those editors, I guess one of those 87 Democrat editors, said this. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1074.82s)]
*  We don't want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1080.82s)]
*  We don't want to waste the listeners and readers' times on stories that are just pure distractions. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1083.82s)]
*  Was that a pure distraction story? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1088.82s)]
*  Our current editorial leadership believes that that was a mistake, as do I. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1090.82s)]
*  Yeah, the whole country knows that was a mistake. Definitely impacted the election. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1094.82s)]
*  NPR makes the same mistakes in the same direction again and again. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1098.82s)]
*  That's when you know it's not a mistake. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1102.82s)]
*  The government can't fund reporters who are trying to overthrow this government. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1105.82s)]
*  We have enough propaganda channels. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1110.82s)]
*  Why should taxpayers be on the hook for this one? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1112.82s)]
*  I like Sesame Street. I grew up on it. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1115.82s)]
*  I was Oscar the Grouch for Halloween. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1118.82s)]
*  And my daughter Gigi loves Elmo. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1120.82s)]
*  But around 99% of PBS and NPR's money comes from private donations. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1122.82s)]
*  So why can't these donors pony up 1% more? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1129.82s)]
*  Do they really need taxpayer money if they have billions pouring in from liberal benefactors? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1133.82s)]
*  The answer is of course not. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1138.82s)]
*  But Democrats don't want to save any taxpayer money. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1141.82s)]
*  They just want to run against Musk in the midterms. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1145.82s)]
*  It is the mindset of the Trump administration. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1148.82s)]
*  And that is that this government is to be run for a handful of billionaires and people with power. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1153.82s)]
*  And everyone else can just eat dirt. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1162.82s)]
*  We're feeling it everywhere that Elon Musk goes with his magic chainsaw to fire people to do it in ugly ways to undermine the kind of obligations we have passed here in Congress. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1165.82s)]
*  Democrats are fighting to fund Drag Queen Story Hour. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1180.82s)]
*  Mysterious Amazonian women. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1183.82s)]
*  Pregnancy prevention for boys. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1185.82s)]
*  But don't forget about DEI tomato seeds. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1189.82s)]
*  Behind a door at USDA, we found a whole box of these seeds. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1193.82s)]
*  These are specific tomato seeds that are for growing diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility at USDA. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1198.82s)]
*  I mean, look at these. If you can be anything, be inclusive at USDA. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1209.82s)]
*  From the radical left, they're now clinging to their one piece of manna from heaven. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1214.82s)]
*  A story about a high level White House group chat on the encrypted messaging app called Signal, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1219.82s)]
*  which is a complete joke coming from the very people who approve the app, the use of the app and intentionally leak materials to journalists all the time. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1226.82s)]
*  By the way, let me warn Democrats. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1235.82s)]
*  There is information that will be coming your way very soon to show what utter complete phony hypocrites that you are. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1238.82s)]
*  Just stay tuned. We're on we're on the case. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1246.82s)]
*  But we get it. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1249.82s)]
*  On the far left, Trump hating journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was somehow accidentally included on the group chat as cabinet level officials discussed possible military strikes in Yemen. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1250.82s)]
*  But let's be very clear. There was no classified material revealed in those texts. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1261.82s)]
*  Caroline Levitt made the proper distinction. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1265.82s)]
*  There is a difference between quote sensitive policy discussions and quote classified information. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1267.82s)]
*  Did the administration want Jeffrey Goldberg included on that high level group chat? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1274.82s)]
*  Of course not. It was an unfortunate, inadvertent, one off error to accidentally include a reporter on that text chain. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1279.82s)]
*  But as reported, steps have already been taken to prevent this from ever happening in the future. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1287.82s)]
*  But you've got to put things into perspective. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1293.82s)]
*  The mission in Yemen was operationally a complete success. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1295.82s)]
*  It can't get any more successful. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1300.82s)]
*  And as President Trump has been pointing out, the left's current bout of hysteria is ridiculous. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1302.82s)]
*  It's hypocritical. It's dishonest. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1307.82s)]
*  In other words, just a typical day for Democrats. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1310.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1312.82s)]
*  I think it's all a witch hunt. That's all. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1314.82s)]
*  I think it's a witch hunt. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1316.82s)]
*  I wasn't involved with it. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1318.82s)]
*  I don't. I wasn't there. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1320.82s)]
*  But I can tell you the result is unbelievable because the Houthis are looking to do something. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1321.82s)]
*  They want to know how do we stop? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1326.82s)]
*  How do we stop? How do we have peace? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1329.82s)]
*  The Houthis want peace because they're getting the hell knocked out of them. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1331.82s)]
*  It's been very, very strong. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1335.82s)]
*  The Houthis are dying for peace. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1337.82s)]
*  They don't want this. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1339.82s)]
*  And they're bad. Look, they were knocking ships out of the ocean. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1341.82s)]
*  You know, we had in the Suez Canal, they only have about 20 percent of the ships going through. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1344.82s)]
*  They have to go through a different way, which takes weeks of travel. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1348.82s)]
*  And that really affects commerce. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1353.82s)]
*  But the Houthis have been hit hard and they want to negotiate peace. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1355.82s)]
*  Why focus on the successful military operation when you can trash Donald Trump and people that work for him? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1360.82s)]
*  President Trump is right. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1366.82s)]
*  The Democratic Party, they're at it again with the legacy media, state-run media's help, of course, on X. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1367.82s)]
*  The Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, he described it this way. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1374.82s)]
*  It's actually perfect. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1377.82s)]
*  So let me get this straight. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1378.82s)]
*  The Atlantic released the so-called war plans, and those plans include no names, no targets, no locations, no units, no routes, no sources, no methods, no classified information. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1379.82s)]
*  Those are some really, wow, bleep war plans. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1391.82s)]
*  Hegseth continued, we will continue to do our job while the media does what it does best, pedal hoaxes. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1395.82s)]
*  And as per usual, like most other Democratic smears, this current obsession ultimately involve Russia and Vladimir Putin. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1401.82s)]
*  Look at the headline from CBS, quote, as top Trump aides sent text on Signal. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1409.82s)]
*  Flight data shows a member of the group chat was in Russia. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1415.82s)]
*  President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, who's been on this program many times, friend of the program. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1419.82s)]
*  He was in Russia negotiating peace with Vladimir Putin. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1425.82s)]
*  But guess what? He left his phone at home. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1430.82s)]
*  He brought a burner phone as was given to him by the government. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1433.82s)]
*  He didn't have access to the Signal group chat. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1438.82s)]
*  Whoopsie daisy, they got it wrong yet again. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1441.82s)]
*  Another fake phony controversy. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1444.82s)]
*  But some on the left are also taking this as an opportunity to go after everybody in the administration. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1447.82s)]
*  In the case of Witkoff, his job as a negotiator. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1452.82s)]
*  Even taking his comments about Hamas completely, utterly out of context. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1455.82s)]
*  Here is what Steve Witkoff actually said. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1460.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1463.82s)]
*  I thought we had a deal, an acceptable deal. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1464.82s)]
*  I even thought we had an approval from Hamas. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1468.82s)]
*  Maybe that's just me getting duped. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1471.82s)]
*  But I thought we were there. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1476.82s)]
*  And evidently we weren't. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1479.82s)]
*  So this is on Hamas. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1481.82s)]
*  The United States stands with the state of Israel. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1482.82s)]
*  That's a 100% commitment. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1485.82s)]
*  And we've expressed that. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1488.82s)]
*  Would we be amenable to a reach out from Hamas? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1490.82s)]
*  Of course we would be. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1494.82s)]
*  No different than in the Russian conflict. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1496.82s)]
*  We want to end the killing. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1498.82s)]
*  But we need to be clear who the aggressor is here. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1500.82s)]
*  And that is Hamas. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1504.82s)]
*  And then he went on to describe Hamas in another interview as nothing but a bunch of murdering terrorists. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1506.82s)]
*  Interesting how the media took that part out of it and slammed Hamas as a group of murdering terrorists. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1511.82s)]
*  Forget that part. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1518.82s)]
*  And if in the middle of trying to negotiate peace in Europe and the Middle East, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1520.82s)]
*  if God forbid Steve Witkoff doesn't scream at them, you're a murderer, you're a Nazi, you're a killer, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1525.82s)]
*  well they think he's not negotiating. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1532.82s)]
*  He happens to be a great negotiator. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1534.82s)]
*  And if he ever did something that stupid, there would be no negotiation and there'd never be a negotiated settlement. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1537.82s)]
*  How dumb are some of these people? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1544.82s)]
*  You go into a negotiation, call them a Nazi, you're a murderer, you're a thug. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1547.82s)]
*  Joe Biden never talked peace with Putin one time. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1553.82s)]
*  Now he called them a lot of names. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1556.82s)]
*  Putin didn't care. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1558.82s)]
*  He still went into Ukraine. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1559.82s)]
*  Joe spent hundreds of billions of your dollars. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1561.82s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1563.82s)]
*  Donald Trump is working for peace. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1564.82s)]
*  Steve Witkoff is working hard on a peace plan and making more progress in a few short weeks [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1566.82s)]
*  than anyone in the Biden White House achieved in four long years. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1571.82s)]
*  So make no mistake, the hysteria on the left is just feigned. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1575.82s)]
*  It is phony, moral outrage. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1579.82s)]
*  They don't really care about this issue. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1582.82s)]
*  If they did, they would have screamed bloody murder about the open borders that allowed in, oh, let's see, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1585.82s)]
*  terrorists, murderers, rapists, gang members, cartel members, all the people that Donald Trump is trying to kick out, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1591.82s)]
*  that they're trying to protect and allow to stay in. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1598.82s)]
*  This isn't Watergate. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1600.82s)]
*  This isn't Goldberg Gate. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1602.82s)]
*  It's certainly not Abbey Gate. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1603.82s)]
*  And it doesn't even begin to rise to the security risks presented by a president in full cognitive decline. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1605.82s)]
*  And everybody knew it. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1612.82s)]
*  And yet the legacy media mob, the Democratic Party, were not just unconcerned with the president's mental state [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1613.82s)]
*  because they knew what it was. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1620.82s)]
*  They just lied about it for years in an effort to cover it up. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1621.82s)]
*  Shall we remind you? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1625.82s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1626.82s)]
*  Start your tape right now because I'm about to tell you the truth and F you if you can't handle the truth. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1627.82s)]
*  This version of Biden intellectually, analytically is the best Biden ever. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1635.82s)]
*  President Biden has a photographic memory. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1644.82s)]
*  He is sharp, intensely probing and detail oriented and focused. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1646.82s)]
*  Joe Biden does have any concerns about his mental fitness, nor do I. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1652.82s)]
*  I've spent an incredible amount of time with Joe Biden. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1655.82s)]
*  That's just a fade that the other side is pushing. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1657.82s)]
*  He's he's he's fine. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1659.82s)]
*  All this right wing propaganda that his mental acuity is declined is wrong. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1661.82s)]
*  I think you all have called this the cheap fakes video. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1665.82s)]
*  And that's exactly what they are. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1668.82s)]
*  They are cheap fakes video. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1670.82s)]
*  They are done in bad faith. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1671.82s)]
*  It's very clearly a cognitive decline. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1672.82s)]
*  That's what I'm referring to. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1675.82s)]
*  It makes me uncomfortable. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1676.82s)]
*  You have you are no. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1678.82s)]
*  It's so amazing. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1679.82s)]
*  It's so amazing to me that and try and figure out an answer cognitive decline. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1681.82s)]
*  You're trying to tell me that what I was suggesting was I think that you were mocking his stutter. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1686.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think you were mocking his stutter. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1690.82s)]
*  Mocking his stutter. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1692.82s)]
*  No, it was obvious for anybody with eyes to see. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1695.82s)]
*  He was in a steep cognitive decline, which is a clear and present danger to the country. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1699.82s)]
*  Which as commander in chief is a threat to our nation, which they all knew about and they all lied about. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1704.82s)]
*  The same people also lied about the biggest preventable national security crisis in the history of our country. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1711.82s)]
*  That is Joe's wide open borders. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1719.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1721.82s)]
*  Our efforts to secure the border, southern border is working. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1722.82s)]
*  It is my testimony that the border is secure. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1725.82s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1729.82s)]
*  Our border is secure. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1730.82s)]
*  Sounds to most folks like a crisis. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1732.82s)]
*  Well, look, it's way down now. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1734.82s)]
*  We've now gotten control precisely that the border is closed. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1736.82s)]
*  Nor could I have been clearer and continued to be so, which is the border is closed. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1740.82s)]
*  You're confident this border secure. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1746.82s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and our administration. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1750.82s)]
*  We agree that the border is secure. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1759.82s)]
*  And now we're supposed to believe that those very people and the people in the state run legacy media mob actually care about national security for four long years. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1761.82s)]
*  They lied. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1772.82s)]
*  They covered up Biden's border crisis or challenge these lie. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1773.82s)]
*  They never challenged anything. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1777.82s)]
*  But now they want you to believe that their nonstop hysteria about an inadvertent one off text exchange surrounding a successful strike in Yemen without any details, without it being, you know, top secret is somehow genuine. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1779.82s)]
*  In reality, just another baseless political smear. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1796.82s)]
*  If it wasn't so serious, it actually is funny. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1799.82s)]
*  It's entertaining how pathetic they are from a party that is barely clinging to relevance at this point. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1802.82s)]
*  Living very comfortably in their 20 percent approval range. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1808.82s)]
*  And as per usual, this was followed by a lawsuit, a left wing group named American Oversight and now suing Trump officials for allegedly violating the Federal Records Act. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1811.82s)]
*  And what do you know it? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1821.82s)]
*  What a what a piece of good luck. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1823.82s)]
*  The very same Obama appointed judge who tried to block Trump's deportation flights to El Salvador mid air. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1825.82s)]
*  Turn around and come back. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1832.82s)]
*  We'll also oversee this lawsuit. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1834.82s)]
*  This messaging mess was like the aftermath of chugging prune juice on Taco Tuesday. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1836.82s)]
*  The results are not great, but not surprising either. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1841.82s)]
*  Since January 20th, so many great things have happened so fast. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1845.82s)]
*  The borders closed, fugitives have been caught, egg and gas prices have plummeted and Rosie O'Donnell moved to Ireland. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1850.82s)]
*  It's killing the media who hate all of it because Trump's doing it all. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1861.82s)]
*  They're not used to a president who moves with such speed. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1867.82s)]
*  They got spoiled by four years of a man who only left skid marks on his underwear. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1870.82s)]
*  So now they act like they really are drama crats, each one elbowing out the other for the spotlight. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1877.82s)]
*  Meanwhile, we have bigger fish to fry. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1884.82s)]
*  And when you have real goals, ones you decide to act on, you're going to make some mistakes, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1886.82s)]
*  whether it's rescuing astronauts in space, running for public office or delivering a baby at a restaurant [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1891.82s)]
*  because you told your date you were in medical school. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1897.82s)]
*  Because there are goals and ideals. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1902.82s)]
*  A goal is what you set out to achieve. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1905.82s)]
*  The ideal is the path and methods to achieve it. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1907.82s)]
*  Is your goal to kill terrorists? Great. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1910.82s)]
*  The ideal is to do it cleanly and decisively. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1913.82s)]
*  But it's called an ideal because perfection's unattainable. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1916.82s)]
*  But we accept that risk. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1920.82s)]
*  That's how winners live their lives. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1922.82s)]
*  You don't play, you don't win. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1924.82s)]
*  Getting things done is risky. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1926.82s)]
*  But you can avoid that risk by doing nothing. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1928.82s)]
*  And that's not Trump at all. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1930.82s)]
*  And Americans are okay with it, right, Harry? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1933.82s)]
*  I think sometimes it's important to do a little bit of reality check and take a little different spin at the numbers. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1936.82s)]
*  I'm going to do that right here because all we talk about is how unpopular Donald Trump is. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1941.82s)]
*  But in reality, he's basically more popular than he was at any point in term number one [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1945.82s)]
*  and more popular than he was when he won election back in November of 2024. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1950.82s)]
*  How about NBC News? 44%. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1955.82s)]
*  That's the highest since 2004. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1957.82s)]
*  The bottom line is the percentage of Americans who say we're on the right track is through the roof. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1960.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1964.82s)]
*  No wonder the media is feasting on the signal story like it's a gazelle carcass at The View. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1965.82s)]
*  What's left for them when everyone loves Trump's aims? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1975.82s)]
*  You go after the process. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1978.82s)]
*  Oh, it's too fast. It's too sloppy. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1980.82s)]
*  It's like they're describing my dream date with John Stamos. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1982.82s)]
*  But not with old Joe. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1988.82s)]
*  But not with old Joe. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1989.82s)]
*  There were thousands of errors Biden didn't make as he presided over one giant deliberate act of negligence. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1990.82s)]
*  It was all Joe could do to get out of bed in the morning. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1995.82s)]
*  If this guy put his shoes on the right feet two days in a row, the legacy media would have orgasms. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=1998.82s)]
*  I wonder if it's something that should have been done by sleepy Joe Biden. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2004.82s)]
*  This is something that should have been done by sleepy Joe Biden, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2009.82s)]
*  but it was asleep at the wheel other than when it came to stealing money, of course. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2012.82s)]
*  Amen. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2017.82s)]
*  Meanwhile, the same outraged media you see now were the very same who covered up Joe's mental decline. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2019.82s)]
*  Biden was an expert at not doing things. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2025.82s)]
*  He didn't close the border, which was too much to ask from a guy who refused to do the same thing with his bathrobe. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2028.82s)]
*  He didn't reduce crime or inflation. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2034.82s)]
*  Hell, he increased both. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2036.82s)]
*  He didn't get creepy men out of women's locker rooms. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2038.82s)]
*  Instead, he appointed them to high office. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2040.82s)]
*  Perhaps we were lucky he ignored so many problems. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2044.82s)]
*  I mean, look at the damage they did while doing absolutely nothing. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2047.82s)]
*  Can you imagine what the country would look like if they actually tried? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2050.8199999999997s)]
*  Instead of capturing terrorists or deporting gangs, Joe just shrugged his bony shoulders and said, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2054.8199999999997s)]
*  well, what can you do? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2059.8199999999997s)]
*  Before collapsing on the beach eight hours a day. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2061.8199999999997s)]
*  So for the next four years, you're going to hear about mistakes because Trump's aims are so dead on, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2064.8199999999997s)]
*  all the angry media has left is processed. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2070.82s)]
*  But you know better. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2073.82s)]
*  We dig a leader with great aim who'll take a risk on America's behalf. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2075.82s)]
*  Not a guy whose aim failed the country, but also the toilet. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2079.82s)]
*  This brook doesn't babble when fighting the radical rabble. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2089.82s)]
*  Human rights lawyer, Brooke Goldstein. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2093.82s)]
*  He used to do crack. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2095.82s)]
*  Now he looks like someone who used to do crack. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2100.82s)]
*  Comedian, Rich Voss. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2103.82s)]
*  She's toured with the band and read Ayn Rand. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2107.82s)]
*  Host of the Kennedy Saves the World podcast, Kennedy. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2111.82s)]
*  And like a game of bridge, old ladies like to do them once a week with friends. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2117.82s)]
*  And sometimes bestselling author, comedian and former NWA world champion, Tyrus. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2123.82s)]
*  Brooke, I made a decision today. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2132.82s)]
*  I gave this story 24 hours and I said, that's all you deserve. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2134.82s)]
*  This is all you deserve from a media that spent four years covering up incompetence and lack of security [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2137.82s)]
*  to then lecture us that there's a breach in security and there's incompetence. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2143.82s)]
*  F*** them. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2147.82s)]
*  Well said, well said. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2149.82s)]
*  But we both know that this is going to drag on and on. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2151.82s)]
*  Because that's all they have, like you said in your intro. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2154.82s)]
*  Obviously, this is not good. Is it being blown out of proportion? Absolutely. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2157.82s)]
*  Is this an example of a narcissistic journalist putting himself at the center of the story? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2161.82s)]
*  Absolutely, because there would be no security breach if he had done the right thing. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2167.82s)]
*  If you see yourself, you're on the wrong thread, you should point itself out, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2173.82s)]
*  you should flag it and take yourself off. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2177.82s)]
*  And he claims to care about national security, but instead he puts himself at the center of the story [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2179.82s)]
*  and he blows it out of proportion and risks our national security by publishing the thread. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2184.82s)]
*  To me, it is so obvious that it's a diversion from what we all have to be doing, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2189.82s)]
*  which is thanking President Trump for making the Middle East more peaceful and safer. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2193.82s)]
*  We are not able to have any of our shipping ships through the Suez Canal or the Red Sea for over two years. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2198.82s)]
*  That is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that the Houthis were taken off the terror list. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2205.82s)]
*  Trump carried out an excellent attack, carried out the mission to perfection, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2210.82s)]
*  and that's what we should be talking about right now. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2217.82s)]
*  It's funny, Rich, what you're wearing. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2219.82s)]
*  Have you ever used the Signal app to chat with your bookie? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2222.82s)]
*  No, here's the thing. I'm on the run right now. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2229.82s)]
*  Doesn't Biden look like Fire Marshal Bill in that picture? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2234.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2239.82s)]
*  So I don't like to group chat, any of that, because I don't want to apologize to more than one person. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2240.82s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2252.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2253.82s)]
*  I don't want to screw up. I, by accident, sent my mom nude pictures. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2254.82s)]
*  Thankfully, she's been dead for 10 years, so she didn't get them. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2259.82s)]
*  Both were stiff. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2265.82s)]
*  Ew. Jesus, Craig. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2267.82s)]
*  Wait, did I embarrass you? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2275.82s)]
*  Which is hard to do as long as I've been on this show, but calling him stiff and his mama stiff is fighting where I'm from. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2278.82s)]
*  I'm just saying. Talking with my mama, I've got to cut you. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2288.82s)]
*  But it's a lie. I'm not stiff. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2293.82s)]
*  Kennedy, this is a family show. I wanted to remind you. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2303.82s)]
*  And I'm someone's mom, and I can say Rich is not stiff by checking the green room. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2308.82s)]
*  Part of the HR protocol. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2314.82s)]
*  How can we even, okay, let's even take Goldberg. He's the boy who cried wolf. Two hoaxes. The Russian hoax, the Losers hoax about Trump saying things. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2316.82s)]
*  So why do we have to listen to any of these people? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2328.82s)]
*  Because he's desperate for clicks. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2331.82s)]
*  The only thing he is doing here is trying to raise the profile of the Atlantic. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2332.82s)]
*  And he thinks, you know, I was talking to my domestic partner today. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2338.82s)]
*  Oh, what's her name? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2342.82s)]
*  Patty. Thank you. So Patty and I were talking. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2344.82s)]
*  It's a male, but my brother says that whenever I say domestic partner, I sound like a lesbian, which is fine. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2348.82s)]
*  I'm an ally and I don't judge. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2353.82s)]
*  And those are lesbian glasses, by the way. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2355.82s)]
*  Do you know how many times a week I get called sir? At this point I've just given up. If I don't get misgendered. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2359.82s)]
*  I can't tell if you look like Rachel Maddow or Chris Hayes or their bastard love child. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2366.82s)]
*  That actually would make everyone soft just thinking about the cougars. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2372.82s)]
*  Yep. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2377.82s)]
*  What were you saying? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2382.82s)]
*  What the hell were we talking about? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2383.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2385.82s)]
*  I was hoping it was Goldberg the wrestler. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2386.82s)]
*  I was hoping it was Jeffrey Toobin. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2388.82s)]
*  At least it would make the story a little bit more exciting. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2391.82s)]
*  But Chris Hayes is such a doughy knob. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2394.82s)]
*  And from saying this is the greatest security breach of our lifetime. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2398.82s)]
*  It's like, what? You don't remember Afghanistan? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2402.82s)]
*  Like you don't remember 9-11? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2406.82s)]
*  That is so disingenuous. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2408.82s)]
*  He needs an ocemic and a brain transplant. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2410.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2413.82s)]
*  Tyrus. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2417.82s)]
*  When you look at that montage you realize that they're desperate. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2420.82s)]
*  And they're pathetic and we get it. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2423.82s)]
*  But God they're just...I'm trying to cut back on the F words. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2426.82s)]
*  I just can't...I'm with you. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2430.82s)]
*  They...f*** man. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2436.82s)]
*  He's so...is it Goldberg? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2440.82s)]
*  Yeah, Goldberg. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2442.82s)]
*  That's the one. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2444.82s)]
*  He's so stupid. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2445.82s)]
*  You had an inside track. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2447.82s)]
*  You could have been the greatest war correspondent ever. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2450.82s)]
*  Just shut up, wait until it's over, give critiques. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2454.82s)]
*  But he had an inside track. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2457.82s)]
*  He was literally to catch a Republican. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2459.82s)]
*  He had the TV show set up and he was like, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2462.82s)]
*  You set up the whole Ketchup Predator. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2466.82s)]
*  The guy comes in like, sir, what are you doing? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2468.82s)]
*  Are you here to see the 13-year-old boy? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2470.82s)]
*  No, I'm his father, I live here. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2472.82s)]
*  All right, get the camera crew in the van, let's go. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2474.82s)]
*  He blew his wad on a no story. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2478.82s)]
*  The only thing that would make that stuff better was that at the end, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2481.82s)]
*  Pete started asking everyone where they're going to eat lunch. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2484.82s)]
*  But I wonder, I just wonder, maybe it'll be by the end of the day. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2487.82s)]
*  When they decide this was worse than January 6. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2492.82s)]
*  That will be their next move. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2496.82s)]
*  Again, Will Cain on the Will Cain show destroyed them today. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2500.82s)]
*  If you want the most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RFm3_pGnI&t=2521.82s)]
