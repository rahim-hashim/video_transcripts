# Fox News Highlights - Oct. 23, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c)
*  The Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=0.0s)]
*  As always, thank you for spending some time with us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2.08s)]
*  13 days out, and while top polls show the race is extremely tight [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=5.28s)]
*  and very difficult to predict, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  there are some undeniable trend lines in Trump's favor. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=11.76s)]
*  Now, even as Harris has a massive money advantage, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=15.72s)]
*  we see this from The Economist. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump takes the lead as polls swing away from Kamala Harris. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Now, Harris has dropped 10 points in the survey from just a week ago, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  and Trump, he surged by 10 on the other side. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=29.4s)]
*  And Harris is only up in two swing states, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=33.16s)]
*  Michigan and Nevada, according to Bloomberg. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=36.72s)]
*  Trump leads in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=39.28s)]
*  Arizona and North Carolina. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=42.24s)]
*  And last night, for a moment, it seemed even Obama was feeling it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=45.24s)]
*  I notice my palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=49.92s)]
*  Heavy? I'm not sure what heavy means, but whatever. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=57.0s)]
*  Of course, like I said, conservatives shouldn't count their chickens. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  This is still anyone's race. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=63.6s)]
*  Remember what happened in 2022. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=65.04s)]
*  A lot of people were disappointed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=67.2s)]
*  But that doesn't stop Republicans from having a little fun in their minds, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=69.2s)]
*  from dreaming of what they saw eight years ago. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=72.6s)]
*  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=75.4s)]
*  President Obama. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  Can we find her? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=80.04s)]
*  I'd like to interview her tonight, if possible. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=82.04s)]
*  Now, as close as things are, Democrats may be running out of cards to play. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=85.04s)]
*  The best they can hope for is that maybe they can juice the female turnout [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=89.04s)]
*  enough to overcome their deficit with other demographic groups, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=94.04s)]
*  like male voters, Hispanics, black men and young people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=97.04s)]
*  And to that I say, Kamala's bad for women. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=101.04s)]
*  Well, none of it really seems to be sticking. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=106.04s)]
*  They tried, Trump's a dictator in waiting. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=109.04s)]
*  They even compared him to Adolf Hitler. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=112.04s)]
*  Didn't really work. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=115.04s)]
*  He's going to unleash the Pentagon on us. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=117.04s)]
*  He is out for unchecked power. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=120.04s)]
*  That's what he's looking for. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=123.04s)]
*  He wants to send the military after him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=125.04s)]
*  He wants to send the military after him. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  That's what he's looking for. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=131.04s)]
*  He wants to send the military after American citizens. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=133.04s)]
*  The audience was like, what? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=137.04s)]
*  None of it's landing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=139.04s)]
*  But they keep going negative. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=141.04s)]
*  Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=143.04s)]
*  and will stop at nothing to claim unchecked power for himself. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=150.04s)]
*  And yet the lower she sunk with her attacks, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=156.04s)]
*  well, the lower she sunk in the polls. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=159.04s)]
*  So now what? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=162.04s)]
*  Well, now she's turning the page on joy and love [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=163.04s)]
*  to a new chapter of fear and loathing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=166.04s)]
*  So from now until election day, Kamala's crew will spend their time [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=170.04s)]
*  and a lot of money scaring and lying to women in order to increase turnout. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=173.04s)]
*  Now, although this strategy may be your only hope, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=178.04s)]
*  given some of the trends I mentioned earlier, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=181.04s)]
*  it's not in the least inspiring, nor is it optimistic. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=183.04s)]
*  It's not what we thought we were getting with Kamala Harris. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=187.04s)]
*  It's just plain cynical. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=190.04s)]
*  And coming from Governor Gugliel's, it's plain comical. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=192.04s)]
*  Think about all of the women in your life who you love, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=195.04s)]
*  daughters, wives, moms, cousins, your neighbors, whatever. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=199.04s)]
*  This election is literally about their lives. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=203.04s)]
*  Literally. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=208.04s)]
*  Well, the media also got their marching orders. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=209.04s)]
*  Women be afraid, be very afraid. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=212.04s)]
*  If there weren't men like Donald Trump in the world, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=215.04s)]
*  women actually wouldn't require protection. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=218.04s)]
*  The difference could not be more stark relating to women's reproductive rights. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=220.04s)]
*  Oh, Mitch. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=224.04s)]
*  Now, the most bizarre aspect of their supercharged fear campaign [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=226.04s)]
*  targeting women voters is Kamala's decision [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=230.04s)]
*  to involve a former congresswoman with zero following. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=233.04s)]
*  I was just with one of the leaders, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=238.04s)]
*  and I think opinion leaders in the Republican Party, Liz Cheney. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=241.04s)]
*  She is pro-life. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=245.04s)]
*  But she also understands the pain and the tragedy that has happened [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=247.04s)]
*  since Donald Trump allowed Roe v. Wade to be overturned. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=252.04s)]
*  What tragedy is she talking about? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=256.03999999999996s)]
*  And she's not an opinion leader of the Republican Party, thank you very much. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  What, the tragedy of more babies being born in states like Alabama, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  Mississippi, Louisiana? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  This is what the Democrat Party has become? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=269.04s)]
*  Where the right to abort one's offspring until birth [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=272.04s)]
*  is now their central, defining, sacrosanct organizing tenet? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=276.04s)]
*  Their dogma? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=282.04s)]
*  But women, don't fall for it, regardless of where you are on that issue, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=284.04s)]
*  because Harris herself is responsible for bringing the tragedy to America. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=288.04s)]
*  Economic suffering with inflation, meaning young families, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=293.04s)]
*  young women struggle to buy homes and afford basic necessities. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=297.04s)]
*  The cost of groceries and gasoline and everything going so high. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=301.04s)]
*  We live in a fairly rural area. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=305.04s)]
*  It's the prices that get us. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=308.04s)]
*  I could not afford daycare. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=309.04s)]
*  I tried applying for any kind of assistance and was denied. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=311.04s)]
*  You're like, are you going to eat this week, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=315.04s)]
*  or are you going to save money to pay rent? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=317.04s)]
*  It's a heartbreak. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=319.04s)]
*  And then there's the tragedy of Kamala's open borders. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=321.04s)]
*  Vicious, brutal crimes committed by illegals against women and girls primarily. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=325.04s)]
*  Human trafficking, child sex trafficking. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=332.04s)]
*  We're never going to know the actual number of victims involved, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=335.04s)]
*  but their cries go unanswered in the Harris campaign. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=339.04s)]
*  Which is why Tim Walz's words are just not believable. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=343.04s)]
*  She has had one client, the people. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=346.04s)]
*  She stood up for women and children against predators and abusers. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=350.04s)]
*  She stood up for families and communities against transnational gangs and traffickers. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=354.04s)]
*  Traffickers, there we are. What a joke. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=359.04s)]
*  The cartels and the traffickers have been one of the few growth industries under Biden and Harris. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=361.04s)]
*  And when pressed, Kamala Harris will not apologize for the suffering that her open border has wrought. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=367.04s)]
*  Jocelyn Nungeri, Rachel Moran, Lakin Riley. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=375.04s)]
*  They are young women who were brutally assaulted and killed by some of the men who were released at the beginning of the administration. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=379.04s)]
*  Do you owe those families an apology? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=386.04s)]
*  Let me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=390.04s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=394.04s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=396.04s)]
*  You know what I call that? Tragic cases. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=400.04s)]
*  You know, the feigned concern. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=403.04s)]
*  That's camera ready compassion. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=406.04s)]
*  It's totally phony. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=409.04s)]
*  And women voters are also mothers. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=411.04s)]
*  And no mother wants to see her son or her daughter get needlessly killed because of an administration's incompetence. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=413.04s)]
*  Afghanistan was another Biden-Harris tragedy. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=421.04s)]
*  And with Liz Cheney said to be Secretary of Defense in a Harris administration, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=425.04s)]
*  moms should prepare for more of their sons and daughters to go off to war. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=429.04s)]
*  Because that will be on the agenda and maybe even a draft if things get really bad. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=433.04s)]
*  And how is this any of this good for women again? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=439.04s)]
*  Women across America, none of the people you're seeing on TV, you're listening to on podcasts, really believe that Trump is dangerous. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=443.04s)]
*  You saw Chuck Schumer hanging out at the Alice Smith dinner with Trump. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=452.04s)]
*  He thinks Trump's Hitler. I don't think so. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=456.04s)]
*  And if Trump wins on January 20th, 2025 and he goes into the White House, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=459.04s)]
*  well, every single member of MSNBC will be back on the air to attack him. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=464.04s)]
*  Joe Biden will be at the inaugural if he can find it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=470.04s)]
*  So will Kamala Harris. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=473.04s)]
*  No high profile celebrities, I'm sorry, will be selling their belongings and moving to Europe. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=475.04s)]
*  Liberals will not go into hiding. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=481.04s)]
*  It is all a lie and they know it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=483.04s)]
*  And smart and savvy women are too cool and too with it to fall for any of this. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=486.04s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=493.04s)]
*  The clock is ticking on Kamala Harris. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=494.04s)]
*  Less than two weeks until Election Day, Democrats are getting prickly about her campaign. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=497.04s)]
*  Politico says she's running on yesterday and Trump rather than tomorrow and her. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=502.04s)]
*  Kamala still hasn't been able to answer the easiest question. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=507.04s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=511.04s)]
*  She can't tell us because one mistake game over. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=512.04s)]
*  The election is that close. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=516.04s)]
*  Holy cow. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=518.04s)]
*  From a historical perspective, we are heading into the election with the closest polls in the electoral college that we have ever seen, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=521.04s)]
*  at least over the last 50 years. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=528.04s)]
*  Real clear says the race is too close to call. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=530.04s)]
*  It's the tightest race in over half a century. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=533.04s)]
*  And the only campaign event Kamala's done in the last 48 hours. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=536.04s)]
*  She stopped at a deli. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=540.04s)]
*  Look at the smoke. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=542.04s)]
*  I'm definitely. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=544.04s)]
*  Pastrami on rye and a slice of German chocolate cake. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=549.04s)]
*  Democrats are telling each other if this is a vibe election, the current vibes ain't great. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=553.04s)]
*  And now people are starting to cry. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=559.04s)]
*  As I said, people very emotional today and. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=562.04s)]
*  A lot of tension in Democratic land because they're behaving as if they're losing. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=566.04s)]
*  I'm just telling you that's the view of Democrats to not just the media, not just Republicans. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=573.04s)]
*  Trump's in Georgia tonight with country star Jason Aldean, Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Junior and Tucker. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=578.04s)]
*  We're expecting some pyrotechnics tonight. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=585.04s)]
*  We'll take you there later, so stay tuned. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=588.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats are still in the getting to know her phase. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=590.04s)]
*  Kamala wants America to know she's friends with Liz Cheney. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=594.04s)]
*  And the left doesn't like that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=598.04s)]
*  The Cheney thing. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=601.04s)]
*  Do we really have to do that? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=603.04s)]
*  Look, I think it goes broader than that. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=606.04s)]
*  Look, Bernie Sanders, Dick Cheney, Taylor Swift, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=609.04s)]
*  Having the Cheneys on board. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=615.04s)]
*  You can't. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=617.04s)]
*  Dick Cheney or Taylor Swift. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=618.04s)]
*  No. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=620.04s)]
*  What country did Taylor Swift get us to invade? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=623.04s)]
*  It doesn't mean they agree with us. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=627.04s)]
*  We're not going to take their foreign policy decisions and discussions, you know, and implement those. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=629.04s)]
*  We're going to take their promise. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=633.04s)]
*  Yes, promise. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=635.04s)]
*  She sat down with Telemundo and she looked two faced. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=637.04s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=641.04s)]
*  Right now we're talking about border security and there's nobody, no Democrat talking about pathway to citizenship [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=642.04s)]
*  and immigration relief and the benefits that migrants bring to this country. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=648.04s)]
*  Oh, but there's no question that migrants bring. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=653.04s)]
*  America is a country that was built in part by immigrants who have come. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=659.04s)]
*  People are concerned about their TPS, third DACA there. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=665.04s)]
*  We're talking about mass deportations. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=669.04s)]
*  I'm not talking about anything other. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=673.04s)]
*  What do you stand on? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=675.04s)]
*  What's your stand there? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=676.04s)]
*  We need smart, humane immigration policy in America that includes a pathway to citizenship. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=679.04s)]
*  So she went from tough girl touring the border with agents to mass amnesty. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=689.04s)]
*  Telemundo had to interrupt her almost as much as Bret Baer. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=696.04s)]
*  Paul suggests that you're having shortcomings with Latinos, specifically with Latino men. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=700.04s)]
*  Why do you think that President Donald Trump has been able to to make those gains with Latinos? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=705.04s)]
*  Listen, Donald Trump has when he was president had policies that I think have been very harmful to working people. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=713.04s)]
*  You know, he gave tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=723.04s)]
*  He will do that again without. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=727.04s)]
*  But why is he winning with Latino voters? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=730.04s)]
*  Not winning, not winning, but, you know, winning more voters. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=732.04s)]
*  But this is not my experience. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=736.04s)]
*  My experience is I talk with Latino voters every day all the time. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=738.04s)]
*  And there is an incredible amount of support there. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=744.04s)]
*  Reporters are getting testy with Harris. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=747.04s)]
*  NBC asked her about taxpayer funded sex changes three times. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=749.04s)]
*  Still couldn't get an answer. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=754.04s)]
*  Do you believe that transgender Americans should have access to gender affirming care in this country? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=756.04s)]
*  I believe we should follow the law. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=761.04s)]
*  I mean, I think you're probably pointing to the fact that Donald Trump's campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=763.04s)]
*  They're trying to define you on this. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=769.04s)]
*  I'm asking you to define yourself, though. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=771.04s)]
*  I believe that that people as the law states, even on this issue about federal law, that that is a decision that doctors will make in terms of what is medically necessary. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=773.04s)]
*  I will move on, but I don't know that I heard a clear answer from you on the issue of gender affirming care. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=783.04s)]
*  What do you want the LGBTQ plus community to know as they're looking for a full throated backing from you for trans for trans Americans? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=787.04s)]
*  I believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=795.04s)]
*  Period. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=801.04s)]
*  Kamala just does what she's told, but she can't say that. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=803.04s)]
*  So every answer is as painful for her as it is for you and me. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=807.04s)]
*  And if she doesn't know where she's going, how is she going to take us with her? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=811.04s)]
*  His plans will weaken America's economy. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=817.04s)]
*  Why do you think that's not landing with voters? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=819.04s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=821.04s)]
*  Former President Trump leads you on this issue. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=823.04s)]
*  Well, when I'm out, this is why I'm going out to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and and and Michigan, Michigan, excuse me. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=825.04s)]
*  Just got in late this morning, actually. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=833.04s)]
*  Kamala is calling Trump tired and unfit, but hasn't held a campaign event in two days and can't remember Michigan. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=835.04s)]
*  Thankfully, the voters know a lot more about Kamala than she does about us. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=841.04s)]
*  What are your feelings? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=845.04s)]
*  And let me start with the women here about Kamala Harris. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=847.04s)]
*  I don't think that she has the personality. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=849.04s)]
*  I don't think that she has what it takes to go up against Putin and go up against these other presidents that are built for this. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=851.04s)]
*  She don't understand our struggles. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=861.04s)]
*  And for me to believe you for another four years, you're crazy. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=863.04s)]
*  Like you're crazy. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=867.04s)]
*  You're saying the same thing that you said four years ago. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=869.04s)]
*  Trump talks about this a lot. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=871.04s)]
*  He says, you know, Kamala Harris became black when it was convenient. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=873.04s)]
*  Do you agree with him on that? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=877.04s)]
*  Do you feel like she's wearing her blackness? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=879.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=881.04s)]
*  She swore into the Senate. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=883.04s)]
*  It was as the first Indian American. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=885.04s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=887.04s)]
*  We don't care. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=889.04s)]
*  We all know she's not black. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=891.04s)]
*  Let's understand that. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=893.04s)]
*  We are all clear of that. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=895.04s)]
*  But my point of view, and like I told you earlier, she's already been there. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=897.04s)]
*  She's in office right now. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=899.04s)]
*  Shouldn't black women in Philly be ride or die? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=901.04s)]
*  That should be your base. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=903.04s)]
*  MSNBC was trying to cherry pick and they still couldn't find any love for Harris. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=905.04s)]
*  It's gotten so crazy that Barack Obama is now saying Trump's too old. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=907.04s)]
*  I'm going to vote, which means you're going to let a bunch of old people decide your future. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=909.04s)]
*  You wouldn't do that about your music. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=911.04s)]
*  You wouldn't do that about your clothes. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=913.04s)]
*  But you're going to let them decide what your future, your potential careers, what the environment's going to look like. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=915.04s)]
*  You're going to let them decide that. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=917.04s)]
*  And you're not going to let them decide that. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=919.04s)]
*  You're going to let them decide that. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=921.04s)]
*  And you're not going to let them decide that. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=923.04s)]
*  You're going to let them decide that. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=925.04s)]
*  And you're not going to let them decide that. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=927.04s)]
*  And you're not going to let them decide that. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=929.04s)]
*  And you're not going to let them decide that. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=931.04s)]
*  And you're not going to let them decide that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=933.04s)]
*  And you're not going to let them decide that. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=935.04s)]
*  You're going to let them decide that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=937.04s)]
*  And you're not going to let them decide that. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=939.04s)]
*  You're just going to opt out. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=941.04s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=943.04s)]
*  Barry with the gray hair telling black men not to listen to boomers. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=945.04s)]
*  It's kind of funny after he made us listen to Joe Biden for four years. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=947.04s)]
*  The oldest president of all time. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=949.04s)]
*  Black men are still sore over the last lecture. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=951.04s)]
*  I was deeply offended. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=953.04s)]

*  And the general tone of it was disgusting. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=973.04s)]
*  It was abhorrent. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=975.04s)]
*  I don't respect it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=977.04s)]
*  I didn't like nothing about it. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=979.04s)]

*  Okay. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=991.04s)]
*  don't think we should have fought fair against the Germans and the Japanese. I think we should have like snuck around them. And I [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=993.04s)]
*  think we should have, you know, gone behind him in the lines and cut their throats because that was what it was at stake. I [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=998.68s)]
*  think we're literally approaching the same place right now. I'm not talking about everybody. Stop. Don't think I'm not [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1005.12s)]

*  calling him Hitler saying it's time to slit throats. So it means it's time for the left's biggest hoax chef Jeffrey Goldberg at [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1021.22s)]
*  the Atlantic has cooked up a doozy says Trump admired Hitler. There's no recordings of this and everyone says it's baloney. But [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1033.94s)]
*  the VP who swallows hoaxes to go with their word salads ran to the cameras. It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1042.26s)]
*  That Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler the man who is responsible for the deaths of six million Jews and hundreds of [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1051.7s)]
*  thousands of Americans. Donald Trump is someone who I quote certainly falls into the general definition of fascist who in fact [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1062.46s)]
*  vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia. She was quoting Kelly there. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1072.02s)]
*  Kamala is asking for trouble. She knows the Secret Service can barely protect 45. She's playing with fire. She knows it. And so [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1080.7s)]
*  is the White House. So just to be clear when you said we do agree. President Biden believes that Donald Trump is a fascist. I mean [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1091.34s)]
*  yes. We have said he said himself the former president has said he is going to be a dictator on day one. We cannot ignore [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1099.4199999999998s)]
*  that. We go in 24 hours. The highest levels of the Democrat establishment have called Trump a Nazi who should be locked up and [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1107.78s)]
*  have his throat slit. If Donald Trump wins how are we going to have a peaceful transition. The left is saying Trump's a [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1115.02s)]
*  dictator who's going to turn the military on them. They're just going to hand him the keys to the White House and pretend like [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1123.6200000000001s)]
*  he's Mitt Romney. They're not just smearing Trump. They're saying half the country's Hitler. Listen it doesn't so much matter [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1128.74s)]
*  that Donald Trump is selling fascism. What really matters is that roughly half of Americans including a clear majority of [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1137.06s)]
*  American men are buying it. The average American man is saying yes to fascism right now. Why. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1144.74s)]
*  In the last week they've said American men are sexist fascists whose only chance of getting lucky in bed as if they vote for [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1152.34s)]
*  Kamala. They're admitting they have Trump derangement syndrome. I'm an optimistic person. I'm not hysterical. I laugh when [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1159.74s)]
*  people say oh you've got Trump derangement syndrome. If you're a reasonable person you should have Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1168.9s)]
*  Rules for men. Jimmy listen closely. Men should never let another person make them irrationally emotional. You don't give [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1177.18s)]
*  someone else power over you. Deep breath Jimmy. Stoicism. I'll send you a book. Welcome to Hannity. And tonight Kamala Harris is [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1184.74s)]
*  calling for amnesty straight up telling Telemundo that the millions of unvetted Harris Biden illegal immigrants the ones she allowed [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1194.06s)]
*  into the country should have a pathway to citizenship. Let's take a look. Right now we're talking about border security and there's [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1202.7s)]
*  nobody no Democrat talking about pathway to citizenship and immigration relief and that benefits that migrants bring to this country. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1210.38s)]
*  But there is no question that migrants bring. America is a country that was built in part by immigrants. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1220.2600000000002s)]
*  Forget about respecting laws border sovereignty. And I'm sure that if Democrats offer people something of such incredible great value I'm sure [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1231.22s)]
*  that they're hoping that the recipients of such generosity will be forever grateful. And those that give something so amazing. Anyway [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1241.66s)]
*  we're going to play more of her disastrous Telemundo interview that straight ahead tonight and later we're going to bring you new details [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1251.98s)]
*  from Missouri where a Democratic Senate candidate accidentally well wounded a local journalist with shrapnel during a reckless photo op at a [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1258.62s)]
*  makeshift shooting range. The Missouri Democrat called it quote a great day at the range with my friend Adam Kinzinger. But first early [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1268.22s)]
*  voting is now underway in almost every state. You could say every day for the next 13 days if there's voting going on it is Election Day. So [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1275.8999999999999s)]
*  get to the polls. Take nothing for granted. The margins they are razor thin. The Red Wave never materialized in twenty twenty two. There [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1284.46s)]
*  is not one person. Let me be very clear about this. In this country today with any degree of certainty that can tell you who is going to win [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1294.22s)]
*  this election. And if you care about your country and the future direction of this country my humble advice especially if you live in [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1304.42s)]
*  Georgia North Carolina Pennsylvania Wisconsin Michigan Arizona Nevada is to assume that your vote will determine the outcome of this [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1312.46s)]
*  election. I hope everybody will look at it as that important. Now for the second straight day no rallies for Kamala Harris instead she was [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1320.94s)]
*  in the Washington swamp using her vice presidential podium. Shocking to smear Donald Trump. Now Kamala's once self proclaimed joyful [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1328.74s)]
*  campaign. Yeah they have now reverted back to the same tired old tactics that we always see from Democrats in election years and it's [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1338.5s)]
*  almost like a permanent cycle. And that is smear slander besmirchment lying. Oh and have supporters comparing Donald Trump to Hitler and [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1346.5s)]
*  to Stalin and to Mussolini. And of course he's racist. Today Harris herself used a years old un well corroborated bogus accusation from a [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1355.94s)]
*  former disgruntled chief of staff to compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Take a look. It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1366.18s)]
*  Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler the man who is responsible for the deaths of six million Jews and hundreds of thousands of [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1375.3400000000001s)]
*  Americans. All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is. This is a window into who Donald Trump [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1386.86s)]
*  really is. In May of 2018 that same person was praising Donald Trump on NPR. Unfortunately Kamala gets zero points for creativity. Take a look at [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1398.3799999999999s)]
*  Let's have a little history lesson lesson a Hannity history lesson in 2008. Democrats they compared John McCain to Hitler. Four years later [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1410.7800000000002s)]
*  Democratic strategist David Axelrod. He works at fake news CNN. He compared Mitt Romney to Hitler. Nikki Haley was compared to Hitler's [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1418.74s)]
*  girlfriend Ava Braun. And we could go on and on and on. It's a time honored tradition of Democrats comparing comparing Republicans to [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1427.94s)]
*  Nazis is a tradition in the Democratic Party. When you have nothing else to run on. This is what you are left with. In fact just last week [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1437.02s)]
*  the Atlantic actually compared Trump Trump to Hitler Stalin and Mussolini the unholy trinity of evil dictators. Right. But remember Donald Trump [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1446.5s)]
*  was president for four years. He started no new wars. He signed a historic peace deal in the Middle East. He lowered your taxes. He cut [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1457.02s)]
*  regulation. He signed criminal justice reform. He secured our border. Not exactly the record of an evil warmongering lover of Adolf [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1464.78s)]
*  Hitler and a madman. And needless to say the melodramatic comparisons to Hitler they are falling flat and they're all predictable and it's not [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1474.14s)]
*  going to stop there. So buckle up. It'll be an emotional roller coaster ride. The Democrats their allies and the state run media mob. They [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1483.82s)]
*  will be trying every day the tactic of a slander smear. We just found out after 10 years Donald Trump did this and that and just just buckle [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1492.06s)]
*  up because you know it's coming. Kamala Harris cannot run on her terrible record or her far left radical and extreme beliefs. So smearing [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1501.62s)]
*  Donald Trump and calling him names and frankly those that support him calling them names is pretty much the only two left in their [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1512.22s)]
*  political toolbox. But per usual Barack Obama is so perplexed he's bewildered about how American politics have become so bitter. You know he did [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1519.6599999999999s)]
*  once talk about bitter people that cling to their God guns Bibles and religion to take a look as frustrating as politics can be [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1530.26s)]
*  sometimes. And I know it can be frustrating. Look I do not watch cable news. I really don't. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1538.34s)]
*  There are times where I just I don't understand how we got so toxic and just so divided and so bitter. And I get why sometimes people just [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1547.98s)]
*  don't want to pay attention to it. Really Barack. Let's do ourselves a favor. Let's take a little walk down memory lane. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1559.6999999999998s)]
*  Maybe we can refresh your memory. Maybe somebody will show this to you considering you don't watch cable news although you mentioned me [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1567.94s)]
*  about 10 or 15 times when you were running for president. Take a look. I'll put I'll put Mr. Burgess up against Sean Hannity. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1575.7s)]
*  He'll tear him up. If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers before you are president you will accept their support after your [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1582.9s)]
*  president. You got their plan which is let's have dirtier air dirtier water. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1596.74s)]
*  Less people with health insurance. I don't want to quell anger. I think people are right to be angry. I'm angry. I need you to go out [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1604.26s)]
*  and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors. I want you to talk to them whether they're independent or whether they are [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1611.82s)]
*  Republican. I want you to argue with them and get in their face. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1619.18s)]
*  Argue with them get in their face. I have no idea how politics has gotten this way. Every two every four years the same playbook from [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1625.82s)]
*  the Democrats. Well now the smears are worse than ever. They're in a panic. At this point they just hate Donald Trump. Hate his supporters [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1634.3s)]
*  so much it seems there is nothing that they won't do or they won't say. So buckle up. It's only going to get worse. Most Americans they [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1642.62s)]
*  simply want the price of every item they buy in every store they go to to come down. They want to pay less for a gallon of gasoline. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1652.46s)]
*  They would like a secure border so people from 180 countries in our and countries would terrorize and known terrorists and and murderers [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1662.1799999999998s)]
*  and rapists and violent criminals and gangs and cartels don't come into our country. They want less crime. They want a world of peace. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1671.62s)]
*  But the best the Democrat Democratic Party the best Kamala Harris can do is offer a more anti Trump hysteria. That is their favorite go to. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1679.9799999999998s)]
*  That includes former comedian turned emotional Democratic sycophant Jimmy Kimmel. Take a look. I'm an optimistic person. I'm not [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1689.6599999999999s)]
*  hysterical. I laugh when people say oh you've got Trump derangement syndrome. If you're a reasonable person you should have Trump [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1698.6599999999999s)]
*  derangement syndrome. And by the way I think he has derangement syndrome about us too. The fact of the matter is this is a dangerous person. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1706.8999999999999s)]
*  No matter no wonder nobody watches the show and Greg Gutfeld keeps kicking his ass. Anyway speaking of Trump derangement syndrome [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1715.1s)]
*  poor Democratic strategists our friend James Carville. He getting more and more unglued every day. Now he's comparing this election to [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1723.26s)]
*  slitting throats in World War Two. And I'm not making that up. I'm really not interested in being very fair about the whole thing. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1731.1s)]
*  OK. I'm there. I'm really I really don't think we should have fought fair against the Germans and the Japanese. I think we should [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1742.46s)]
*  have like snuck around them. And I think we should have you know gone behind him in the lines and cut their throats because that was [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1747.7s)]
*  what it was at stake. I think we're literally approaching the same place right now. I'm not talking about everybody. Stop. Don't think [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1754.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm not talking about actually splitting a political opponent's throat. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1763.54s)]
*  Don't fight fair slit their throats. But I don't mean actually. James you may need to check with your doctor. You may need to [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1767.66s)]
*  increase your daily dose of those gummies that you were talking about. Now think about this. Democrats the Biden administration they [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1776.78s)]
*  have tried to put Trump in jail. They have tried to remove him from the ballot in multiple states. They have pressured big tech [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1783.54s)]
*  companies to censor conservatives online. They held a bogus primary that Biden won by millions of votes before the party elites [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1790.74s)]
*  decided to remove him from the top of the ticket and simply installed Kamala Harris in a last minute political coup. Kamala herself [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1799.6200000000001s)]
*  has frequently called for the Senate filibuster to be eliminated so she can ram through her radical agenda like the radical Green [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1808.02s)]
*  New Deal with ease. Kamala is also apparently open to packing the U.S. Supreme Court which would all but eliminate a co-equal branch [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1815.34s)]
*  of our government and corrupt our system of checks and balances. Both Kamala Harris and Tim Walz routinely attacked the First [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1824.26s)]

*  shotgun. Anyway Democrats want Americans they want you to believe that Trump is a threat to democracy. Buckle up. The next 13 [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1838.46s)]
*  days the smear the slander the lying the besmirchment the attacks will get worse hour after hour after hour. Here's only one [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1849.02s)]
*  question that really matters. Are you better off than you were four years ago. That very question is a big problem for Kamala [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1859.3s)]
*  Harris and today our very own Sarah Carter caught up with several Harris supporters in Philadelphia who are now worried that [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1867.82s)]
*  Kamala might not have what it takes to win this election. Take a look to Vice President Kamala Harris is going to be here tonight. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1875.3s)]
*  I know. So you're going to be watching right. Yeah. What do you want to hear from her. Do you want. Is there something that you [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1882.46s)]
*  haven't heard yet that you'd like to hear. Do you. Well I want I know what her position is on the border and I know what her [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1888.22s)]
*  position is on inflation. But I also think that sometimes she tends not to get to the point. So I would really like her to [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1894.38s)]
*  explain it more pointedly. How are you feeling about the election today. I mean very worried very worried very worried. What has [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1902.46s)]
*  you worried. Yeah. Very very worried. Very close and I can't understand how it could be close. Mind if I ask you who you voted [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1910.22s)]
*  for. I voted for for Kamala. Do you feel the eyes on you. Oh yeah. It's very tense. Very tense. Especially as a walking tour guy [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1919.9s)]
*  talking about history. So oh well yeah this is it. I mean this is Independence Hall. This is our constitution our founding fathers. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1929.46s)]
*  How important is this election to you. I as a young voter. I think it's pivotal. How important is this election to you in modern [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1937.9s)]
*  political history right now. Yeah I guess it is pretty important. It does affect all of our lives obviously and we do need to make a good [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1946.42s)]
*  decision regarding who we choose. Oh that works. But I use that later tonight. Happy Wednesday everyone. So to encourage couples to [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1957.6200000000001s)]

*  moving to South Korea. Yeah. At a campaign event in Detroit Eminem introduced Barack Obama which makes sense. They both made a career out [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1977.5s)]
*  of pretending to be black. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=1994.62s)]
*  What do you say. If he would have said that two weeks ago I'd have been mad. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2004.06s)]
*  Self proclaimed witches have been trying to cast curses on Donald Trump. Sadly for them though they were beaten to the punch. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2011.1399999999999s)]
*  A new poll shows Trump with a slim lead over Harris with Arab Americans. Harris would attempt to speak directly to those voters but she [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2024.82s)]
*  hasn't yet nailed the accent. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2033.3799999999999s)]
*  Missouri TV reporter was hurt by a bullet fragment at a Democrat Senate candidate's gun demonstration nearly shooting a reporter. He must be [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2041.4599999999998s)]
*  trying to appeal to Republicans. But as one Democrat noted hey these things happen. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2050.7799999999997s)]
*  A drunk driver in Milwaukee nearly crashed into Kamala's motorcade. No one was injured and the boozed up driver claimed he was heading to [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2063.1s)]
*  Iraq. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2070.8199999999997s)]
*  Passengers on a Spirit Airlines flight from Dallas to L.A. freaked out when they saw a rat roaming around the plane. How embarrassing [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2081.3799999999997s)]
*  for the rat. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2090.8599999999997s)]
*  The NFL Players Association claims that having reporters in the locker rooms is an invasion of privacy especially if it's a late [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2095.06s)]
*  night talk show host pretending to be a reporter. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2101.4599999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2109.3799999999997s)]
*  And finally the insane clown posse has endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here they are without their makeup. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2111.4199999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2130.4599999999996s)]
*  My long time. So back in 2007 it written testimony to Congress. D.A. Kamala Harris showed herself capable of some truly [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2131.74s)]
*  inspired argumentation. There was only one problem that inspiring language wasn't hers. See when she wasn't just lifting a wine [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2139.58s)]
*  glass she was lifting all those sentences. According to the Washington Free Beacon Kamala's statement in support of a loan [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2148.62s)]
*  repayment plan for local prosecutors was taken almost verbatim from an Illinois D.A.'s opinion on the same subject that was [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2155.7s)]
*  given to the Senate months prior. Roughly 80 percent of her testimony was copied word for word from that old guy over there [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2163.62s)]
*  Carl Loughley of Winnebago County Illinois who by the way is a Republican. Holy. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2172.3399999999997s)]
*  That's like me stealing jokes from Jimmy Kimmel. I never do that not because he's my competition but because he has cancer of the [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2179.26s)]
*  funny bone. But that's not the only time she committed stolen verbiage. While she was California A.G. she published a report on sex [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2188.14s)]
*  trafficking in her state. In that she copied a fictional fictional example of the type of call received by the National Human [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2196.86s)]
*  Trafficking Hotline which told the story of how a woman in D.C. was saved from forced prostitution. But in a report Harris said [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2205.26s)]
*  never said the story was fake. Instead she changed the location to San Fran to get credit for a rescue that never actually [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2214.98s)]
*  happened. Dirty. There are other examples but this is at least the second time Harris has been caught in a blatant act of [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2223.42s)]
*  plagiarism. She's the literary version of a smash and grabber. Remember Kamala. Anything under 900 words and you won't get [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2230.32s)]
*  charged. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2238.36s)]
*  The language. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2241.8s)]
*  And the language is exactly the same line after line. Harris even kept the typos and grammar errors. She didn't even try to make [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2244.52s)]
*  her theft look like her own. I mean maybe it's because she loves rap and she considers it more like sampling. But it's weird you [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2252.04s)]
*  know that none of this is surprising. Perhaps because her only concrete policy proposal no taxes on tips she stole from another [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2260.12s)]
*  Republican. Her opponents. So in light of the fact that nothing Kamala says gives you any idea of what she believes. Is it any surprise [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2267.96s)]
*  that less than two weeks out from Election Day even Rachel Levine is asking who the hell is this woman. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2277.88s)]
*  Now all this comes on the heels of a report that Kamala lifted entire sections of her policy book Smart on Crime. Who knew she was [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2284.12s)]
*  actually talking about herself stealing. Even the New York Times which initially rushed to defend her finally had to admit her [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2295.12s)]
*  thievery. But the real point isn't Kamala's serial plagiarism. It's how in the past this would end a campaign. It would lead every [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2301.6s)]
*  newscast. This would be the October surprise. I mean this is way worse than what sunk Joe Biden in 87 when he was caught stealing [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2309.92s)]
*  speeches from a British leader. And worse it was this guy he stole it from. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2318.48s)]
*  But also Harris has no core principles or any non core principles. Her head is as empty as her husband's balls after nanny season. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2323.24s)]
*  There is a nanny season. Yes. She grew up in a middle class family. That was pretty well off. She's an American that spent her [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2341.72s)]
*  formative years in Canada and she's going to save democracy after she plotted a coup against her boss. I don't even know what Doug seasoners [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2356.8399999999997s)]
*  since she won't put him down for a nap. In fact she might be the least honest politician ever. Listen to her on the Biden decline [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2364.48s)]
*  cover up. Can you say that you were honest with the American people about what you saw in those moments with President Biden as you were [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2372.96s)]
*  with him again and again repeatedly in that time. Of course Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished experienced and and and capable. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2379.84s)]
*  You never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him. It was a bad debate. Can the American people [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2395.6000000000004s)]
*  trust you in these moments even when it's maybe uncomfortable for Americans to have to level with Americans in that way. I speak with [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2401.76s)]
*  not only sincerity but with a real firsthand account of watching him do this work. I have no reluctance in saying that. Apologies that [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2409.56s)]
*  should have come with bongos. Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished experienced and capable in every way. I speak with not only sincerity but [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2422.56s)]
*  with a real firsthand account of watching him do this work. It always makes more sense. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2442.68s)]
*  Incredible. But like the conveyor belt at the manure factory the load of crap keeps coming. Listen to her on transgender laws. Do you believe [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2456.8799999999997s)]
*  that transgender Americans should have access to gender affirming care in this country. I believe we should follow the law. I mean I think you're [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2466.68s)]
*  probably pointing to the fact that Donald Trump's campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars. They're trying to define you on this. Yes I'm asking you [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2473.8399999999997s)]
*  to define yourself though. Just broadly speaking what is your value. Do you believe they should have that access. I believe that that people as the law [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2481.16s)]
*  states even on this issue about federal law. What horse. The reporter even set up the question as a pro trans layup and she's still through a [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2488.64s)]
*  brick as if she actually has no impact on the law. And remember there are other laws she doesn't follow like the 25th Amendment. You know you [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2499.8799999999997s)]
*  thought Biden was an empty vessel. He's got nothing on this broad. Fact is we really don't know what this woman stands for. Maybe that's the [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2509.2799999999997s)]
*  point. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wszzBouru9c&t=2517.64s)]
