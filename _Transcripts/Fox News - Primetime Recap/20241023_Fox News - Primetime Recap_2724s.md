# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 22, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4)
*  Hello, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. This is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. As always, thank you very much for spending time with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=0.0s)]
*  All right. New science tonight that the Harris campaign is gasping for air. So Kamala took the day off from the campaign trail for airtime on NBC. And as she continues to pillory Trump's character and his credibility, how did she do in defending her own? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished, experienced and and and capable in every way that anyone would want if their president. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=23.0s)]
*  You never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=38.0s)]
*  It was a bad debate. People have bad debates. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=42.0s)]
*  He is absolutely. That's the reason why you're here and he's not running for the top of the ticket. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=45.0s)]
*  Well, you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=52.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=55.0s)]
*  I am running for president United States. Joe Biden is not. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=57.0s)]
*  It's a judgment question. That's why I ask. Can the American people trust you in these moments, even when it's maybe uncomfortable for Americans to to have to level with Americans in that way? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=61.0s)]
*  I speak with not only sincerity, but with a real firsthand account of watching him do this work. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=70.0s)]
*  I have no reluctance in saying that. No, of course I don't. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=81.0s)]
*  She's so indignant every time she's asked a logical question. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=84.0s)]
*  You're questioning Donald Trump's credibility. You're claiming he's exhausted. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=90.0s)]
*  And then you're making that ridiculous point about Joe Biden. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=95.0s)]
*  None of it adds up. And that took her all day to prepare for. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=99.0s)]
*  No wonder she's losing support, even among traditionally Democrat voters, I may add, which brings us to he say, Puebe. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=103.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=112.0s)]
*  Doesn't it seem like yesterday, Chicago, the DNC, all that joy, all that excitement in our community, we have a saying, see, said Puebe, which means yes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=114.0s)]
*  It means yes, we can. But tonight I'm here to tell you, yes, she can. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=131.0s)]
*  So we're going to say she said Puebe when somebody says is she qualified for the job? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=137.0s)]
*  We're going to say she said Puebe when somebody asks, is she going to be the first female president of the United States? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=142.0s)]
*  We're going to say she said Puebe. She said Puebe. She said Puebe. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=151.0s)]
*  But there is growing evidence tonight that for Kamala and the Hispanic vote, it's no say Puebe. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=159.0s)]
*  A new USA Today-Suffolk poll shows that Latino voters now prefer Trump over Harris by 11 points. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=166.0s)]
*  But how can this be? Because the D.C. establishment for years had warned conservatives that their tough stance on border enforcement, ending birthright citizenship, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=177.0s)]
*  that that would destroy its chances with America's fastest growing demographic group, Hispanics. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=188.0s)]
*  No one has come up with a math, a mathematical route to the presidency that allows you to have that kind of negative number with Latino voters. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=196.0s)]
*  And so what he's doing is actively repelling those people, actively making those people not want to vote for him. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=206.0s)]
*  I've been talking to communities across the country for the campaign, especially Latino communities. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=213.0s)]
*  I have reminded them about what we experienced for four years under Trump. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=220.0s)]
*  We know that that Trump and the GOP has abandoned Latino voters. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=225.0s)]
*  That could be my favorite montage of the week. And we've had a lot of good montages. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=230.0s)]
*  All right. But it turns out all those years ago, Trump and a few of us were 100 percent correct. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=236.0s)]
*  And the D.C. swamp, the Chamber of Commerce crowd, all the media types, they were wrong. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=243.0s)]
*  Hispanic voters, we insisted, wanted a strong economy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=249.0s)]
*  Hispanic voters wanted good schools. They wanted safe neighborhoods. They believed in family values. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=252.0s)]
*  And we said that that mass amnesty argument and open borders would hurt legal immigrants and poor people the most. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=257.0s)]
*  Well, fast forward nine years to today's Trump's roundtable in Miami. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=265.0s)]
*  Now, once again, we see that he was right and all of his critics were wrong. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=269.0s)]
*  More Hispanic Americans than ever are going full mega. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=274.0s)]
*  They respect him because he respects them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=278.0s)]
*  Mr. President, it's amazing what you've done for the Hispanic community. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=282.0s)]
*  And you are going to be rewarded handsomely for that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=288.0s)]
*  They've rewarded me already. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=291.0s)]
*  They produce for the country because the level of of genius entrepreneurship energy that they have, it's an incredible community. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=293.0s)]
*  And I like them and they liked me. And now they're seeing numbers that are shocking. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=302.0s)]
*  What else is shocking? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=307.0s)]
*  How hard inflation makes it for businesses, including Hispanic owned businesses, for them to be able to stay afloat and, of course, to grow. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=309.0s)]
*  In the last three and a half years, the worst years for businesses, inflation, interest rates with banks, prices, everything, everything, you know, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=319.0s)]
*  is nothing compared to 2017 to 20. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=329.0s)]
*  We need your help as soon as possible. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=334.0s)]
*  We need you help us with banks to stop regulations. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=337.0s)]
*  It is so difficult right now to create more jobs. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=341.0s)]
*  Ayudanos, por favor. Help us, please. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=345.0s)]
*  And rather than try to downplay the border issue at this event, Trump made it a focus. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=349.0s)]
*  But I really think that the biggest problem this country has is what they've allowed to happen to us on the border. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=355.0s)]
*  They've allowed our country to be destroyed. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=360.0s)]
*  What's happening to our country is so it's so crazy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=363.0s)]
*  You get angry and angry because it's it's so simple and it's so obvious and everyone knows it's true and nobody does anything about it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=366.0s)]
*  OK, wait, wait, wait, wait a second. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=373.0s)]
*  What about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris assuring us, Mr. President, that they've tightened up the border in recent months? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=375.0s)]
*  They're going to have open borders, 100 percent, just like they tried to trick everybody. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=383.0s)]
*  They said they tried to tighten it up a little bit just to make it because they have an election coming up. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=387.0s)]
*  Ah, and of course, from watching the angle and the reporting of our own Bill Mollusian, voters are learning the truth, aren't they? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=393.0s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of migrants are right now being fast tracked into the country by other means through humanitarian [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=401.0s)]
*  humanitarian parole, through special immigrant visas and via the CBP app. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=409.0s)]
*  And all communities are being swamped by this influx. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=415.0s)]
*  Local budgets, they're under strain by migrants who need schooling. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=419.0s)]
*  They need housing. They need health care. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=423.0s)]
*  And for all the women out there who are all in for Kamala, perhaps just for a moment, consider what her border policies are doing to young women and girls. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=425.0s)]
*  Fox confirming that the suspects arrested in Florida in connection with the sex trafficking of a 15 year old girl were in the United States illegally. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=436.0s)]
*  These people should have never been in this country. This should have never happened. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=448.0s)]
*  And we see this all the time. We've had four instances of Palm Beach County involved in illegals that came across the border, should have never been in this country and committed crimes. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=451.0s)]
*  The great interview by Martha McCallum and Harris's let him in and hope for the best approach to the border that has facilitated the largest child sex trafficking operation the world has ever seen. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=461.0s)]
*  How's that for girl power? And of course, Hispanic girls and are often the victims here and Hispanic voters know this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=474.0s)]
*  But rather than focus on ending this madness, protecting our own people and protecting the migrants, Democrats try to make Trump out to be the villain here. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=482.0s)]
*  It's his same old con. His same old con. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=492.0s)]
*  Doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=500.0s)]
*  Welcome to Donald Trump and Stephen Miller's America, where the federal government tries to coerce state and local governments to adopt the most anti-immigrant policies. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=507.0s)]
*  We rejected xenophobia of my predecessor and leaders like him around the world. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=519.0s)]
*  All right, Gramps. But despite the blowback from the blowhards, Trump kept going. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=525.0s)]
*  Because we all know this. A country without a border at some point is not a country at all. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=531.0s)]
*  How millions of people are arriving so quickly, so efficiently. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=538.0s)]
*  So this is the first group that's going to go to the border and then you're going to come back and pick up more people. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=544.0s)]
*  Exactly. This SUV pulls up and the migrants are loaded in one by one. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=549.0s)]
*  Every inch of space taken. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=554.0s)]
*  We did like 200, 300. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=557.0s)]
*  Of course, the Democrats knew that an open border would end up with situations like that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=563.0s)]
*  The cartels cashing in and Americans and migrants alike would be brutalized as a result. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=570.0s)]
*  But the thing that really gets me and a lot of this really gets to me, as you know, for 20 years I've been covering this issue. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=577.0s)]
*  Our borders arena and Alejandro Mayorkas, they didn't give a rip. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=584.0s)]
*  Remember, they're all about compassion. They don't care because they're fanatics. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=592.0s)]
*  But Hispanics are not. They're pragmatic and they're patriotic. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=597.0s)]
*  You're a builder. You're a uniter. You're courageous. You love and you create. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=603.0s)]
*  The other side of loving and building and creating is hating and destroying and dividing. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=610.0s)]
*  We have become from the land of opportunity, the land of exploitation. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=617.0s)]
*  And the exploiter in chief is Kamala Harris and this administration. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=622.0s)]
*  Well, the Democrats answered all this is just more of the same smears and fears. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=630.0s)]
*  So no matter what happens two weeks ago, two weeks from today, Donald Trump, the man the D.C. establishment excoriated for being anti Latino and anti immigrant, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=637.0s)]
*  will likely win the largest share of the Latino vote of any Republican in American history. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=647.0s)]
*  And if he wins the presidency, the GOP going forward will have a fighting chance in states like California and Colorado because success breeds more success. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=655.0s)]
*  Si se puede. And that's the angle. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=666.0s)]
*  Two weeks to go until Election Day and Democrats just yanked Kamala Harris off the campaign trail. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=669.0s)]
*  She took the day off. Zero campaign events today. And the only thing on her schedule, two interviews, not even live. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=674.0s)]
*  She spent all day preparing because that last interview with Brett, not that great. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=682.0s)]
*  Or maybe she wasn't preparing at all. We'll show you the interviews later and you can decide for yourself. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=687.0s)]
*  Trump says maybe she was getting her beauty rest. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=693.0s)]
*  She's sleeping right now. She couldn't go on the trail. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=696.0s)]
*  You know, you think when you have 14 days left, you wouldn't be sleeping. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=699.0s)]
*  Think of it. I said, where is she campaigning today, sir? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=703.0s)]
*  She's got a day off. You have 14 days left for the presidency. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=706.0s)]
*  She's taking a day off. This is not what you want. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=709.0s)]
*  This is not what you want. You can't get home first. Who the hell takes off? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=712.0s)]
*  You have 14 days left and she'll take a couple of more days off to you. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=716.0s)]
*  You know why? She's lazy as hell and she's got that reputation. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=720.0s)]
*  Let me see if we have this right. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=723.0s)]
*  Kamala calls Trump exhausted and then takes the day off. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=725.0s)]
*  McDonald's, football games, barbershops, town halls, round tables, rallies. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=728.0s)]
*  You've seen them. Kamala today didn't talk to a single voter. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=733.0s)]
*  She stayed home in D.C. And the media is getting nervous. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=737.0s)]
*  You know, everybody I talk to says, you know, I have to turn off the news. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=741.0s)]
*  I can't read anything. I'm meditating. I'm doing yoga. I'm doing... [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=744.0s)]
*  I'm so anxious. I just don't even know. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=747.0s)]
*  I'm eating gummies, all kinds of things, you know? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=749.0s)]
*  What are you doing? What are you doing? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=752.0s)]
*  Not eating gummies. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=755.0s)]
*  LAUGHTER [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=757.0s)]
*  Okay, we got that clear. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=763.0s)]
*  All right, no gummies. Maybe she spent the day doing yoga. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=767.0s)]
*  Because if she was preparing for the NBC interview, didn't look like it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=770.0s)]
*  You never saw anything like what happened at the debate night [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=775.0s)]
*  behind closed doors with him? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=778.0s)]
*  It was a bad debate. People have bad debates. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=780.0s)]
*  Should he...? He is absolutely... [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=783.0s)]
*  But that's the reason why you're here and he's not running for the top of the ticket. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=785.0s)]
*  Well, you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=790.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=793.0s)]
*  I am running for president of the United States. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=796.0s)]
*  Joe Biden is not. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=798.0s)]
*  And my presidency will be about bringing a new generation of leadership to America [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=800.0s)]
*  that is focused on the work that we need to do to invest in the ambitions and aspirations of the American people. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=807.0s)]
*  It's a judgment question. That's why I ask. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=814.0s)]
*  Can the American people trust you in these moments, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=816.0s)]
*  even when it's maybe uncomfortable for Americans to have... [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=818.0s)]
*  to level with Americans in that way? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=821.0s)]
*  So that's why I ask. And it sounds like what you're saying is you feel like you never saw anything like that from President Biden. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=823.0s)]
*  I have worked with Joe Biden, whether it... hours and hours and hours, over these four years, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=828.0s)]
*  whether it be in the Situation Room or the Oval Office. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=834.0s)]
*  I speak with not only sincerity, but with a real firsthand account of watching him do this work. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=837.0s)]
*  I have no reluctance in saying that. No, of course I don't. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=848.0s)]
*  Kamala's trapped because if she says she noticed Biden's decline, she's guilty of a cover-up. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=851.0s)]
*  But if she says she didn't notice, everyone knows she's just a liar. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=856.0s)]
*  So she's a liar either way. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=860.0s)]
*  And then she said the American dream was dead. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=862.0s)]
*  Are the last four years an obstacle to you in this race? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=865.0s)]
*  Here's how I look at it. First of all, let me be very clear. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=869.0s)]
*  Mine will not be a continuation of the Biden administration. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=874.0s)]
*  I bring my own experiences, my own ideas to it. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=876.0s)]
*  And it has informed a number of my areas of focus, most of which are, on to your point, lowering costs. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=879.0s)]
*  I haven't traveled in the country. I am very clear. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=885.0s)]
*  Cost of groceries is still too high. The voters know it. I know it. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=888.0s)]
*  So part of my plan includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=892.0s)]
*  including the work I will do dealing with price gouging, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=896.0s)]
*  something I dealt with when I was attorney general, something I will deal with going forward. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=899.0s)]
*  Cost of housing. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=903.0s)]
*  Cost of housing. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=904.0s)]
*  You know, I'm speaking with people of every background in every area of the country, of every age. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=905.0s)]
*  And, you know, the idea of the American dream was something that previous generations could count on, not as much anymore. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=911.0s)]
*  So the other week, she said she couldn't think of anything she'd do differently than Biden. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=917.0s)]
*  And now she says her administration wouldn't be a continuation. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=921.0s)]
*  OK, if Kamala had ideas about bringing prices down, why didn't she share them with Biden? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=926.0s)]
*  Why'd she tell us Bidenomics was working? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=932.0s)]
*  None of this makes any sense. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=935.0s)]
*  Where'd happy Kamala go? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=937.0s)]
*  She doesn't look like she's enjoying running for president. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=940.0s)]
*  She definitely wasn't ready to run for president. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=943.0s)]
*  Yesterday, she said, guys, you're scared. And so am I. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=946.0s)]
*  If I can just speak to what people are feeling, we cannot despair. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=950.0s)]
*  We cannot despair. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=959.0s)]
*  And I say do not despair because in a democracy, as long as we can keep it in our democracy, the people, every individual has the power to make a decision about what this will be. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=961.0s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=975.0s)]
*  So let's not feel powerless. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=976.0s)]
*  Let's not let the some. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=979.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=982.0s)]
*  Overwhelming nature of this all make us feel powerless because then we have been defeated. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=983.0s)]
*  Is that the saddest looking town hall you've ever seen? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=989.0s)]
*  Democrats are starting to ask, what if Joe Biden was the better candidate all along? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=992.0s)]
*  They want a coup do over. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=998.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris is not a godsend. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1000.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1004.0s)]
*  You people didn't even like her six months ago. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1005.0s)]
*  Now, all of a sudden, she's black female Jesus. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1007.0s)]
*  The way Obama was black Jesus. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1011.0s)]
*  And let me tell you something. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1014.0s)]
*  He had a lot more going for him than Kamala Harris does. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1015.0s)]
*  And not just as firsts go, but his type of campaigning, his type of persuasion, his charisma. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1018.0s)]
*  So while Harris takes the day off from campaigning, the real messiah is filling her shoes or heels. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1026.0s)]
*  Barry went to Wisconsin and Michigan today, but he sounded bitter. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1032.0s)]
*  Real strength about working hard. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1036.0s)]
*  Real strength about taking responsibility for your actions. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1039.0s)]
*  Real strength about telling the truth, even when it's inconvenient. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1043.0s)]
*  Real strength is about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can't stand up for themselves. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1047.0s)]
*  That's what we should want for our daughters and our sons. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1056.0s)]
*  That's what I want in the president of the United States. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1060.0s)]
*  Yeah, he has a guilty conscience after shivving Scranton Joe for a woman who can't even tell you what a woman is. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1065.0s)]
*  They're even dragging Michelle kicking and screaming out of her Hawaiian mansion to say this is the second time she's proud of the country. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1072.0s)]
*  Where's Michelle been since the convention? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1079.0s)]
*  If democracy was really on the line, shouldn't Michelle be living in the battlegrounds instead of Honolulu? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1082.0s)]
*  Every musician is now being ordered to campaign for Kamala. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1088.0s)]
*  After Usher, Lizzo, Stevie Wonder, the Harris campaign's bringing out Bruce Springsteen for a concert series. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1092.0s)]
*  Oh, and Barack's bringing out Eminem in Detroit. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1100.0s)]
*  Eminem endorsing Kamala. Does somebody have something on him? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1103.0s)]
*  Earlier in the day, actor Bradley Whitford from the West Wing put on quite the performance. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1109.0s)]
*  What's up, Man City? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1116.0s)]
*  65,000 rape victims. He was laughing. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1120.0s)]
*  Misogyny is at the reptilian brain stem of white Christian nationalism. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1127.0s)]
*  And that is what we are up against. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1144.0s)]
*  What's next? Is he going to yank his pinky off and light it like a cigarette? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1148.0s)]
*  And how lucky are we? How lucky are we to have Kamala Harris and Tim Ross? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1152.0s)]
*  If things are so great under the Biden-Harris administration, so great that it should continue, why is everybody so angry? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1160.0s)]
*  Why isn't it morning in America again? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1168.0s)]
*  The Harris campaign's running out of ideas and time. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1171.0s)]
*  According to CNN, their closing strategy is to count on Trump making outlandish claims. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1174.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can count on that. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1180.0s)]
*  But that's a strategy that has nothing to do with Kamala Harris or the American people, for that matter. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1183.0s)]
*  That's like asking Danica Patrick, how are you going to win the Daytona 500? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1190.0s)]
*  And she says, I'm hoping the guy in the lead crashes. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1194.0s)]
*  Oh, if that doesn't work, Biden has a better idea. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1198.0s)]
*  He thinks he has a right under the Supreme Court ruling on immunity to be able, if need be, if it was the case, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1203.0s)]
*  to actually eliminate, physically eliminate, shoot, kill someone who he believes would be a threat to. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1210.0s)]
*  I mean, so I know this sounds bizarre. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1218.0s)]
*  It sounds like if I said this five years ago, you'd lock me up. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1222.0s)]
*  We've got to lock him up. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1226.0s)]
*  Now we know he's definitely sabotaging her. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1233.0s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1237.0s)]
*  And tonight we are going to stop our election countdown because really every day is Election Day. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1238.0s)]
*  Right now is Election Day in most states, commonwealths in our country, and it's all across the country, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1244.0s)]
*  meaning you can vote today, tomorrow, the next day. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1251.0s)]
*  And you don't need to wait 14 days until officially Election Day, November the 5th. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1255.0s)]
*  Now, in fact, it is a good idea, my view, to bank your vote. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1261.0s)]
*  What if there's bad weather? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1266.0s)]
*  What if there's another, God forbid, hurricane or some other emergency on Election Day? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1268.0s)]
*  My recommendation, vote early. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1272.0s)]
*  Now, it's not the system I want. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1275.0s)]
*  We've talked about that a lot. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1277.0s)]
*  But you can't change the system unless you win elections. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1278.0s)]
*  I also highly recommend that you assume, especially if you're in, well, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1282.0s)]
*  Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, that your vote will decide this election because in a handful of swing states, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1290.0s)]
*  the margin of error is very, very thin. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1299.0s)]
*  And especially if you live in those seven swing states that I just mentioned, it just is what it is. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1303.0s)]
*  And this race is too important to leave anything to chance. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1308.0s)]
*  Polls are interesting, however, but there's only one poll that matters. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1312.0s)]
*  And that is what happens when we count the votes for the election. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1318.0s)]
*  Don't let any poll, good or bad, impact your thinking, your motions on this election. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1322.0s)]
*  Let us be very clear. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1328.0s)]
*  The American dream, in my view, is very much at stake. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1330.0s)]
*  If Kamala Harris's stated policies, her radicalism, extremism, is ever adopted in this country, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1334.0s)]
*  I would argue that America that we know today will be unrecognizable in four years. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1342.0s)]
*  Democrats, the state-run media mob, they already are telling voters to scale back your ambitions [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1346.0s)]
*  about what you think the American dream is. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1352.0s)]
*  Or as even the Washington Post put it, quote, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1355.0s)]
*  the new American dream comes with a smaller yard. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1358.0s)]
*  Why should we settle for less? Why should you settle for less? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1363.0s)]
*  Why should your children and grandchildren settle for less? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1366.0s)]
*  Don't we have an obligation to leave this country in better shape than we found it, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1369.0s)]
*  like our parents did for us, our grandparents did for all of us? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1373.0s)]
*  You know, this kind of negative thinking has been around since Jimmy Carter was encouraging Americans [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1376.0s)]
*  to turn down their heat in the winter, put on a sweater, suffer in silence. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1382.0s)]
*  Now, coming up, we're going to show you how the Harris campaign is now trying to normalize sky-high inflation, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1387.0s)]
*  higher taxes, rising crime, mass illegal immigration with free sex change operations. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1393.0s)]
*  But we begin with some good news. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1400.0s)]
*  We do look at some polls, but again, don't let it impact you. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1401.0s)]
*  The new USA Today-Soviet University poll has Donald Trump up by 11 points with Hispanic Americans. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1404.0s)]
*  Now, Trump lost this growing demographic by 11 points in 2020. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1413.0s)]
*  That's a 22-point swing, but as always, caution. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1417.0s)]
*  Remember that red wave in 2022, the one we thought was coming, never materialized. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1422.0s)]
*  And according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, fewer than three in 10 men in Georgia are supporting Harris. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1427.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is up by four, according to the AJC. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1434.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, early voting has been better than expected for the GOP. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1438.0s)]
*  But don't take my word for it. Here's left-leading journalist Mark Halpern. Listen closely. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1442.0s)]
*  If the early vote numbers stay the way they are, and that's a big if, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1447.0s)]
*  we'll almost certainly know before election day who's going to win the election. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1451.0s)]
*  We're going to talk a lot about that, the reasons why Democrats might be underperforming, the prospect that they'll recover. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1455.0s)]
*  But again, make no mistake, if these numbers hold up in the states where we can understand even partially what the data is like, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1462.0s)]
*  we'll know that Donald Trump's going to be president on election day. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1469.0s)]
*  Mark Halpern's a pretty smart guy. According to fake news CNN, the Harris campaign is now, quote, jittery. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1473.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, NBC News reporting that campaign officials, they are worried that Michigan and or Wisconsin will fall [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1480.0s)]
*  and that North Carolina is now slipping away for the Democrats. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1486.0s)]
*  But today, shockingly, Kamala Harris, he took the day off. She kind of took it easy. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1490.0s)]
*  With just 14 days until the official election day, although every day is election day, she didn't have a single rally. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1495.0s)]
*  And now Donald Trump, rightly accusing his opponent of being, well, lazy as hell. Take a look. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1502.0s)]
*  We were in a race with some very sick people. They're liars. They just lie. They lie about everything. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1508.0s)]
*  And I was going to hit her really hard on the trail today, but now I don't have to because she's off. She's off. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1514.0s)]
*  No, I can't get over it. Who the hell takes off? You have 14 days left and she'll take a couple of more days off too. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1522.0s)]
*  You know why? She's lazy as hell and she's got that reputation. She's a radical left lunatic. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1529.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, he was in Florida today meeting with Hispanic business leaders on Friday. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1536.0s)]
*  He will sit down for one of the most popular podcasts in the country, the Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1542.0s)]
*  You don't want to miss that. We'll have highlights on Friday night. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1547.0s)]
*  And tonight, Democrats, they're just in a state of utter panic. The other way to describe it. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1550.0s)]
*  They can't run on Kamala's terrible record or extreme beliefs. So they're going, well, repulsively negative. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1556.0s)]
*  And now the smears, the slander, the besmirchment, the outright fear mongering. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1564.0s)]
*  It's never been worse. And I've been doing this a long time. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1569.0s)]
*  Earlier tonight, President Biden accused Trump of wanting to shoot and to kill his political opponents and seemingly vowed to lock him up. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1572.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1581.0s)]
*  This is a guy who also wants to replace every civil servant, every single one. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1583.0s)]
*  He thinks he has a right under the Supreme Court ruling on immunity to be able, if need be, if he it was the case, to actually eliminate physically, eliminate, shoot, kill someone who he believes would be the threat to. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1589.0s)]
*  I mean, so I know this sounds bizarre. It sounds like I said this five years ago. You'd lock me up. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1605.0s)]
*  We got to lock him up. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1613.0s)]
*  Lock him out. That's what we have to do. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1618.0s)]
*  Just for the record, the only candidate that has been shot at in this election is Donald Trump. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1624.0s)]
*  He's also the only candidate facing prison time because of multiple bogus, politically charged investigation from Harris and Biden's weaponized Department of Justice. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1630.0s)]
*  But Democrats want you to believe that Trump is the threat to democracy? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1640.0s)]
*  Well, on this very question, even the Washington Post poll shows Americans believe Kamala Harris is the bigger threat, not Donald Trump. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1644.0s)]
*  Democrats are trying to gaslight the American people. That's all they've got. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1652.0s)]
*  And now our old friend, famed Democratic strategist James Carville, clearly I've know James well. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1656.0s)]
*  I've debated him many times, clearly in a state of utter panic and becoming a little unglued. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1663.0s)]
*  James, you might want one of those gummies. Take a look. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1669.0s)]
*  This is not an exaggeration. All right. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1672.0s)]
*  This is not. To say, well, he's really not. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1676.0s)]
*  It mean he's going to really like get rid of Social Security James. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1681.0s)]
*  No, he is telling you right to your stupid face that he is going to use the military to arrest and suppress his political opponents. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1685.0s)]
*  But I'm sure that I and everybody else that does this for a living is going to get asked, well, what about the swing voters in such and such a state that we know where they can all swing from the end of a rope? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1698.0s)]
*  Wow. OK, James, you said in an interview you like gummies and you took one the night that Joe Biden was debating Donald Trump. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1716.0s)]
*  Maybe it's time you got to chill a little bit. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1724.0s)]
*  James, if anyone could try to try to silence you, Rachel Maddow afraid her show is going to be canceled and everything. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1726.0s)]
*  I will personally stand up for all of you and I will fight for your right to be wrong on the airwaves. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1733.0s)]
*  I will fight for your freedom of speech. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1740.0s)]
*  It is not true. What is being said, it is fear mongering at the worst level. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1743.0s)]
*  The only Democrat that actually got it right was Bill Maher. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1748.0s)]
*  He was asked, well, Donald Trump wins. What are you going to do? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1752.0s)]
*  He goes, I'm going to stay. I'm going to do my show and make jokes about Donald Trump. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1754.0s)]
*  Nobody's getting arrested. No political opponents are going to be rounded up. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1760.0s)]
*  Does anyone in the Democratic Party, by the way, have any self-awareness at all? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1764.0s)]
*  Apparently not, because after lecturing the American, you know, men last week like he did and accusing them of outright sexism, quote the brothers, quote Barack Obama, he's just perplexed. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1769.0s)]
*  He just doesn't understand how America got so divided. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1782.0s)]
*  What about all the people who had their homes raided, pre-dawn raids, fake news, CNN cameras, all the people associated with Donald Trump, you know, arrested and fingerprinted, mug-shotted? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1786.0s)]
*  I guess what they're saying is they don't want what they did to Republicans done to them. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1798.0s)]
*  And by the way, it shouldn't be done to them. It shouldn't have been done this time. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1804.0s)]
*  But take a look. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1808.0s)]
*  No, this election is going to be tight. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1809.0s)]
*  It's going to be tight here in Wisconsin. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1813.0s)]
*  It's going to be tight all across the country. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1816.0s)]
*  And it's going to be tight because a lot of Americans are still struggling. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1819.0s)]
*  And people started feeling like no matter how hard they worked, they were just treading water. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1825.0s)]
*  So I understand why folks are looking to shake things up. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1831.0s)]
*  And I know it can be frustrating. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1837.0s)]
*  Look, I do not watch cable news. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1839.0s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1841.0s)]
*  There are times where I just I don't understand how we got so toxic and just so divided and so bitter. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1843.0s)]
*  Notice he said treading water. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1856.0s)]
*  He's acknowledging that for the last four years that Harris and Biden have failed. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1858.0s)]
*  They now the Washington Post is talking about lowering your expectations. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1865.0s)]
*  Maybe you'll have to buy a townhouse instead of a home with a backyard. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1869.0s)]
*  But really, Barack, what I what I really want to know, you know, I guess I'm one of those bitter Americans that cling to God, guns, my religion, my faith. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1873.0s)]
*  Or maybe I'm just an irredeemable deplorable, I guess. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1883.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1887.0s)]
*  And if we believe Jesus is Lord, by the way, and you say it at a Kamala rally, guess what? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1888.0s)]
*  They will tell you you are at the wrong rally. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1894.0s)]
*  Anyway, Biden Democrats that keep saying that Trump Republicans are a threat to democracy. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1896.0s)]
*  Well, why don't they run on the great economic success? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1901.0s)]
*  Ask yourself this. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1904.0s)]
*  Their closing argument is fear, calling Trump racist and a threat to democracy. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1906.0s)]
*  And of course, Mussolini and Hitler and Stalin. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1911.0s)]
*  Why don't they run on the great success of the economy? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1915.0s)]
*  Oh, that's right. Barack said we're treading water or that the border is safe and secure, which they told us for three years. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1919.0s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1926.0s)]
*  And how American towns and cities are more safe and more secure. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1927.0s)]
*  No defund dismantled, no bail laws kind of stop that. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1932.0s)]
*  And that you're paying a lot less at the pump than for energy. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1936.0s)]
*  No, we're paying about a buck, buck 50 more a gallon. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1940.0s)]
*  And what a great economy we have and what low inflation we have. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1943.0s)]
*  And we have a world. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1947.0s)]
*  Well, we have war on two continents, don't we? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1949.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1952.0s)]
*  Nothing has gotten better under Harris and Biden and their failed policies. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1954.0s)]
*  They've failed. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1959.0s)]
*  Americans are suffering. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1960.0s)]
*  It's an obvious time for change. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1961.0s)]
*  And that's why we see nothing but smears and slander and dismergment and character assassination from the left. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1963.0s)]
*  In fact, Democrats and their friends in the state run media mob, they have compared almost every Republican to every evil, you know, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1970.0s)]
*  leader in memoriam from Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and on. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1979.0s)]
*  And don't even get me started on the Russia hoax and the left's love of censorship in this country. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1984.0s)]
*  Many on the left are even hyper partisan when it comes to trivial matters. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1990.0s)]
*  Now, this week, the New York Times bashed Trump for not properly preparing french fries during his stop at McDonald's. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=1994.0s)]
*  And on TV, the hysteria was worse. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2002.0s)]
*  Whoopi's upset that he didn't wear a hair net. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2006.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2008.0s)]
*  Forever, he was saying. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2010.0s)]
*  She never worked at McDonald's. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2011.0s)]
*  You never. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2013.0s)]
*  So now he took himself to McDonald's. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2014.0s)]
*  That was McDonald's. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2016.0s)]
*  That was clothes. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2017.0s)]
*  That was clothes. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2018.0s)]
*  And he wasn't wearing a hair net, which really bothered me. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2019.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2022.0s)]
*  No net. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2023.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2024.0s)]
*  You. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2025.0s)]
*  I don't want your french fries. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2026.0s)]
*  She actually worked in a McDonald's. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2027.0s)]
*  She didn't go and pander and disrespect McDonald's workers by standing there in your red tie and take a picture. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2029.0s)]
*  He worked briefly as a fry cooker without a hair net, I might add. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2035.0s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2041.0s)]

*  Is that a threat to democracy? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2064.0s)]
*  Tonight, during an interview, Kamala still could not answer that question. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2065.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2069.0s)]
*  Can you say that you were honest with the American people about what you saw in those [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2070.0s)]
*  moments with President Biden as you were with him again and again, repeatedly, in that time? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2074.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2079.0s)]
*  Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished, experienced, and capable in every way that anyone would [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2080.0s)]
*  want of their president. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2094.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2095.0s)]
*  You never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2096.0s)]
*  It was a bad debate. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2099.0s)]
*  People have bad debates. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2101.0s)]
*  Should he? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2102.0s)]
*  He is absolutely... [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2103.0s)]
*  But that's the reason why you're here and he's not running for the top of the ticket. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2105.0s)]
*  Well, you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2109.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2112.0s)]
*  I am running for president of the United States. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2115.0s)]
*  Joe Biden is not. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2117.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2118.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2119.0s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2120.0s)]
*  You can come over later. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2121.0s)]
*  Happy Tuesday, everyone. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2136.0s)]
*  It appears that Donald Trump will reportedly make his debut on Joe Rogan this week. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2137.0s)]
*  In response, Kamala will appeal to her base by appearing on Love After Lockup. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2142.0s)]
*  First lady, Joe Biden said that Joe dropping out of the race was the right call. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2150.0s)]
*  Also, the right call, the one she made to 1-800 Chairlift. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2157.0s)]
*  The McDonald's Corporation says it doesn't have any evidence of Kamala ever working there, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2165.0s)]
*  though there are rumors of her sleeping with Mayor McChese. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2171.0s)]
*  Girl's gotta do what she's gotta do. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2175.0s)]
*  Following Trump's visit, the company says it also invited Kamala and Tim Walz to their restaurants. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2178.0s)]
*  The only stipulation is that Walz not be allowed within 500 feet of the play place. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2183.0s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2192.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2194.0s)]
*  A CNN investigation reports how political campaigns are exploiting elderly dementia patients to help fund their cause. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2197.0s)]
*  Don't I know it, says one man. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2204.0s)]
*  Saw that one coming, didn't you? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2208.0s)]
*  He didn't. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2211.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2213.0s)]
*  Former Abercrombie and Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries was arrested on criminal sex trafficking charges. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2214.0s)]
*  He's accused of recruiting young male models for parties. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2221.0s)]
*  So I guess this means we're not on for the 25th. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2225.0s)]
*  He said I would be on the cover of the catalog. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2231.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris is facing another plagiarism accusation. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2233.0s)]
*  Apparently, she lifted entire passages from another lawyer for her congressional testimony while she was San Francisco DA in 2007. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2236.0s)]
*  When reached for comment, Harris replied, if the glove don't fit, you must have quit. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2245.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2253.0s)]
*  Oh, stop it. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2254.0s)]
*  Was it worth it? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2256.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2257.0s)]
*  So last night, Kamala held a town hall and it had all the spontaneity of synchronized swimming. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2259.0s)]
*  I wonder, would the audience be able to ask questions? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2266.0s)]
*  Are we going to be able to answer questions? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2268.0s)]
*  You're not, unfortunately. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2271.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have some pre-determined questions and I hopefully I'll be able to ask some of the questions that might be in your head. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2272.0s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2279.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2280.0s)]
*  Sorry, Toots. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2281.0s)]
*  Sorry, Toots. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2283.0s)]
*  You're just a prop. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2284.0s)]
*  And come on, we didn't even give you a primary and you think we're going to let you ask unscripted questions? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2286.0s)]
*  Hell, Kamala can't even answer scripted questions. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2292.0s)]
*  We give her a week in advance. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2294.0s)]
*  So right off the bat, we got the lay of the land. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2297.0s)]
*  Another manicured platform for Kamala to blurt out her now legendary word salads. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2299.0s)]
*  I mean, this broad ought to come to every event with a side of ranch and a bag of croutons. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2303.0s)]
*  Still, these things cannot be overlooked. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2309.0s)]
*  These things cannot be overlooked. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2313.0s)]
*  And I have said many times publicly and I'll say it again, in many, many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2316.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2324.0s)]
*  An unserious man. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2325.0s)]
*  How rich coming from the candidate who is half Indian, half hyena. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2326.0s)]
*  But it's Trump who's the unserious person. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2333.0s)]
*  You know, the guy that built half the NYC skyline has already been president quite successfully, I might add. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2337.0s)]
*  The guy who raised a beautiful, successful family that anybody would be proud of. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2344.0s)]
*  A man who has literally taken a bullet for a job he didn't even need. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2348.0s)]
*  A man who our adversaries admit they respect and even fear. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2353.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's the unserious one, you dizzy dumbass. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2362.0s)]
*  And look at Liz Cheney sitting there. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2367.0s)]
*  She looks thrilled. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2371.0s)]
*  It's like she's thinking I quit my political party and all I got was this lousy wino. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2374.0s)]
*  But look, I watched the town hall for only one reason. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2379.0s)]
*  Hoping to hear one more time about the nature of a democracy where I think there's a duality. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2383.0s)]
*  The nature of a democracy is such that I think there's a duality. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2389.0s)]
*  On the one hand, there's an incredible strength when our democracy is intact. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2393.0s)]
*  An incredible strength in what it does to protect the freedoms and rights of its people. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2401.0s)]
*  Oh, there's great strength in that. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2407.0s)]
*  And it is very fragile. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2410.0s)]
*  It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2414.0s)]
*  Oh, I never get tired of hearing that. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2417.0s)]
*  And she never gets tired of saying it. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2422.0s)]
*  You know, I think that there's a duality to the nature of democracy. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2427.0s)]
*  When it's intact, oh, it's so strong. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2431.0s)]
*  So strong in its nature. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2438.0s)]
*  And it is very fragile. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2441.0s)]
*  There's a duality to the nature of democracy. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2445.0s)]
*  On the one hand, incredible strength when it is intact. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2449.0s)]
*  Incredibly strong. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2455.0s)]
*  And incredibly fragile. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2457.0s)]
*  The nature of democracy, there's a duality to it. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2461.0s)]
*  On the one hand, it's very strong. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2464.0s)]
*  When a democracy is intact, it is also very fragile. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2468.0s)]
*  Look, Kamala, if you're going to recycle old crap, at least dress it up a bit. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2473.0s)]
*  Tyrus's idea is always bongos. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2481.0s)]
*  The nature of a democracy is such that I think there's a duality. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2485.0s)]
*  On the one hand, there's an incredible strength when our democracy is intact. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2489.0s)]
*  An incredible strength in what it does to protect the freedoms and rights of its people. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2497.0s)]
*  Oh, there's great strength in that. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2503.0s)]
*  And it is very fragile. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2506.0s)]
*  It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2509.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2514.0s)]
*  Now to most people, she sounds stupid. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2516.0s)]
*  But is she really? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2519.0s)]
*  Jim Garrity at National Review suggests maybe she isn't. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2521.0s)]
*  He says the caricature of Kamala Harris as a bumbling dunce makes it easy to underestimate her. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2524.0s)]
*  It's kind of like how you root for Jesse Watters despite his glaring incompetence. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2529.0s)]
*  I mean, look at that. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2534.0s)]
*  Jim also claims that her skill is really getting Democrats emotionally invested in her. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2537.0s)]
*  It certainly worked with Willie Brown. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2543.0s)]
*  But that's more than a joke. It's a fact. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2547.0s)]
*  That getting Dems emotionally invested in her means she gets others to do the work she won't do, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2549.0s)]
*  whether it's Willie Brown or willing Brown voters. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2555.0s)]
*  See what I did there? I know. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2560.0s)]
*  But I get what Jim's saying. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2563.0s)]
*  Don't just say, wow, she's just a dummy, because even if you're right, no one's going to hear it. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2565.0s)]
*  People do the same thing with Trump. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2570.0s)]
*  They overlook his actual deeds and focus on his words. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2572.0s)]
*  Take the latest. Trump calling Democrat leaders the enemy from within. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2575.0s)]
*  Congressman, do you consider Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi to be the enemy from within? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2580.0s)]
*  Donald Trump doubled down on his Hitler talking points about the enemy from within. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2584.0s)]
*  Donald Trump repeatedly referred to prominent Democrats and others on the left in the United States, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2589.0s)]
*  American citizens, as, quote, the enemy from within, unquote. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2595.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has been given opportunity after opportunity to either downplay or clarify his comments [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2599.0s)]
*  about what he called the enemy from within. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2604.0s)]
*  A major party candidate calling his political opponents, quote, the enemy within. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2607.0s)]
*  All that douchebag outrage. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2618.0s)]
*  Even though Democrats not only said the same thing about enemies within, but they actually acted on it. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2621.0s)]
*  Remember when these a-holes claimed there was extremism within our military? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2629.0s)]
*  It was big news until the threat was debunked, then the story went away. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2633.0s)]
*  Or what about the scourge of white privilege and systemic racism that labeled a majority of people, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2637.0s)]
*  within the country, as oppressors and in need of serious reeducation that gave us a divided country, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2642.0s)]
*  DEI, and a s*** ton of terrible Disney movies? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2648.0s)]
*  And don't ever forget what they did to anyone during the pandemic who dared to question their BS policies and their lies. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2652.0s)]
*  So save your outrage. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2659.0s)]
*  Trump calling Pelosi and Schiff the enemy within is peanuts compared to calling tens of millions of Americans the enemy from within. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2661.0s)]
*  Hell, you even jailed a bunch of them while letting actual enemies from within, murderers, arsonists, and rapists, go free, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2668.0s)]
*  which created a new demand on the American public. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2674.0s)]
*  We now must be diligent all the time. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2677.0s)]
*  When we're on the streets, on public transportation, about what our kids are being taught in school, who's in our restrooms, who's coming into the country. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2679.0s)]
*  It's a lot of pressure on us and we're ready to blow. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2686.0s)]
*  So that's why the town hall had to be orchestrated. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2690.0s)]
*  You can't have ordinary people asking a phony candidate questions about the last four years. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2693.0s)]
*  It had to be stage managed, just like it was the last four years. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2698.0s)]
*  Because if you knew the truth, then you'd see the enemy within in all its glory, and you'd toss it out on its lion ass. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2701.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59EhvzdNJX4&t=2723.0s)]
