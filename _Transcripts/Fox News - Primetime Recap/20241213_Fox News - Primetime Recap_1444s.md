# Fox News Highlights - Dec. 12, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. This is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, my voice is a little creaky. It'll make it for the hour. A holiday from pessimism. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=7.28s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. There is nothing like Trump in New York. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=13.72s)]
*  USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=21.52s)]
*  Also, Trump at the opening of the New York Stock Exchange, it's just another sign that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=42.88s)]
*  his victory was the greatest comeback of all time. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=47.96s)]
*  Just optically, Jim, sort of a show of force of American business. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=52.72s)]
*  No, I mean, this is, I have to tell you, I'm trying to remember when I've seen such an [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=56.92s)]
*  agglomeration of people. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  Never, never. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  I don't think we've ever seen this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  No, and these are people, by the way, who all walks of business. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=64.4s)]
*  Business is not tech and it's not financial. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=67.76s)]
*  I think we have Brian Cornell from Target. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=69.88s)]
*  As it's often said, the business of America is business, but Trump's never been just about [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=73.52s)]
*  helping big companies. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=78.64s)]
*  He and his team know that small business is the backbone of America. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=80.83999999999999s)]
*  What do you want to tell the nation about investing right now? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, look, I think what we're going to see from President Trump is Wall Street can win [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=88.32s)]
*  and Main Street can win. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=92.44s)]
*  It's like Britain and Trump won. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=93.44s)]
*  Everybody can do Britain. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=96.44s)]
*  When Americans are on board, 65 percent say they have confidence in Trump's ability to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=98.56s)]
*  handle the economy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  So what does that tell us? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=105.56s)]
*  That regular Americans who actually had to live and work in Bidenville never believed [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  the snake oil that the Democrats were peddling. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  16 Nobel Prize winning economists say he would reignite inflation and Moody's says he would [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=116.2s)]
*  ignite a recession by the middle of next year. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=125.72s)]
*  Now, almost every economist who has looked at this idea says that won't lower prices, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=129.64s)]
*  that makes prices higher. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  Going forward, can we all make a pact to never refer to leading economists again? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=139.92s)]
*  They're always wrong, but never in doubt, like leading national security experts and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=146.64s)]
*  leading medical experts. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=151.24s)]
*  When they lean into politics, they're almost always proxies for the DNC. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=153.76s)]
*  We never, ever can forget how they abused their power and viciously lied in order to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  stop Trump. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=165.16s)]
*  And their miscalculation, let's face it, was epic. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=166.16s)]
*  He was a man on a mission, fighting through it all, not just for his own survival, but [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  for America's. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=175.44s)]
*  And now the focus is on the future. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=176.92s)]
*  I mean, it's exciting. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=179.32s)]
*  This morning is exciting to have a president that's pro-business, pro-economy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=181.06s)]
*  I mean, it's not just the stock market. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=185.9s)]
*  It's I want to make Americans better off. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=188.78s)]
*  There's a feeling, a very good feeling, pro-business, pro-excitement. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=190.94s)]
*  It's easy to see why there is so much optimism out there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=196.46s)]
*  Yeah, Trump's economic agenda is pro-business. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=199.26s)]
*  But more importantly, it's also pro-American worker. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=202.66s)]
*  We're going to give tremendous incentive like no other country has. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=207.06s)]
*  We're cutting your taxes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=210.26s)]
*  We're going to cut them very substantially. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=211.26s)]
*  We got them down to 21 percent. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  Now we're getting them down to 15. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=214.94s)]
*  But only if you make your product here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=216.92s)]
*  But of course, not everyone's happy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=219.78s)]
*  The greeny acts are predicting Armageddon because Trump's going to streamline things [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  over at the EPA. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=225.88s)]
*  Anybody investing a billion dollars or more gets a very expedited approval process because [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=228.18s)]
*  you know the approvals when people come into the country, it takes them in many cases, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  14, 15, 16 years to get the approval. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=239.46s)]
*  I love Melania's pantsuit. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=242.38s)]
*  Can I say that? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=243.82s)]
*  And for all you hammered by high energy costs because of Biden, and that's pretty much all [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=245.22s)]
*  of us, Trump has a holiday gift for you that will last at least four years. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=249.54s)]
*  We have one product that nobody has really to the extent that we do. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=255.34s)]
*  It's called oil and gas. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=258.72s)]
*  There is no country in the world that has more. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=260.7s)]
*  I brought it to number one during my first term in terms of production. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=262.98s)]
*  We're going to be number one plus. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=267.02s)]
*  When that happens, prices are going to start coming down because people can't afford their [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=268.68s)]
*  groceries and they're going to be affording their groceries very soon. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=272.2s)]
*  As some of you have told me that with Trump essentially already in charge, you almost [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=276.36s)]
*  feel like there's been a weight lifted off your shoulders, off your chest. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=282.24s)]
*  And I feel that too. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=286.08s)]
*  It's a great sense of relief you're feeling. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=287.08s)]
*  The scene over the weekend at Notre Dame, President-elect Trump was almost greeted as [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=290.12s)]
*  a conquering hero. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=293.76s)]
*  Literally the globalists were just in awe of what he pulled off. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=295.68s)]
*  Stunning, stunning to watch. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=300.48s)]
*  And we're about to have a real president again with a cabinet that will focus on America [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=302.92s)]
*  first. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=307.6s)]
*  So smart Democrats see that working with Trump is really the only sensible thing to do. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  We try to find the things that we can possibly agree on for the best possible outcomes. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=316.0s)]
*  And I represent Pennsylvania and to point out Donald Trump carried Pennsylvania. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=322.32s)]
*  That's why I have decided to engage with people that are going to be incredibly important [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=328.08s)]
*  parts of the new administration. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  Good for him. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=336.08s)]
*  And even Gretchen Whitless-Whitmer sending good vibes noting that Trump won her state [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=337.44s)]
*  and she hopes to find common ground. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=342.38s)]
*  But of course, most Democrats, they're not really feeling the jingle bell spirit right [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=345.52s)]
*  Because they're still reeling from Kamala's loss and adding insult to injury to them. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=349.92s)]
*  Now Trump's of course, Time's Person of the Year. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=354.96s)]
*  It's really been something very special and I have to say Time magazine getting this honor [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=358.6s)]
*  for the second time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=364.96s)]
*  I think I like it better this time actually. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=366.6s)]
*  The media has tamed down a little bit. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=370.32s)]
*  They're liking us much better now I think. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=371.96s)]
*  If they don't, we'll have to just take them on again and we don't want to do that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=374.4s)]
*  It was hilarious. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=378.48s)]
*  But seriously, who else could have gotten Person of the Year this year? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=380.16s)]
*  You can't give it to Taylor Swift again. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=384.28s)]
*  Well speaking of Taylor Swift, the angle does have some advice for her. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=387.56s)]
*  Call Trump and offer to perform at the inauguration. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=392.0s)]
*  It'd be smart for Taylor Swift and another great moment of unity for the country. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=398.4s)]
*  Come on Taylor, are you ready for it? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=404.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=407.6s)]
*  Look, anything's possible. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=408.6s)]
*  It's almost Christmas. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=409.96s)]
*  We've seen a lot of miracles this year. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=411.4s)]
*  Trump barely misses getting killed by an assassin's bullet. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=413.8s)]
*  Then he goes on to win the White House. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=416.6s)]
*  And we survived as well as a country, at least so far, living under a long gone Biden. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  And now America has a chance with its best fighter back in the ring. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=425.88s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=431.64s)]
*  Fox News alert. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=432.64s)]
*  The Justice Department just released the bombshell report that we've been waiting for. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=433.68s)]
*  What actually happened on January 6th? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=438.08s)]
*  The FBI had 26 confidential human sources there that day. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=440.96s)]
*  26. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  A confidential human source is a guy the FBI pays to spy for them. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=446.91999999999996s)]
*  Of the 26 confidential human sources who were in D.C. on Jan 6th, four entered the Capitol [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=451.96s)]
*  during the riot. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=457.4s)]
*  An additional 13 entered the restricted area around the Capitol. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=458.76s)]
*  So more than a dozen FBI spies participated in the so-called insurrection. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=463.56s)]
*  A bunch of them broke into the Capitol. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=468.4s)]
*  Their own inspector general says this is what happened. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=471.12s)]
*  But that's not what they told you when they testified under oath. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=474.59999999999997s)]
*  Those who were there in an undercover capacity on January 6th, how many were there? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  Again, I'm not sure that I can give you that number as I sit here. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=483.56s)]
*  I'm not sure there were undercover agents on scene. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=487.0s)]
*  I thought I heard you say you didn't know whether there were FBI agents or informants [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=490.48s)]
*  or human sources in the Capitol or in the vicinity on January 6th. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=496.96s)]
*  Did I misunderstand you? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=502.28s)]
*  I thought that's what you said. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=503.28s)]
*  Well, I referred very specifically to undercover agents. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=504.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=507.04s)]
*  And so are you acknowledging then there were undercover agents? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=508.04s)]
*  As I sit here right now, I do not believe there were undercover agents on scene. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=513.0s)]
*  The inspector was hiding something, so Congress asked the question a different way. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=517.64s)]
*  Listen. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=521.88s)]
*  Did you have confidential human sources dressed as Trump supporters inside the Capitol on [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=522.88s)]
*  January 6th prior to the doors being opened? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  Again, I had to be very careful. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=531.72s)]
*  It should be a no. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=533.4s)]
*  Can you not tell the American people? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=535.08s)]
*  No. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=536.96s)]
*  We did not have confidential human sources dressed as Trump supporters positioned inside [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=537.96s)]
*  the Capitol on January 6th. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  You should not read anything into my decision not to share information. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=544.8s)]
*  Director Ray, gentlemen's time. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=549.8s)]
*  Ray's right. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=552.4399999999999s)]
*  The FBI didn't have undercover agents at January 6th. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  They had confidential human sources. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=556.9599999999999s)]
*  So what's the difference? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=559.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, a confidential human source doesn't get health insurance or a pension. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=560.5999999999999s)]
*  They're just freelancing for the feds. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=564.7199999999999s)]
*  Rats in MAGA hats. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=566.7199999999999s)]
*  They're basically paid informants at the FBI runs at headquarters. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=569.0799999999999s)]
*  A lot of these FBI rats get picked up on some other charge. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=573.48s)]
*  They get sat down and the FBI says you're going to work for me now. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=577.4000000000001s)]
*  And if you don't, you're looking at 20 years to life. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=580.6s)]
*  So these guys say, yes, sir. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=583.6400000000001s)]
*  And they cozy up to people like the Proud Boys and anyone the feds wants to watch and [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=585.84s)]
*  control from the inside. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=590.0s)]
*  And these confidential human sources are under pressure to deliver. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=592.5200000000001s)]
*  What does deliver mean? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=596.6s)]
*  That means intelligence and big busts that get the FBI good headlines. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=598.44s)]
*  According to the Inspector General report, the spies were feeding the FBI intel that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=603.84s)]
*  said January 6th was going to get a little hairy. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=608.6s)]
*  But FBI headquarters did nothing about it and then lied to Congress and said they did. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=612.6800000000001s)]
*  So why did headquarters let January 6th get so out of hand? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=618.44s)]
*  And what were all these FBI spies doing that day and the days before? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=623.24s)]
*  Were they riling everyone up like they did in the Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping plot? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=628.12s)]
*  In that case, the FBI informants instigated the plot. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=633.04s)]
*  They even used an FBI credit card to buy the ammo, supplies and hotel rooms. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=636.2s)]
*  Did the FBI pay for Jan 6 hotel rooms? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=641.24s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=645.68s)]
*  Remember, the media and the Democrats said this whole thing was a conspiracy. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=646.68s)]
*  Where do you think this idea comes from? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=651.36s)]
*  This was somehow done by the feds? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=653.72s)]
*  I heard that one of the debaters said it was an inside job. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=657.16s)]
*  What is an inside job on the part of Donald Trump and his henchmen? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=661.72s)]
*  Republicans have blamed the FBI and said it was an inside job. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=666.48s)]
*  It certainly was not an inside job by FBI agents or Antifa. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=669.92s)]
*  They go around blaming it on Antifa and FBI agents. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=675.04s)]
*  How did the media know it wasn't an inside job when the FBI had 26 of their people on [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=678.8s)]
*  the inside? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=683.72s)]
*  January 6 certainly benefited the media, the FBI and the Democrats. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=685.84s)]
*  1500 arrests humiliated Trump, got him impeached, criminalized the MAGA movement. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=690.4s)]
*  Trump got indicted over January 6, remember? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=695.5600000000001s)]
*  They tried to throw him in prison over this. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=698.44s)]
*  The January 6 committee, it's all Democrats did for two years. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=700.96s)]
*  Why didn't the committee find any of these snitches? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=704.9200000000001s)]
*  They did a one-sided investigation and teed up garland to charge Trump so they could run [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=708.1600000000001s)]
*  against a convicted felon. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=712.4000000000001s)]
*  So the media is going to apologize, right? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=714.8s)]
*  No. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=717.3599999999999s)]
*  The media today is cherry picking the report to say there were no undercover agents there [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=718.3599999999999s)]
*  on January 6. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=724.7199999999999s)]
*  The whole thing is a conspiracy. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=725.92s)]
*  These aren't articles, they're FBI press releases. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=728.4799999999999s)]
*  And they wonder why their ratings are trash and no one trusts them. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=732.4799999999999s)]
*  It's because of this. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=735.04s)]
*  They don't want the truth. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=737.24s)]
*  They want to hide it if it hurts the left. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=738.24s)]
*  And they can't admit they were wrong because it's too embarrassing. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=740.74s)]
*  And they were a part of the cover-up. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=743.7s)]
*  But the FBI is worse than the media. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=746.24s)]
*  The FBI knew what was in this report. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=748.6s)]
*  They covered it up before the election. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=751.5600000000001s)]
*  And then the director says he's resigning the day before it comes out. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=757.2800000000001s)]
*  This kind of sliminess is why Trump nominated Cash Patel. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=759.7s)]
*  I wonder what else Cash is going to find in the Bureau when he looks under the hood. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=764.24s)]
*  As a former federal prosecutor and a public defender who defended a lot of these types [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=768.72s)]
*  of cases, what you need to show is whether or not the FBI and government agents were [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=772.72s)]
*  using undercover operatives and informants on the day of January 6. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=777.48s)]
*  Once you prove that, then you defeat the insurrection narrative with the FBI's own documentation. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=781.6s)]
*  And what does this report do to the January 6 defendants? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=788.56s)]
*  None of the confidential informants were arrested or charged. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=792.88s)]
*  These guys were right alongside everyone, walking into the Capitol. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=796.52s)]
*  But you're in prison for years. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=800.38s)]
*  If you're a defense attorney for a Jan Sixer and this drops after the case was decided, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=802.4399999999999s)]
*  that could change everything. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=807.8s)]
*  Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley says this, quote, there is a question of why [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=810.68s)]
*  the confidential human sources who entered the Capitol were not charged as part of an [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=814.64s)]
*  operation that the Justice Department described as an effort to shock and awe targeting everyone [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=818.88s)]
*  involved that day. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=826.12s)]
*  This report does not find specific wrongdoing or direction from confidential human sources [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=828.12s)]
*  in the rioting. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=832.84s)]
*  Congress, however, is likely to seek more information on these sources and their conduct [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=833.84s)]
*  on the day. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=838.88s)]
*  Are you allowed to commit crimes as a spy for the FBI and not get charged? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=840.84s)]
*  Because they said this was the greatest attack on democracy ever. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=845.88s)]
*  Said it was up there with 9-11. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=849.5600000000001s)]
*  Traitors, they said, seditionists, they're off scot-free. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=851.76s)]
*  You can try to overthrow the government if you're an FBI rat and just walk away. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=856.86s)]
*  Congress has to find out. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=861.5s)]
*  And what does this mean for pardons? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=863.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the Hunter Biden pardon already greased the runway for Trump, but this reports all [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=866.0600000000001s)]
*  the ammo Trump needs. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=871.0600000000001s)]
*  He told Time magazine, it's going to start in the first hour, maybe the first nine minutes. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=873.14s)]
*  Now if I were president, I don't think I'd pardon J Sixers who were slugging cops. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=879.74s)]
*  But if you were wandering around peacefully, come on. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=883.94s)]
*  And it's not just Cash Patel that's going to clean house. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=887.4000000000001s)]
*  Tulsi's on deck. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=889.84s)]
*  I'm here with Tulsi Gaffer. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=890.84s)]
*  She's here on the Hill meeting with my colleagues. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=891.84s)]
*  She's going to be a great DNI, Director of National Intelligence. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=892.84s)]
*  It's a really important job. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=897.84s)]
*  It oversees all of our intelligence agencies. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=900.84s)]
*  And it's a need of reform. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=903.84s)]
*  I think everybody would admit that. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=904.84s)]
*  And so we need to bring in a reformer. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=905.84s)]
*  Now the deep state's never been this backed into a corner, ever. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=908.5200000000001s)]
*  We have Trump assassination files that we want to release. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=912.2s)]
*  JFK assassination files, COVID files, Epstein, Diddy. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=915.5s)]
*  What about that pipe bomb? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=921.2s)]
*  Is the FBI still working on that one? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=923.0600000000001s)]
*  Who planted that? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=925.26s)]
*  It's just another conspiracy theory that you were right about. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=927.5400000000001s)]
*  The lab leak, the lab top, and now Jan six. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=931.22s)]
*  No wonder Biden's under pressure to dish out more pardons. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=934.98s)]
*  Who knows how high this thing goes. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=938.34s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=940.22s)]
*  Tonight, well, you just can't trust your own eyes, your own ears, and pictures, and videos. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=941.24s)]
*  Or at least that's the message from the Biden administration. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=946.8000000000001s)]
*  After saying almost nothing about the hordes of bus-sized, sophisticated, very loud flying [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=950.36s)]

*  it probably is not happening at all. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=967.74s)]
*  According to John Kirby, you just can't believe your lying eyes. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=971.12s)]
*  What you see there, it's not real. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=974.54s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=976.3s)]
*  Using very sophisticated electronic detection technologies provided by federal authorities, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=978.54s)]
*  we have not been able to, and neither have state or local law enforcement authorities, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=984.86s)]
*  corroborate any of the reported visual sightings. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=989.58s)]
*  Now remember the Biden administration, they would never lie to you. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=994.38s)]
*  So give them credit, give them the benefit of the doubt, except they did lie about that [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=997.52s)]
*  Chinese spy balloon thing, you might recall, and not leaving Americans behind in Afghanistan. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1002.28s)]
*  They did abandon many of them and our allies also. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1007.62s)]
*  And they did lie about inflation being transitory, but don't hold that against them. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1011.72s)]
*  And they did deny and lie about Biden being sharp as a tack and his cognitive decline. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1016.52s)]
*  But maybe the biggest lie of all was about the border, because for years the Biden White [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1023.42s)]
*  House, Mayorkas, Kamala Harris, Joe, everybody across the board, they said the border was [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1029.06s)]

*  The illegal immigrants from all over the world, over 180 countries, pouring into Mexico, walking [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1039.74s)]

*  It's not when, it's when, it's not if. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1079.88s)]
*  And when, if that happens, and I pray I'm wrong, I pray to God I'm wrong, they will [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1084.5800000000002s)]

*  Now this is a nightmare waiting to unfold. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1092.48s)]

*  Illegal immigrants under bridges, living in tents, sleeping on sidewalks, pouring across [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1098.24s)]

*  terrorists, rapists and other dangerous criminals, border patrol agents, they were all too busy [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1112.3799999999999s)]
*  just processing these unvetted illegals, releasing them into the country or flying [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1117.5s)]
*  them directly into the country by the millions. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1122.92s)]
*  All told more than 12 million unvetted Harris-Biden illegal immigrants entered the country in [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1125.6599999999999s)]
*  the last four years. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1131.12s)]
*  Now that we, these are people that we know about. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1132.78s)]
*  That is more than the entire population of New York City. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1136.18s)]
*  These so-called gotaways slipped through undetected, including all these people that I've been [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1140.22s)]
*  mentioning to you, all under the current White House, all under Biden and Harris, and all [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1144.78s)]
*  happening right before our very eyes. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1150.78s)]
*  You see the drug overdoses skyrocketing, more people killed by fentanyl in the last four [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1153.06s)]
*  years than ever before in human history. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1157.46s)]
*  Almost all of it came right across that border. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1160.46s)]
*  Other Americans murdered, raped, assaulted by people who never should have been allowed [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1163.6200000000001s)]
*  into our country. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1168.22s)]
*  And meanwhile, big cities, small towns all across the country, all of them have suffered [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1170.26s)]
*  needlessly from a sudden influx of Harris-Biden illegal immigrants. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1175.78s)]
*  They need food, they need shelter, they need healthcare, they need education. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1180.76s)]
*  You're paying for it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1184.8600000000001s)]
*  2,000 miles north of the border, even New York City was struggling to keep up and spending [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1186.1399999999999s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars housing illegal immigrants in hotels, three, four-star hotels. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1191.7s)]
*  But in New York City, at least, that insanity is going to come to an end. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1198.54s)]
*  And when Donald Trump's president, all of it will come to an end, as he has said over [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1202.4199999999998s)]
*  and over. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1207.34s)]
*  He will seal the border on day one. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1208.34s)]
*  That means new walls, new security measures, fewer restrictions on border patrol. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1210.56s)]
*  They'll be able to do their job. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1215.42s)]
*  The end of catch and release. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1216.98s)]
*  Stay in Mexico policy. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1218.74s)]
*  I'm sure we'll be back. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1219.94s)]
*  A slew of executive orders that will prevent asylum abusers from entering the country. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1221.7s)]
*  Mexico and Canada, they will now be held accountable. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1227.54s)]
*  There will be a massive amount of deportations, even to countries that do not want their own [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1230.22s)]
*  citizens back. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1235.54s)]
*  During an interview for Time magazine and the Person of the Year edition, Donald Trump [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1236.94s)]
*  said he would refuse to do business with countries who won't repatriate their own people. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1241.58s)]
*  Tariffs, other penalties are also on the table. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1246.8999999999999s)]
*  And according to Trump, quote, I will do whatever it takes to get illegal immigrants out of [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1250.46s)]
*  our country. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1255.24s)]
*  Trump even reportedly plans to lift restrictions on ICE arrests at churches, schools and hospitals. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1256.4399999999998s)]
*  And now, because of the magnitude of this crisis created by Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1262.98s)]
*  Alejandro Mayorkas, even some Democrats are ready and willing to work with Donald Trump [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1267.94s)]
*  on this effort. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1273.94s)]
*  Shockingly, even Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said they're going to have to go through me [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1275.5s)]
*  and New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1280.5800000000002s)]

*  After the meeting, Adams expressed grave concern for the horrific crisis that was caused by [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1291.1000000000001s)]
*  Joe and Kamala. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1296.5800000000002s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1297.6599999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1298.6599999999999s)]
*  We will not be a safe haven for those who commit violent acts. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1299.6599999999999s)]
*  We don't do it for those who are citizens and we're not going to do it for those who [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1303.98s)]
*  are undocumented. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1309.1799999999998s)]

*  500,000 children. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1327.28s)]
*  There's a level of hypocrisy that everyone that states they want to protect everyone [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1329.48s)]
*  but innocent individuals who are victims of crimes and children. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1333.2s)]

*  The days of outright lying, gaslighting, they are over. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1343.52s)]
*  Joe Biden failed our country. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1346.88s)]
*  Americans, many are dead. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1348.72s)]
*  Children are missing because of these terrible policies. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1351.0s)]
*  And now in his final act, Joe Biden is trying to sabotage the incoming Trump administration [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1354.34s)]
*  and hurt our country, frankly, just out of spite. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1360.0s)]

*  Donald Trump will have to buy it back at full cost when construction resumes. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1370.3s)]

*  Why to boost left-wing causes on his way out? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1382.72s)]
*  Biden signed off on big new contracts with thousands of government workers, and they [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1386.2s)]
*  are speeding judges through confirmation at a record pace. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1390.7s)]

*  Lisa Murkowski, are you paying attention? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1397.2s)]
*  And by the way, in the case of all of these, you know, you got to give props to Democrats. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1399.28s)]

*  Labor Relations Board through a lame duck vote. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1410.44s)]
*  And meanwhile, they prevented that from happening. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1413.28s)]
*  Overseas, Biden is escalating the war in Ukraine. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1415.6000000000001s)]
*  He's leaving Trump with one disaster after another. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1418.48s)]
*  He's making it worse on the way out. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKsehAmRCg&t=1421.18s)]
