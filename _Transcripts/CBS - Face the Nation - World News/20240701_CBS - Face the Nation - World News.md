# France's far-right nationalist party leads in first round of legislative elections
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98)
*  Well, voters in France stunned [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=0.0s)]
*  President Emmanuel Macron, we [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=1.84s)]
*  assume, with a historic defeat [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=3.54s)]
*  in the first round of voting for [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=5.34s)]
*  a new parliament. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=7.18s)]
*  His centrist party finished [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=8.44s)]
*  third behind supporters of the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=9.84s)]
*  left and the right, with a far [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=11.9s)]
*  right-wing party led by Marine [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=13.84s)]
*  Le Pen taking first place. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  Now, the second and final round [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=19.94s)]
*  of voting takes place next [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=21.6s)]
*  Sunday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=22.8s)]
*  Elaine Kopp has more from [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=23.68s)]
*  Paris. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=24.98s)]
*  Far-right leader Marine Le Pen [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=27.18s)]
*  said her party virtually wiped [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=28.88s)]
*  out President Emmanuel Macron's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=30.92s)]
*  centrist power base. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=32.84s)]
*  That, after her national rally [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=34.28s)]
*  party, took a third of the vote [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=35.84s)]
*  in Sunday's first round of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=37.74s)]
*  parliamentary elections. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=39.24s)]
*  President Macron called these [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=40.82s)]
*  snap elections, hoping to rally [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=42.18s)]
*  voters against the far right. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=43.92s)]
*  President Macron made a colossal [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=46.22s)]
*  error of judgment. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=47.78s)]
*  Professor Douglas Webber says [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=48.78s)]
*  Macron may have to share power [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=50.22s)]
*  with the national rally party. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=51.92s)]
*  It is anti-immigration, wants to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=53.84s)]
*  roll back the power of the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=55.68s)]
*  European Union and has threatened [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=56.92s)]
*  to pull France out of NATO. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=58.96s)]
*  Party President Jordan Bardella [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  wants to pull back support for [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine if he becomes Prime [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=65.82000000000001s)]
*  Minister. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=67.66s)]
*  This would be a very good [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=68.4s)]
*  result for Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=69.5s)]
*  It would be a very bad result [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=71.36s)]
*  for Ukraine. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=73.36s)]
*  Thousands of left-wing supporters [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=75.8s)]
*  gathered in central Paris to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=77.66s)]
*  voice their concern at the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=79.86s)]
*  far-right performance. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  The far right has been surging [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=83.0s)]
*  across Europe. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=84.9s)]
*  Should it win in France? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=86.2s)]
*  A warning. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=87.56s)]
*  There will be a vacuum at the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=88.66s)]
*  heart of Europe and no one or no [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=89.84s)]
*  other group of countries could [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  conceivably fill the role that's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  historically been played by [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=96.94s)]
*  France and Germany. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=98.1s)]
*  And that's, of course, the main [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  reason why so many people, so [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=100.44s)]
*  many observers are extremely [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  worried. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=103.9s)]
*  The decisive final round is next [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=105.64s)]
*  Sunday. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=107.44s)]
*  Macron has called on voters from [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  across the political spectrum to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  block the far right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=111.74s)]
*  So Elaine is joining us now to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=113.96s)]
*  talk a little bit more about [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=115.3s)]
*  these early results. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=116.28s)]
*  And just to sort of clarify for [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=117.3s)]
*  an American audience that after [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=119.34s)]
*  this election is over, Macron [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=121.24s)]
*  will still be the president. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  These are parliamentary [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=125.14s)]
*  elections. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=125.97999999999999s)]
*  So he would be working with a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=126.34s)]
*  different prime minister and it [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=127.84s)]
*  looks like now a prime minister [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=130.24s)]
*  who is not from the same party [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=131.68s)]
*  as him. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=133.1s)]
*  He did this to himself. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=134.18s)]
*  He called a snap election. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=135.54s)]
*  Elaine, remind us how we got to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=137.28s)]
*  this point. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=139.48s)]
*  Anne-Marie, it was because three [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=143.1s)]
*  weeks ago, Europe-wide elections [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=145.2s)]
*  showed a move to the far right, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=147.6s)]
*  including in France, where [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=149.33999999999997s)]
*  Marine Le Pen's National Rally [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=151.54s)]
*  Party did very well and where [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=152.94s)]
*  Macron's party did not do well. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  And so he said, everyone was [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  expecting a government reshuffle [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=160.64s)]
*  and he just said, no, I am [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=161.94s)]
*  dissolving the parliament. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=163.14s)]
*  I'm sending it back to the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=164.38s)]
*  people. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=165.64s)]
*  You tell us what you want. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  And it seemed clear he was [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=168.04s)]
*  hoping that France would say, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=169.64s)]
*  OK, we need to stop the far [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=171.64s)]
*  right. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  But many of the voters that we [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=174.34s)]
*  spoke to here yesterday and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  during the week said, we also [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=178.34s)]
*  want a change from Macron. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  We are not happy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=181.74s)]
*  We don't feel that his [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=182.98000000000002s)]
*  government has listened to us. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=184.0s)]
*  People have been concerned about [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=186.10000000000002s)]
*  their loss of spending power, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=188.18s)]
*  that pension protests badly [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=190.4s)]
*  damaged his image. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=192.3s)]
*  And there's an increasing feeling [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=193.68s)]
*  that the president is just more [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=195.54000000000002s)]
*  isolated from the people. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=197.18s)]
*  So the next round of voting [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  happens on July 7th. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=200.8s)]
*  And there's some question as to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=202.18s)]
*  everyone's off on summer [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  holidays. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=204.32s)]
*  So how many people are actually [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  going to participate in the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=205.72s)]
*  process, you know, is sort of up [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  in the air. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=208.66s)]
*  But this could have sort of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=209.82s)]
*  wider implications even beyond [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=211.42s)]
*  France. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=213.22s)]
*  And you kind of touched on it a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=213.72s)]
*  little bit in your story. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=214.92s)]
*  You know, how could this shift [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=216.32s)]
*  things in France politically and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=217.88s)]
*  beyond? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=220.06s)]
*  In France, the president is [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  going to have to deal almost [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=225.26s)]
*  certainly with either an extreme [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=226.92s)]
*  right government who would not [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=229.76s)]
*  share his ideals or with an [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=232.12s)]
*  ad hoc mix of the left, the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=234.4s)]
*  center and some of the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  conservatives who did not want [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=239.76s)]
*  to go with the far right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=241.36s)]
*  And either way, it's what the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=242.8s)]
*  French call a cohabitation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=244.76s)]
*  And it will involve a lot of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=246.46s)]
*  negotiating every time they want [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=248.12s)]
*  anything. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=249.72s)]
*  The extreme right, if it has a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=250.4s)]
*  government, will definitely want [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=252.0s)]
*  to block many issues they've [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  already threatened to pull out [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=255.86s)]
*  of NATO. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=257.66s)]
*  And that is going to make life [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=258.6s)]
*  much more complicated and lead [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=260.9s)]
*  to a lot of political [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=262.44s)]
*  instability within France. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=264.0s)]
*  Now, France and Germany have been [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=266.28s)]
*  the power couple in the EU. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=267.88s)]

*  domestic issues at the moment. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=272.84s)]
*  So France has very much been [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=274.7s)]

*  So if Macron is busy and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=278.47999999999996s)]

*  vacuum. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=285.23999999999995s)]
*  And that worries people. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=286.09999999999997s)]
*  And of course, Marine Le Pen has [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=287.4s)]
*  been cozying up to Vladimir [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=289.7s)]
*  Putin. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=291.53999999999996s)]

*  how he works. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=296.14s)]
*  And certainly, this would be good [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=297.24s)]
*  news for him. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=298.8s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=299.74s)]
*  All right, Elaine Cobb, thank you [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oymwvKu98&t=300.5s)]
