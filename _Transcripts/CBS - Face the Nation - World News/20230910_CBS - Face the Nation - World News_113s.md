# President Biden met with Vietnam's leaders as part of effort to "counter China in this region"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM)
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=0.0s)]
*  We want to turn now to senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=2.32s)]
*  who is traveling with the president in Hanoi, Vietnam. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=6.16s)]
*  Ed, this is a quick trip, just 24 hours, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=9.28s)]
*  but it's part of President Biden's strategy to counter a rising China. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  That's right, Margaret. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=16.12s)]
*  The president met this evening with the top leaders of Vietnam, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=17.32s)]
*  who are seeking what they call a comprehensive strategic partnership now with the United States, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=21.76s)]
*  a relationship that would put the US on par with China and Russia, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=26.0s)]
*  and that White House officials hope means eventually Vietnam will end up buying even more US military equipment [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=29.76s)]
*  as the Biden administration seeks to counter China in this region. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=35.56s)]
*  The stop here in Hanoi comes after the president made a visit to the G20 summit in India on Saturday. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=39.56s)]
*  There was a lot of conversation about topics of concern for the president, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=45.08s)]
*  climate change, economic development and infrastructure spending. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  There was also a joint statement from the leaders of the G20 that expressed general concern [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  about the suffering of the people of Ukraine, but no stronger denunciation of the war there. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=56.92s)]
*  That's in part because, of course, Russia and China are members of the G20, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  and India is officially neutral on the war. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  Still, the White House is pleased that there was any mention at all of the situation in Ukraine. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=68.52s)]
*  And the visit comes amid new CBS News polling that shows tough criticism for the president when it comes to foreign policy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=73.0s)]
*  Fifty percent of Americans believe he is making the United States weaker around the world. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  Fifty-seven percent believe he's being too easy on China. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=83.6s)]
*  And seven in ten Americans have a pessimistic view on the prospects for world peace. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  The visit here in Vietnam will end Monday with a stop at the memorial to the site [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=91.92s)]
*  where former Senator John McCain was shot down over the skies of Vietnam. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=95.56s)]
*  And on his way home to Washington on 9-11, he'll commemorate the terrorist attacks [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=99.68s)]
*  with a stop and a visit with troops in Alaska. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=104.2s)]
*  Margaret. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=108.04s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe with the president in Hanoi, Vietnam. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBg6khRvdM&t=109.16000000000001s)]
