# What to expect at U.N. General Assembly as it kicks off in New York City
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU)
*  The United Nations General Assembly kicks off its high-level week today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=0.0s)]
*  Roughly 140 world leaders are gathering in New York City to discuss a variety of issues, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=4.0s)]
*  including the wars in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=9.44s)]
*  President Biden, Vladimir Zelensky, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  are all slated to speak this week. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=17.2s)]
*  Biden's speech tomorrow will likely mark his final major appearance on the world stage. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=19.6s)]
*  Let's bring in Samantha Vinograd. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=24.96s)]
*  She is a CBS News national security contributor who formerly served as the Assistant Secretary [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=26.479999999999997s)]
*  for Counterterrorism and Threat Prevention at the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=32.32s)]
*  Sam, good to see you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=36.8s)]
*  First of all, can you talk to us about the security in New York City to secure such an event? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=37.68s)]
*  Well, this is the most complex security event that the U.S. federal government deals with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=42.8s)]
*  in any given year. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=48.08s)]
*  The crime situation in New York, the counterterrorism situation in New York, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  is complex to begin with. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=53.12s)]
*  And we now have over 140 world leaders and their delegations in New York City [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=54.72s)]
*  with their own unique set of respective security threats. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=60.72s)]
*  And that is why the UN General Assembly has been designated what is called [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=64.4s)]
*  the National Special Security Event. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=68.96s)]
*  That means that the U.S. Secret Service, who's been in the news a lot lately, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  is in charge of the overall coordination and planning for securing the UN General Assembly. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=74.8s)]
*  The Federal Aviation Administration has shut down airspace over New York City. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=80.88s)]
*  The U.S. Coast Guard has prohibited activity in the East River. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=84.88s)]
*  And there's a joint operation center with the FBI, the UN Safety and Security Office, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=88.72s)]
*  as well as connectivity to the State Department, DOD, and Foreign Security Services [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=95.36s)]
*  to gather intelligence, to conduct surveillance, and if necessary, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=100.8s)]
*  to respond to any threats that may arise. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  A fascinating peek behind the curtain of how to secure such an event like this. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=106.64s)]
*  Let's talk about the meat and potatoes of this week. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=110.0s)]
*  How will the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=113.2s)]
*  shape some of the speeches we're going to hear? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=116.08s)]
*  Well, the UN Secretary General has already said that his word of the week is compromised. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=117.68s)]
*  There is a deep hope by UN leadership, as well as many world leaders, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=122.08s)]
*  that there will be some sort of compromise that could lead to an end in fighting in the Middle East. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=126.0s)]
*  On Ukraine, it is not likely that we are going to see any material shift by Russia, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=130.64s)]
*  not only because Vladimir Putin hasn't showed up at the General Assembly since 2015. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=135.36s)]
*  He's sending his foreign minister, and there's unlikely to be much movement there. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=139.68s)]
*  Now, the UN Security Council is holding a special briefing on Ukraine to discuss the situation there, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  but it is unlikely we're going to see much movement. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=149.6s)]
*  Where I do think we'll see action is in what we call the bilats, the bilateral meetings. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  There is a formal program of speeches that kick off tomorrow, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  but the meetings on the margins of the General Assembly [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=159.84s)]
*  between world leaders that we don't actually get to listen to or take part in [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  is likely where we'll see the more substantive discussions. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=167.92s)]
*  I want to know about that. What happens in those meetings? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=170.55999999999997s)]
*  Well, many of them are scripted. I've been in my fair share. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=173.92s)]
*  But there is typically a set of agreed-upon topics, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=177.44s)]
*  and we should expect in some of these meetings, both for President Biden [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  and for his Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, we should see a push on high-level negotiations [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=184.0s)]
*  on Israel-Gaza, Israel-Lebanon, and ostensibly on more support for Ukraine. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  We should expect that President Biden and Tony Blinken in their meetings [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=196.0s)]
*  to speak with allies, for example, about what could actually shift the tide of the war in Ukraine, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=200.24s)]
*  what additional authorities and resources are needed, and more. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=206.0s)]
*  Before you go, the FBI just released its 2023 crime report this morning. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=209.44s)]
*  It shows violent crime dropped between 2022 and 2023. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=214.24s)]
*  We know this has come up in some of the campaigning and some elections, how safe people feel. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=217.6s)]
*  What do the numbers show us? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=222.72s)]
*  Well, it has come up. Mr. Trump has indicated that crime is through the roof. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=224.16s)]
*  But the FBI crime statistics do tell a different story. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=228.32s)]
*  The FBI crime statistics show that after a surge in violent crime, particularly in homicides during [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=231.76s)]
*  2020, last year we saw a 3% decline in violent crime overall. So in summary, Lindsay, violent [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=237.76s)]
*  crime is declining in this country after a surge in 2020, in particular homicide, rape, and other [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=245.92s)]
*  forms of violent crime. Now, interestingly, motor theft was up last year, but overall, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=252.64s)]
*  particularly in large municipalities, big jurisdictions, we have seen a continued [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=257.2s)]
*  downward trend in violent crimes in this country. Samantha Vintergrad, thank you so much. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtZqod8-bU&t=263.03999999999996s)]
