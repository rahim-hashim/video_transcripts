# South Korean president lifts martial law after parliament votes for overturn
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE)
*  Following a developing situation in South Korea, their president has lifted martial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=0.0s)]
*  law he imposed after the parliament defied him by voting to overturn it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=5.08s)]
*  It began when President Yoon Suk-yul made an unannounced address to the nation declaring [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=10.16s)]
*  martial law while accusing his political opposition of sympathizing with North Korea. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=15.64s)]
*  Following the order, the military announced political gatherings would be suspended. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=21.38s)]
*  Despite that, enough members of parliament were able to meet and vote to block the martial [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=25.88s)]
*  law decree. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=30.56s)]
*  Charlie Daggett joins us now from the Pentagon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  Charlie, thank you for making time for us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=34.12s)]
*  Can you walk us through how we got to this moment and what has happened since the martial [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=36.16s)]
*  law was ordered? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=40.76s)]
*  Weijia, nice to see you again. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  It has been a tumultuous day. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  The night ended in South Korea with the South Korean president declaring martial law. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=48.04s)]
*  It took everybody by surprise. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=53.5s)]
*  It took South Korea by surprise. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=55.8s)]
*  Obviously, North Korea took the Pentagon, State Department, White House. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  Nobody was expecting this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  And it was real, that martial law went into effect immediately. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  And as you said, banning protests, any kind of political dissent, taking control of the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=67.24s)]
*  media. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=71.84s)]
*  And it lasted for a fair few hours, because, yes, the parliament came in as many as could, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=72.84s)]
*  because this is late at night, early in the morning. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=76.88s)]
*  of 300-something came in by unanimous decision reversed that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=80.32s)]
*  But apparently under South Korean law, they may reverse it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  It's then up to the president to go ahead and accept that reversal. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=89.08s)]
*  And about six hours later, he said, OK, we'll agree to take that order back. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=93.72s)]
*  So but for, you know, a tumultuous six hours, the country was under martial law order. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  And this is a major ally, military ally of the United States. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  There are 28,500 troops there at bases throughout South Korea. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=110.68s)]
*  So this is something that the Pentagon was closely monitoring. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  I can tell you, Pentagon officials tell me that the mil-to-mil, as they call it, the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  South Korean military and the U.S. military were in constant communication throughout. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=123.84s)]
*  Yes, there's a lot of soldiers that live off base, but they would have had to adhere [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  to that curfew. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=132.96s)]
*  But as I said, this was late at night. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  By early morning, about six o'clock in the morning, that had been reversed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=135.68s)]
*  But you know, a tumultuous time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=139.16s)]
*  The North Koreans were looking at it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=140.72s)]
*  And this is a major U.S. ally in that region. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=142.84s)]
*  The State Department has also expressed their concerns. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=145.96s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=148.84s)]
*  We are watching the recent developments in the ROK with grave concern. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  We are seeking to engage with our Republic of Korea counterparts at every level. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=158.4s)]
*  Our alliance with the Republic of Korea is ironclad, and we're fully committed to that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=163.64s)]
*  And ultimately here, our hope is, and every hope and expectation is, that any political [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=174.24s)]
*  And Charlie, given the close allyship that you just laid out with South Korea, what role [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=180.64s)]
*  does the United States play when something like this unfolds? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=186.6s)]
*  Well, yes, of course, you know, South Korea is a diplomatic partner, but it isâ€”what [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  we would hope to be, what the United States would hope to be, is a stable democracy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=195.92s)]
*  But importantly, you have that U.S. military contingent there as well. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=201.16s)]
*  So I think in terms of what's going to happen to this South Korean president, you know, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=205.44s)]
*  it was described to me as a Hail Mary. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=209.72s)]
*  He was facing impeachment. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=211.64s)]
*  This is probably going to be quickened. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=213.04s)]
*  Yes, there needs to be a stable political democratic society. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  That needs to be a trading partner for the United States. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=219.2s)]
*  But as far as their concern here at the Pentagon, as far as the military's concern, you know, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=222.04s)]
*  we've got North Korea. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=226.52s)]
*  North Korea has acted belligerently in the past few months. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=227.92s)]
*  They want to keep those channels of communication open. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=231.88s)]
*  It's also worth noting that there's nothing to indicate that North Korea had changed anything [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=234.44s)]
*  in their posture in order to exploit the situation. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=239.18s)]
*  As far as the U.S. is concerned and the North Korean militaryâ€”sorry, excuse me, importantly, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=242.12s)]
*  the South Korean military is concerned, it's business as usual, and they're going to maintain [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  that sort of stability, whatever the sort of political upheaval happens in South Korea [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  itself. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=256.12s)]
*  All right, Charlie Dagata, thank you so much. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=257.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ60ssfZ1VE&t=260.08s)]
