# What to know about Wagner group head Prigozhin
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8)
*  Wagner group leader Yevgeny Prokosyan is actually wanted by the FBI here in the US for his efforts [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=0.0s)]
*  to meddle in the 2016 elections. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=6.4s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Deborah Pata has been tracking the Wagner group and she [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=9.52s)]
*  reports this morning from Johannesburg, South Africa. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=13.84s)]
*  Yevgeny Prokosyan's uprising appears to have been extremely well planned and executed. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=17.44s)]
*  Who would have thought one of Putin's closest allies, a former convict turned Kremlin caterer, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=23.12s)]
*  would eventually be pitted against the Russian leader? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=29.24s)]
*  It was during Russia's first invasion of Ukraine in 2014 that Prokosyan made the leap from [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=34.0s)]
*  Putin's chef to warlord, running an off the books mercenary group. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=39.36s)]
*  Wagner's soldiers started showing up in Syria, then across Africa. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=43.56s)]
*  And while his hired guns deal in death, Prokosyan makes his money by plundering natural resources [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  in places like the mineral-rich Central African Republic or CAR. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=55.04s)]
*  In exchange, Wagner provides the mercenary muscle to prop up the country's leader, even [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  guarding the president. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=65.4s)]
*  What Wagner doesn't say is that they effectively run this nation through violence and a galaxy [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=67.44s)]
*  of shell companies. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=73.92s)]
*  Now, this model is repeated across Africa, allowing Prokosyan to evade sanctions and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=74.92s)]
*  rake in billions to fund what the U.S. has called a transnational criminal organization, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=81.64s)]
*  as well as his private army in Ukraine. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=88.28s)]
*  Until recently, Prokosyan vigorously denied any links to Wagner, but stepped out of the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=91.2s)]
*  shadows last year, recruiting prisoners from Russian penal colonies in exchange for pardon [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=97.08s)]
*  and at salaries far higher than any regular Kremlin soldiers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=104.48s)]
*  And he certainly enjoyed the notoriety, filming himself strutting around the battlefield and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=109.96s)]
*  delivering Putin his only real victory after months of war, capturing Solidar and Bakhmut [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=115.44s)]
*  at a heavy cost, though, as many of his mercenaries were killed in that fighting. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  Now, throughout this war, Prokosyan has appeared untouchable and has survived even after this [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=127.88s)]
*  armed insurrection, and he seems convinced, Margaret, that at the very least he will continue [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=135.0s)]
*  his reign in Africa, the real Wagner money spinner. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=141.92s)]
*  Deborah Pada, thank you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70TAoVCgo8&t=147.56s)]
