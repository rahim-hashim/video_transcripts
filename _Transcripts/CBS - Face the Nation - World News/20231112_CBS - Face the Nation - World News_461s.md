# President Herzog says Israel is "doing our utmost according to international humanitarian law"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc)
*  We turn now to the president of Israel, Isaac Herzog, who joins us from Jerusalem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=0.0s)]
*  Good afternoon to you, sir. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=6.92s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=9.36s)]
*  Your country lost 1,200 of its civilian citizens on October the 7th, and I know you're still [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=12.26s)]
*  reeling from that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=20.02s)]
*  But what we're seeing in Gaza right now with Hamas and this concentration of very intense [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=22.2s)]
*  fighting around Al-Shifa Hospital, if that is indeed Hamas' command center, does that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=29.44s)]
*  mean this war ends if you take control of it? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=36.96s)]
*  Well, the war we've taken on against Hamas is a war which matters to the entire well-being [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  and safety of the world, I would say. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=49.0s)]
*  And therefore, our main aim at this stage following the atrocities we've gone through [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=52.16s)]
*  on October 7th is to uproot the capability of Hamas. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=57.04s)]
*  It doesn't end in Shifa Hospital. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=61.32s)]
*  They're based all throughout Gaza. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=63.76s)]
*  I know you have personally met with many of the families of the roughly 240 hostages being [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=65.64s)]
*  held by Hamas and other terror groups. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=70.64s)]
*  Can you explain why Israel is reportedly now considering releasing Palestinian women and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=75.36s)]
*  your prisons in exchange for some of these hostages held by Hamas? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=82.74s)]
*  I don't want to give any illusions. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=88.97999999999999s)]
*  Qatar is trying to mediate, so is Egypt. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=92.02s)]
*  In order to get a humanitarian release of some of the hostages, we demand all the hostages. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  That's the worldwide demand. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  But there are talks, of course, behind the scenes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=105.74s)]
*  I cannot confirm any details. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  What I can say is that there is nothing substantial right now on the table. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=111.18s)]
*  The United States is also heavily involved in this, so there's nothing tangible that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=116.30000000000001s)]
*  I can report. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=120.58000000000001s)]
*  I ask because in the past, Israel has flatly refused that Hamas proposal to release Palestinians [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  from prison. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=128.62s)]
*  Are you saying that's a false report? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=130.74s)]
*  It's not the same. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=133.22s)]
*  It's not the same. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=134.62s)]
*  The report doesn't say that Israel is willing to release murderers who are sentenced for [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=135.86s)]
*  life sentence. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=142.18s)]
*  In my speech in Congress to a joint session of the House in July, mid-July, I said that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=143.5s)]
*  the entire problem with the peace process in the region is terror. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=151.06s)]
*  Terror is undermining the entire ability to move forward. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  All of those who remember decades of trying to make peace with our neighbors know that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=159.46s)]
*  we can make peace with those who adhere to the agreements and fight terror. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=164.18s)]
*  Unfortunately, a nation which supports and hails terror cannot be a partner. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=169.66s)]
*  We've seen the atrocious results. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=175.26000000000002s)]
*  I understand the United States of America considers Hamas to be a terrorist organization [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=177.9s)]
*  and has for decades. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=183.10000000000002s)]
*  They're very clear on that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=184.62s)]
*  But as you just mentioned, you have long been an advocate for peace with the Palestinians. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=186.9s)]
*  But there are many in the current government who before October 7th were not and do not [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=192.46s)]
*  favor two states for two people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=198.9s)]
*  Do you still believe that is the way ultimately to have peace? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=202.66s)]
*  Why would anybody agree right now to any progress with our neighbors when we don't see truly [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=207.5s)]
*  their ability to fight terror? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=214.38s)]
*  including those in Gaza are hailing and smiling and celebrating in the most atrocious way [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=218.3s)]
*  the world's greatest atrocity almost since World War II. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=225.02s)]
*  May I also add and tell you that part of the whole issue is that it's kind of a culture [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=230.46s)]
*  that celebrates these awful atrocities. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=236.58s)]
*  These atrocities cannot be accepted in any way. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=240.66000000000003s)]
*  It means it has nothing to do with the conflict. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=245.14s)]
*  It has nothing to do with the borders, with settlements or anything. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=248.1s)]
*  This is simple, simple, clear barbarism, Jew hate, other hate, which is advocated by ISIS, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=251.78s)]
*  Hamas al-Qaeda, which if we weren't here, then Europe will be next. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=259.1s)]
*  And probably the United States is the end game for all of them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=264.06s)]
*  I understand. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=268.42s)]
*  And I'm not discounting in any way anti-Semitism around the globe, which is on the rise when [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=269.62s)]
*  it comes specifically, though, to the long term security of the Democratic and Jewish [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=276.06s)]
*  state of Israel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=281.02s)]
*  It sounds like you have lost some hope for that peace process. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=283.38s)]
*  But I wonder, given what you are seeing happen in Gaza right now and the wish you have for [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=288.38s)]
*  security for your people, aren't you concerned that more individuals will be radicalized [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=295.54s)]
*  by the level of civilian casualties right now? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=301.5s)]
*  If we eradicate the capabilities of Hamas, we'll give hope to the Palestinians in Gaza [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=305.5s)]
*  too, to run their life decently, as we've expected in the accords we had with the Palestinians. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=312.1s)]
*  We enabled the Palestinian Authority to take control of Gaza, and they lost it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=318.94s)]
*  They lost it to a brutal coup of Hamas in 2007. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=324.94s)]
*  But the issue is, I kept on asking President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority on numerous [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=329.14s)]
*  occasions, would you go in if Israel takes Hamas out? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=334.85999999999996s)]
*  And he said no. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=338.94s)]
*  Now I don't know exactly where he's at and if they're even capable of doing so. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=340.29999999999995s)]
*  But one thing is clear. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=344.85999999999996s)]
*  We first and foremost have to give safety and security to Israel. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=346.02s)]
*  Understood. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=350.98s)]
*  Even the United States government says that death toll of 11,000 Palestinians may be an [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=351.98s)]
*  undercoup. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=357.38s)]
*  They say they can't separate civilians from Hamas fighters, but it's still a tremendous [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=358.38s)]
*  amount of death. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=363.54s)]
*  So given that, how can you say with certainty that Israel's military and intelligence is [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=365.78s)]
*  hitting the right targets right now? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=371.7s)]
*  That the dying that is happening is necessary and helpful to your security? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=375.18s)]
*  I thank you for this question. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=381.66s)]
*  First of all, because I want to express my utter pain and sorrow for any innocent casualty [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  on the Palestinian side. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=389.58s)]
*  We are doing our utmost according to international humanitarian law. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=391.38s)]
*  First and foremost, we alert people. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=395.3s)]
*  I mean, what's the story here? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=397.06s)]
*  The enemy, these terrorists fought and tried to kill us and send missiles and terrorists [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=399.14s)]
*  from their homes. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=405.09999999999997s)]
*  So we have to go to these homes and we have to blow up all their infrastructure, tunnel, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=406.53999999999996s)]
*  missiles, everything. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=411.3s)]
*  So we go and we send leaflets and we call and we phone and we send text messages to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=412.62s)]
*  all the civilians in that area. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=418.5s)]
*  We tell them move out. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=420.74s)]
*  We give them time to move out. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=421.82s)]
*  And we've opened humanitarian corridors and we have increased dramatically the humanitarian [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=423.7s)]
*  aid to those who are moving out to a safety zone. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=428.65999999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately, there could be casualties. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=432.97999999999996s)]
*  Some of them are also by Hamas fire and the reporting and the numbers are unclear to me. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=435.7s)]
*  But but I'm saying outright, we are doing our best. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=441.38s)]
*  Unfortunately, these things happen and we are sorry for it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=444.82s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we have to uproot that infrastructure because we have to defend [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=448.58s)]
*  ourselves according to our right and duty to defend our people. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=454.09999999999997s)]
*  President Herzog, thank you for your time. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nna01WueULc&t=457.82s)]
