# War in Gaza shows no signs of slowing in 2025
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk)
*  The war in Gaza is showing no signs of slowing down in 2025. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=0.0s)]
*  CBS News' Holly Williams has the latest on the conflict. Holly. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=4.0s)]
*  In the Gaza Strip, there is no end in sight. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=8.0s)]
*  In the first three days of the new year, over 100 people have been killed, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=12.0s)]
*  according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=17.0s)]
*  2024 saw Israel not only continue to pummel Gaza, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=19.0s)]
*  but take aim at its enemies across the Middle East. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=23.0s)]
*  Israel decimated the leadership of Hezbollah in Lebanon [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=27.0s)]
*  and traded direct missile fire with Iran after decades of shadow war. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=31.0s)]
*  And in recent weeks, it seemed that Israel has the Houthis in its sights. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=36.0s)]
*  It is another Iranian proxy in Yemen that's launched missiles and drones at Israel. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=40.0s)]
*  Some believe Israel is trying to fundamentally reshape the Middle East [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=46.0s)]
*  and may have contributed to the toppling of the Syrian regime last month [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=50.0s)]
*  Iran and Hezbollah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=55.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, talks on a hostage and ceasefire deal are restarting in Qatar. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=57.0s)]
*  Around 100 hostages are thought to remain in Gaza, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=61.0s)]
*  mostly abducted during the October 7 attacks, although many are believed to be dead. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=65.0s)]
*  The death toll in Gaza after nearly 15 months of war is now over 45,000, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=70.0s)]
*  according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=76.0s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=78.0s)]
*  Holly Williams, thank you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7_xuasbKyk&t=79.0s)]
