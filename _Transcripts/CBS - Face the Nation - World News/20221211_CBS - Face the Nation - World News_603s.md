# Family of Emad Shargi, American held in Iran, urges Biden to do more to secure release
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E)
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=0.0s)]
*  The release of Brittany Greiner from Russia is putting focus on other Americans held hostage [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=6.48s)]
*  abroad, including Imad Shargi, who has been detained in Iran since 2018. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=11.48s)]
*  He was sentenced without trial to 10 years in prison. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=17.04s)]
*  Joining me now is his wife, Bahre Shargi, and their two daughters, Ariana and Hannah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=20.84s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=26.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=27.68s)]
*  Thank you for having us here, Margaret. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=28.68s)]
*  I know it's never easy to talk about this, but it's important. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=30.6s)]
*  There has been a lot that has happened since we last spoke inside Iran and with these hostages [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=33.96s)]
*  released. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=39.24s)]
*  Bahre, what was your reaction when you heard that Brittany Greiner was released? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=40.24s)]
*  I was ecstatic for Brittany and her family. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=46.2s)]
*  Brittany should have never been detained. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=51.0s)]
*  And I was very, very happy that she's back home. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=53.68s)]
*  And it also gives me hope because it means that this can be done for others, such as [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=57.4s)]
*  my husband and other Americans who are held in Iran. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=63.04s)]
*  So it's hopeful for you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=67.68s)]
*  Yes, yes, very much so. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  Ariana, you know, when Brittany Greiner was released, her agent issued a letter and it [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=70.92s)]
*  stood out to me because they said they will try to help families like yours. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=76.76s)]
*  In fact, they named Imad in the list of those who are wrongfully detained, held for being [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=81.08s)]
*  American. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  They also listed Murad Tabaz, Fiamak Namazi, who has been detained seven years now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=87.04s)]
*  He was left behind when the U.S. and Iran traded prisoners back in 2016. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Do you find that all of you working together is making a difference? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=97.4s)]
*  I definitely think so. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we are all a part of this terrible club that no one wants to be a part of. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  But it's been really incredible to have this family of hostage families of Americans held [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=109.96s)]
*  abroad. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=117.08s)]
*  And I do think that us helping each other makes a huge difference to get the word out, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=118.08s)]
*  but also for this amazing support system that we've developed. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=122.36s)]
*  So I do really sincerely appreciate the fact that Brittany is going to advocate for other [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  hostages held abroad. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=135.48s)]
*  Anything we can all do together, I definitely think is more powerful than just one family [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=137.12s)]
*  advocating for their own loved one. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=142.0s)]
*  Hannah, I know when we all last spoke back in June, you were all publicly asking for [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=143.88s)]
*  a meeting with President Biden and with White House officials. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Have you gotten one? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  We have not received a meeting with him. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  We've been asking as a family, along with the other hostage families, to meet with him [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=159.0s)]
*  for quite some time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=163.96s)]
*  I just don't understand why he isn't meeting with us. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  I think it would make a big difference to sit down with him. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=169.28s)]
*  I want to tell him about my dad. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=172.08s)]
*  I want to tell him how scared we are, how pressing this matter is and how time sensitive [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=173.56s)]
*  it really is. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, our father could have been killed in the Evian fire. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  This is a fire at a prison where your father's being held back in October. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=183.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=187.16s)]
*  So there was a fire and the riots at the prison where he is being held. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=188.16s)]
*  We didn't hear from him for two days. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  We didn't know if he was alive or not. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=195.32s)]
*  He inhaled tear gas and smoke from the fires. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=198.12s)]
*  And it just shows that this is a really pressing issue and there's really no time to wait. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  We don't know really what's going to happen day to day. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=208.16s)]
*  So I just want to sit down with the president and tell him our story and ask that he does [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=213.04s)]
*  everything he can to bring our dad home. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=217.78s)]
*  I mean, we live in Washington, D.C. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=219.92s)]
*  We'll come anytime he has available for us. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=222.04s)]
*  Did you receive any response from the White House to your public calls? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=225.32s)]
*  We did. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=228.76s)]
*  We wrote as the families, Iranian families, the Iranian-American families to the president. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=229.76s)]
*  And we did get an acknowledgement of the letter. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=235.8s)]
*  But that was it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=239.3s)]
*  I have seen no signs. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=240.84s)]
*  It's just been talk, but nothing really to show us that he's doing anything or his administration [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=242.6s)]
*  really to bring Ahmad and the other Americans home. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=249.36s)]
*  You know, Ariana, with the prisoners in Iran, this is a really tough situation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=253.12s)]
*  The U.S. nuclear talks with Iran appear to be crumbling. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=260.04s)]
*  You have Iran now helping Russia and Ukraine. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=265.04s)]
*  For the White House, does it raise a risk by meeting with you? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=269.56s)]
*  Do you think there's a good reason for them not to meet with you? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=274.32s)]
*  Or do you feel like you're being treated differently? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=278.32s)]
*  Frankly, I don't think there's a good reason not to meet with us. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=281.64s)]
*  I mean, we're Americans, first and foremost, before even just being a hostage family. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=285.72s)]
*  But also, if Biden and his administration could have the courage and the fortitude to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=294.12s)]
*  get Britney out of Russia while Russia is in a war with Ukraine, then I don't see any [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=306.28s)]
*  reason why they shouldn't be able to get my dad out of Iran. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=312.67999999999995s)]
*  It's clear that they have the skills and the tools to make these difficult negotiations [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=316.0s)]
*  and to make the hard but correct decisions. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  Secretary Blinken in the State Department has to handle a lot of these issues. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  Have you been in communication with them? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=331.23999999999995s)]
*  Are they more forthcoming? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=333.52s)]
*  I think the State Department has been great. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  We talk to them often and they have, I know they have done a lot to bring our father home. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=339.56s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think what we really need is the White House to be more [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=346.76000000000005s)]
*  involved. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=351.24s)]
*  That is really where the decision is going to come from. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=352.24s)]
*  At the end of the day, the president has the authority to make these kinds of big decisions. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=354.24s)]
*  And that's really who we need to speak with now. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  I've asked Secretary Blinken in the past, he says these issues are so important to him. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=365.48s)]
*  He carries a card in his pocket with the names of the hostages. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  But as he likes to say, the other side gets a vote. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=374.0s)]
*  Do you get the sense that there is a deal to be made and that there's a choice not to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=376.8s)]
*  take it? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, do you have any sense of where the diplomacy is or any progress within that? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we have always asked and hoped that the issue of the JCPOA and our father's release [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=388.56s)]
*  are separate. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=395.88s)]
*  The nuclear deal? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=396.88s)]
*  The nuclear deal, yes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=397.88s)]
*  But as of now, we have seen no plan to bring our father home. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=398.88s)]
*  That's what I'd really like to see. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=403.6s)]
*  Someone say this is the plan, we are going to execute it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  But it seems that at the moment there is no clear and concise plan to actually bring my [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=408.44s)]
*  dad and the rest of the Americans home from Iran. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=414.16s)]
*  You tweeted the other day, a pretty powerful tweet, because the White House press secretary, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=417.71999999999997s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre, was asked by a reporter about your dad on the day Brittany Greiner [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=422.12s)]
*  was released. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=428.32s)]
*  And she said she wasn't familiar with the case. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=429.52s)]
*  You said it was crushing, absolutely crushing to hear that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=432.12s)]
*  Yes, it was definitely hard to hear that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=436.44s)]
*  She did not know my father's name. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=439.68s)]
*  She was not familiar with the case and deferred us to the State Department. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=442.03999999999996s)]
*  Once again, she was asked the same question in June and also said that she was not familiar [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=446.76000000000005s)]
*  with his name or the case. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  And I just don't understand how I should have faith that my dad's going to be home if the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  White House doesn't even know his name. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=459.0s)]
*  You know, diplomats I talked to say they are working on this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=463.08000000000004s)]
*  It is just a very, very difficult situation. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=465.68s)]
*  But you just want your husband home. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=469.64000000000004s)]
*  How is Imad? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  How is he doing? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=473.40000000000003s)]
*  What do you know about his state? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  Imad is not well. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=477.04s)]
*  We are not well. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=479.56s)]
*  Imad is thousands of miles away from us. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=481.04s)]
*  He's an innocent American being held hostage for no good reason at all. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=484.8s)]
*  Again, like Hannah said, and we don't hear of any plan, particular plan of how he will [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=490.76000000000005s)]
*  be brought home. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=496.8s)]
*  Again, with everything going on, with the fire, with the protests, Imad is at risk every [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=498.8s)]
*  single day, every single moment. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=506.28s)]
*  They all are the hostages in Iran. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=509.47999999999996s)]
*  And we just we just don't know why the administration doesn't use all the tools they have and the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=512.56s)]
*  president to just encourage the administration to do what is the right thing. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=519.16s)]
*  We are behind him. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=525.36s)]
*  I hope that we ask all the American people to be behind the president to help support [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=526.76s)]
*  bring Imad and the other Americans home. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=533.48s)]
*  As for you, this is not at all political. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=536.36s)]
*  No, you just want your dad back. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=538.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=540.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=541.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is a it's a humanitarian humanitarian issue at the end of the day. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  It's not a political issue. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=545.56s)]
*  These are Americans and they just deserve to be home with their families. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=547.48s)]
*  So it's it's not political, really. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=550.56s)]
*  It's just it's about people at the end of the day. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=552.8s)]
*  And we're coming up on the fourth or fifth holiday season without him. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=555.88s)]
*  Fifth. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=560.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=561.36s)]
*  And it is it is on the way here, actually, I was telling the girls, oh, wouldn't it be [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=562.76s)]
*  fun to go get a Christmas tree this weekend or today or something? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=567.12s)]
*  And it just wouldn't be fun. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=570.76s)]
*  And we have not gotten it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=572.36s)]
*  And we are waiting for Imad to come. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=573.96s)]
*  And it happens that, in fact, December 24th is also our anniversary and yet another anniversary [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=576.24s)]
*  to be spent where Imad is in jail. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=582.48s)]
*  And I am here. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=586.12s)]
*  So we just want Imad back home. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=587.48s)]
*  Well, we wish you the best of luck with that. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=591.88s)]
*  And we will keep following your story. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=594.56s)]
*  Thank you so much for talking about your dad and your husband. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=596.84s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you so much. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6slskZ0vW4E&t=600.52s)]
