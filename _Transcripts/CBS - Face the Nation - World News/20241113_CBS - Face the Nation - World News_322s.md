# What Trump's Cabinet choices indicate about his foreign policy agenda
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. President-elect Trump has already named [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=0.0s)]
*  several people for key positions in his new and still developing administration. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=3.6s)]
*  This of course has generated a surge in speculation about what these selections [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=8.16s)]
*  do or don't mean for a second term foreign policy agenda. Ravi Agrawal is [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  joining us now to make sense of it. He is the editor-in-chief of Foreign Policy [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=18.56s)]
*  Magazine. I'm a subscriber so it's great to have you with us. My pleasure. Ravi [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=22.32s)]
*  what's your sense so far of the names mentioned or identified by the Trump [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=27.2s)]
*  transition team in the national security foreign policy space? So identified is a [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=33.16s)]
*  good word because there's some disagreement about whether they've been [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=38.44s)]
*  confirmed or not. They are all loyalists. If you look at the key positions that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=41.46s)]
*  have emerged there is Elise Stefanik potentially the UN ambassador, Mike [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=47.24s)]
*  Walls from Florida who would be the national security advisor. As you know [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=53.44s)]
*  NSA has become a very powerful figure in US foreign policy partly because of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=58.64s)]
*  just proximity to the president's office. Defense secretary we've learned that it [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=65.4s)]
*  is a Fox News anchor named Pete Haggart. He of course has served in the military. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  All of these figures what they have in common is they've been very clear about [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=77.52s)]
*  their loyalty to President Trump on many issues that others have diverged whether [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=82.64s)]
*  it is January 6th and the insurrection or the fealty to the America first [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=88.6s)]
*  ideology. These three have not wavered. Right they have been in lockstep. A broad [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  question for you Ravi if you please how does the rest of the world view this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=99.32s)]
*  momentous political event in America with fear or with anticipation? A bit of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=104.12s)]
*  both. If you are in Europe then you are scared. If you are part of the old world [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=110.88s)]
*  that relied on alliances that relied on the post Bretton Woods international [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=117.24s)]
*  order the rules based order. If you are from the world that likes the fact that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=122.36s)]
*  the head of the IMF is always European and the head of the World Bank is always [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=127.8s)]
*  American then you're very worried because Donald Trump is not going to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=131.56s)]
*  care that much about alliances. He cares a lot more about bilateral relations. He [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=136.36s)]
*  sees especially economics in terms of what am I getting out of it. He is more [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  bilateral than multilateral. And transactional in a way that steps [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=146.8s)]
*  around or openly disdains multilateral institutions. Exactly he is not just [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=151.72000000000003s)]
*  transactional at some level all of us transact. He is nakedly transactional [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=157.52s)]
*  and here's the other side of the equation there are many countries [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=162.44s)]
*  around the world that are not scared of a transactional American president in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=166.76s)]
*  fact that is what they want. So if you are for example Kenya or India or [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=171.24s)]
*  Indonesia or South Africa or Nigeria you might look at that and say actually I [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=176.6s)]
*  want more transaction I don't want an American president who's going to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=182.0s)]
*  lecture us about democracy promotion or human rights and is going to challenge [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=185.72s)]
*  us in those fronts we want to do deals so bring on the deals. So it is a mixed [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=191.2s)]
*  picture I think we tend to sort of reflexively imagine that every country [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  on earth is looking at a Trump presidency and is worried about it. It [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=200.28s)]
*  actually opens up opportunities for many countries. It has been observed already [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=203.72s)]
*  Ravi that with Mike Huckabee named ambassador to Israel, Elise Stefanik to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  UN that President-elect Trump is already clearly demonstrating that his will be a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=212.56s)]
*  pro-Israel but also pro-Netanyahu American government. How does that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=218.56s)]
*  simplify or complicate things in the Middle East? Well in some senses look [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=223.68s)]
*  Biden was also very pro-Israel in many respects so you may not see much [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=228.72s)]
*  divergence on that front in terms of trend lines Trump is more pro-Israel. I [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=235.16s)]
*  don't think he cares as much about human rights so you know whether the casualty [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=240.4s)]
*  toll in Gaza or Lebanon is something that he's going to shed a tear over. What [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=247.4s)]
*  about annexing Gaza or expanding settlements in the West Bank? Very [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=251.52s)]
*  possible I mean Mike Huckabee has been quite open on that front about not [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=254.84s)]
*  really caring about those those areas using the old sort of Israeli terms for [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=259.64s)]
*  them Judea and Samaria instead of the West Bank so those things I think would [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=265.36s)]
*  be immediately worrying signals for Arab countries less so for Israel of course [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=270.52s)]
*  but Iran is an area that could be very interesting to see what happens you know [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=276.12s)]
*  among some of the names who've been mooted as potential national security [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=280.36s)]
*  officials and a Trump administration there's a wide range of people who go [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=284.96s)]
*  from thinking you know in the America first tradition of not wanting to be [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=289.24s)]
*  embroiled in foreign conflicts but you have all the way to the other end of the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=294.12s)]
*  spectrum people who actually are arguing that you know the United States should [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=297.66s)]
*  help Israel go all the way now and attack Iran's nuclear facility so [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=301.88s)]
*  there's a big divergence in optionality. Settle many of the remaining unsettled [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=306.48s)]
*  scores in the region. Absolutely. If they can. Ravi Agrawal, Foreign Policy, it's great to have you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=311.56s)]
*  I hope you'll come back because this conversation will not end here and now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=316.48s)]
*  Thanks so very much. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbFzQkaospE&t=320.48s)]
