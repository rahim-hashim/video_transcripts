# Fiona Hill and John Sullivan on Russia and Ukraine
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw)
*  We're now joined by Dr. Fiona Hill, a Trump administration National Security Council advisor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=0.0s)]
*  on Russia and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, who is now a CBS News contributor. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=4.98s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=11.26s)]
*  Good to have you both here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=12.26s)]
*  Thanks, Fiona. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=13.26s)]
*  Fiona Hill, I'd love to talk to you first. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=14.26s)]
*  Secretary Blinken admitted Russia's not isolated. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=18.22s)]
*  It's getting support from China. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=21.86s)]
*  It's getting support from Iran. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=23.62s)]
*  So does that mean the West's main tool here, sanctions are failing? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=25.82s)]
*  Well, I think sanctions was never the only tool that we had. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=30.0s)]
*  I mean, diplomacy as well as the military support for Ukraine. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=33.44s)]
*  And I think, you know, what we heard from Secretary Blinken and, you know, the fact [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=35.88s)]
*  that he's just been at the Munich Security Conference underscores that we're going to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=38.84s)]
*  have to really up our diplomatic game because, you know, as you're suggesting here, a lot [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=42.24s)]
*  of other countries just don't buy that there's as big an issue as we see with Russia's invasion [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, they're always making comparisons with, you know, the great power competition [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  among the United States and Russia and China and seeing it as part of that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  And I think, you know, what Secretary Blinken and other members of the administration have [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=60.0s)]
*  been really striving to get across is that it's not part of that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=64.28s)]
*  So the United States isn't fighting over Ukraine for any kind of competition with China and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=67.44s)]
*  with Russia. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=73.44s)]
*  They're trying to help Ukraine liberate itself. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=74.44s)]
*  That's the message that we have to get across. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=76.28s)]
*  And frankly, if Russia gets away with a land grab in Ukraine, it makes the world unsafe [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=78.36s)]
*  for every country imaginable that has a territorial dispute, including, of course, all of the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=83.61999999999999s)]
*  neighbors of China in the South China Sea and East Asia and many other countries as [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=87.97999999999999s)]
*  well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=92.46s)]
*  India and China have a major dispute in the Himalayas, for example. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=93.46s)]
*  And what we really have to do is to work with those middle powers, the countries in the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=96.38s)]
*  UN General Assembly, to make that point that we're trying to help Ukraine liberate its [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=100.41999999999999s)]
*  territory from an unprovoked aggression. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=105.58s)]
*  Ambassador, you heard from the Polish prime minister this concern that not just the black [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=108.38s)]
*  glass radius from this conflict, but that there will be some pushing of it beyond borders, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=113.58s)]
*  maybe not over invasion, but destabilization. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  When you were in the administration, you left in September, there was talk about the surrounding [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=123.2s)]
*  countries also being targeted by Russia. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=128.94s)]
*  Do you think that's underway now? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=132.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=133.68s)]
*  I mean, we've seen the story earlier this week about a potential effort by the Russians [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=134.68s)]
*  to undermine the government in Moldova. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=140.4s)]
*  We've seen overflights by Russian missiles that were attacking Ukraine, that have gone [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=142.84s)]
*  over the territory of other countries that aren't parties to the conflict. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=146.9s)]
*  But this is a longstanding concern by Poles, by Eastern Europeans, that have always felt [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=150.36s)]
*  threatened by that colossus on their eastern border by Russia. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  They've always described it to me as when I was deputy secretary, they felt that they [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=159.88s)]
*  were on the front lines against this imperialist Russian state. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=165.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=170.58s)]
*  But this feels different. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=171.78s)]
*  When you were here with us, last time you said, when you talked to Secretary of the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=173.72s)]
*  Union of Poland in February 19th of last year, he asked you, how are you feeling? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=178.1s)]
*  You said it feels like August 1939. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=182.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=185.22s)]
*  You just said the Polish prime minister invoked Hitler. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=186.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=189.06s)]
*  So what happened on February 24th last year, Putin pushed all of his chips to the center [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=190.06s)]
*  of the table. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=195.18s)]
*  He went all in. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=196.18s)]
*  You'll recall before February 24th, there was speculation about, yeah, there'll be maybe [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=197.3s)]
*  a limited incursion into Ukraine. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=203.22s)]
*  Putin went all in. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=205.70000000000002s)]
*  He went full World War II, World War I scale. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  This is war, and we're going all in. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=211.02s)]
*  We're going to take down the Ukrainian government. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=212.86s)]
*  We're going to subjugate the Ukrainian people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=215.06s)]
*  And by God, we're going to do with Ukraine what we wish, because Ukraine isn't a country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=217.3s)]
*  Ukraine is part of our Ruski Mir. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=222.62s)]
*  We're going to do with it what we want to. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=224.58s)]
*  And you, the United States, you, NATO, anybody else, you can't stop us. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=227.78s)]
*  And he's betting on a short attention span here in the West, here in the United States. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=231.70000000000002s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is set to give an address Tuesday. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=236.18s)]
*  It's going to be his first state of the nation since the war began. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=239.34s)]
*  Very same day, President Biden is going to give a speech in Poland. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=242.70000000000002s)]
*  What's the message you expect and should be delivered? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think what Putin is going to deliver is a message that picks up on what Ambassador [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=249.42s)]
*  Sullivan's just said. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  He's going to depict this as a great patriotic war. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=255.85999999999999s)]
*  You know, they use interchangeably fatherland war, protection of the motherland. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=258.46s)]
*  In this case, Putin has been actually trying to say that this is the third invasion of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=262.86s)]
*  Russia after Napoleon and the Napoleonic Wars back in the 1800s and then Nazi Germany. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=266.98s)]
*  So he's actually portraying this as an existential threat for Russia. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=273.18s)]
*  So what we would imagine is that he's really trying to mobilize the Russian population [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=277.1s)]
*  in support of what he's depicting as the fight for their lives. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=281.98s)]
*  Now, President Biden is going to have to counter that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=285.22s)]
*  We have to counter that narrative, not just in Europe. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=287.58s)]
*  And, you know, as we've heard from the Polish prime minister, we've heard from many other [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=290.58s)]
*  European leaders, they do see things in the same term as a rerun of World War I and World [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=294.82s)]
*  War II in the sense of an unprovoked aggression by a great power in Europe. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=299.74s)]
*  But they've got to basically, and President Biden's got to convince the world, the whole [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=304.26000000000005s)]
*  world at this point, not just Europeans, that we're in a fight to help Ukraine liberate [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=308.14000000000004s)]
*  itself and that everything that Putin is saying is a distortion of history and a fact. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=312.38000000000005s)]
*  Ambassador, when you talk about the war in Ukraine politically here in the United States, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=317.26000000000005s)]
*  President Biden gets attacked by Republicans in particular for being too slow moving to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=323.3s)]
*  approve certain types of weapons. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  Air jets, for example, for a year have been debated about whether to give them or not. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=329.82s)]
*  Is this too slow moving if we are actually in this incredibly important moment? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=335.62s)]
*  Well, it is an incredibly important moment, and I think some of the criticism has been [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=340.14s)]
*  fair. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=344.54s)]
*  It has been, I think the administration, of which I was a part until recently, has been [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=345.54s)]
*  a little slow, has been cautious. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=349.62s)]
*  President Biden, the marching orders we got at the start of this conflict was he wanted [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=352.02s)]
*  to do everything we could to support Ukraine, but he didn't want a war with Russia. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=357.66s)]
*  And that's the careful balancing act that we've, with the administration, has been [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=361.82000000000005s)]
*  going through. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=364.98s)]
*  But Vladimir Putin doesn't want a war with the United States either. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=365.98s)]
*  Vladimir Putin says he's already at war with the United States. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=368.46000000000004s)]
*  He says the reason that he invaded Ukraine is that Ukraine, put up to it by the United [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=371.1s)]
*  States, was going to invade Russia. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=376.0s)]
*  Ukraine was going to develop nuclear weapons. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=378.26000000000005s)]
*  The United States and Ukraine were developing bio weapons. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=380.26000000000005s)]
*  The times that he will use the word war to discuss what's happening in Ukraine is when [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=383.3s)]
*  he says the West, the United States and all of its vassals, the word they use, is actually [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=388.22s)]
*  at war with Russia. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=393.64s)]
*  When he talks about the special military operation, that's the response by Russia to the war that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=395.44s)]
*  the United States is already waging through its Ukrainian proxies, as they say the United [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  States wants to fight against Russia to the last Ukrainian, and it's all made up. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=405.66s)]
*  And those are the words you're going to be listening for on Tuesday. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=411.21999999999997s)]
*  He's going to absolutely, Fiona's absolutely right. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=413.34s)]
*  It's going to be rallying the Russian people to support the fatherland in this, what he [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=417.34s)]
*  considers existential war that he's engaged in, in Ukraine. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=425.3s)]
*  Dr. Hiltman, Ukraine's foreign minister said at Munich, the true end to the war will be [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=429.34s)]
*  when Russia's president comes to Kiev, falls to his knees and begs for forgiveness. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=434.06s)]
*  That does not sound like Vladimir Putin. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=438.84s)]
*  No, but perhaps 90 years from now, some Russian president might do that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FIKyzPmGuw&t=440.86s)]
