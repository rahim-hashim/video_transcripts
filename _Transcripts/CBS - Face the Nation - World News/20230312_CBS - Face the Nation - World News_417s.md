# "Russian-linked cyber criminal" is possibly behind Congress data breach, Christopher Krebs says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [March 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o)
*  And turn now to Chris Krebs, who is former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=0.0s)]
*  Security Agency. He's also a CBS News expert and analyst. It's good to have you here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=4.64s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=10.8s)]
*  Before we get to what's happening with the Silicon Valley Bank, I want to ask you about [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=12.48s)]
*  what has happened with this data breach. We learned on Wednesday that certain members [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=17.44s)]
*  of the House and Senate were told personal data, including like home addresses and Social Security [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=21.6s)]
*  numbers, was taken from a D.C. health insurance provider. It's like 56,000 people. And then that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=26.64s)]
*  information is being sold online. Who's behind this? So a cyber criminal known as Intel Broker, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=33.6s)]
*  and it's not clear immediately who that person is, where they live. But they have been involved in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=40.4s)]
*  previous data breaches and attempting to sell information on certain dark web markets. And [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=46.72s)]
*  the point here is that you steal the information and someone buys it and then they can monetize it [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=53.76s)]
*  through fraud and identity theft and things like that. So Intel Broker has previously claimed that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  they had access to U.S. federal agencies. This is a different case, though, where they've actually [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=64.8s)]
*  taken information, they put it online, and made it available for sale. FBI was able to get in and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=70.32s)]
*  buy some of this information. It's not clear if by buying that information it was deleted on the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=77.68s)]
*  other end. But that's what happens in this very, very vibrant cyber criminal ecosystem. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=83.2s)]
*  So what more does the U.S. government need to do to protect, you know, I mean, some of these staffers [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=90.56s)]
*  and lawmakers are at risk here. How do you protect against that? And is this a state actor? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=95.76s)]
*  Is there any involvement? You know, it's not again, it's not clear who the actor is. It's a cyber [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=102.16s)]
*  criminal. It's very possibly a Russian linked cyber criminal. Russia allows a very pervasive [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=106.48s)]
*  environment and permissive environment for cyber criminals. It actually helps the kind of broader [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=111.68s)]
*  Russian strategic objective to undermine confidence in the U.S.'s ability to protect citizens. It [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=116.64s)]
*  actually brings a significant amount of revenue into Russia. But what happens next is kind of the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  question. So for one, some of the markets where Intel Broker was selling this information, they've [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=128.4s)]
*  actually deactivated the Intel Broker account reportedly. In part because these markets don't [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=133.76000000000002s)]
*  want undue attention. They don't want the FBI coming in and shutting it down. So they try to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=139.84s)]
*  stay below the radar. Same kind of thing happened after the Colonial Pipeline breach that we spoke [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=144.32s)]
*  about about a year and a half, two years ago. So what will happen now is if the information is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  available for sale, who buys it? Yeah. Likely again fraudsters, but also possibly security [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=154.48s)]
*  services of our adversaries that are looking to get information on members of Congress for building [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=160.64s)]
*  their own portfolios and dossiers. Political operatives could buy it for opposition research [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=166.88s)]
*  and other purposes. But the hope is that by kind of shading them out of the market and the FBI's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=171.84s)]
*  disruptive operations, they can ensure that this is not weaponized. This is not information that's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=177.92s)]
*  used for nefarious purposes. You talk to tech companies and startup companies, I know. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=183.04s)]
*  A number of the businesses that had their accounts or loans with Silicon Valley Bank [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=189.12s)]
*  are very worried right now. They don't have access to cash, even just to pay employees. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=194.64s)]
*  What are you hearing? Like what is the level of panic here? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  The biggest challenge right now, I think these companies, and again it is 50% [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=206.55999999999997s)]
*  of VC backed US companies, ventricle banked with Silicon Valley. It's approximately 60,000 companies. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=211.11999999999998s)]
*  The challenge they're having right now is that they don't have access to information [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=218.48s)]
*  in addition to access to their money. I've talked to a number of companies that are banked with SVB, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=222.88s)]
*  with Silicon Valley Bank, and they've not heard anything over the weekend. Here's the challenge [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=227.6s)]
*  though. Most companies issue payroll on the 15th and the last day of the month. The 15th is Wednesday. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=232.16s)]
*  To make payroll on this upcoming Wednesday, you have to have that money in the bank tomorrow to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=240.32s)]
*  process. By not having access to information, what money they will have access to tomorrow to process [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  payroll, they're now lining up alternative sources of funding. In some cases, we're seeing [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=250.96s)]
*  predatory loans. It would be very helpful, as Congressman Conner pointed out, if we could get [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=256.72s)]
*  some clarity on the situation and as the secretary mentioned, some guarantees for those depositors [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=261.76s)]
*  in place today. If a deal comes through today and access to funding is open tomorrow, that's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=269.52s)]
*  fantastic, but we've got to have some certainty. These company executives need information. They [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=275.04s)]
*  need clarity on what's happening so they can take care of their employees or otherwise. We're going [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=280.8s)]
*  to see furloughs next week in the tech industry. You heard the treasury secretary say we are in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=285.12s)]
*  touch or through the FDIC are in touch with depositors, but you are also saying publicly [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=290.32s)]
*  there needs to be clear statements of confidence to shore things up. You didn't get that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  We're not getting that right now. I think this is again what Congressman Conner was talking about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=302.0s)]
*  with the speed of Twitter. Information travels so quickly. Yes, you can have runs on the bank, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=305.76s)]
*  but you also need to get that information out there in the hands of the 60,000 companies [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=311.2s)]
*  that are banked there, over 250,000 FDIC insured limits so that they can also communicate to their [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=315.2s)]
*  employees. No one wants to miss a paycheck, and there are millions of employees with paychecks [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=321.92s)]
*  at stake next week. I did think it was interesting because as some have said to me, these are [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  medium-sized, small companies, startups. This isn't big bad Wall Street. It's a little bit [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=335.36s)]
*  more politically easy to convince the public if you want to step in and help smaller businesses, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=341.92s)]
*  but what's happening there with the politics of this? Well, in part, I think that most of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=350.32s)]
*  your viewers probably hadn't even heard of Silicon Valley Bank until Thursday night, Friday morning, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=356.8s)]
*  but this really is the economic engine of the United States of America. This is the innovation [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=361.2s)]
*  engine. This is a lot of the future, that tech competition that we talk about with China and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=365.76s)]
*  others. This is where it's happening. These are the front lines. We really need to ensure [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=369.76s)]
*  that the depositors, again, not the shareholders in the bank, but the depositors in the bank have [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=373.84s)]
*  certainty so we don't see further runs on tech-friendly banks next week going to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=379.84s)]
*  systemically important banks. We really need this diversity in the banking system so we don't [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=386.4s)]
*  concentrate risk at the top and have a much more fragile banking industry. The next few hours [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=391.35999999999996s)]
*  may be key, and we'll be watching for any update on that. I know we've heard the Israeli Prime [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  Minister spoken on this, the British finance secretary has spoken on this, now the Treasury [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=404.96s)]
*  secretary. We'll see what comes together in the next few hours. Chris, good to have your analysis. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=411.28s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKI7iTb-3o&t=416.47999999999996s)]
