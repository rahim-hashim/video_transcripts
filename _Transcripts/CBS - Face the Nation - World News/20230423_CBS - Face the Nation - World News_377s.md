# Sen. Chris Coons says it's a "temporary suspension" of U.S. embassy in Sudan
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q)
*  We go now to Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who joins us from Wilmington, Delaware. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning to you, Senator. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=5.4s)]
*  I know you've said you feared this violence for the past few weeks, and it was this intense [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=6.76s)]
*  fighting between Sudan's armed forces and a paramilitary group that led to this dramatic [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=12.06s)]
*  evacuation. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  Do you think the U.S. should have pulled out sooner? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=19.54s)]
*  Well, Margaret, if I'd been on this show just two weeks ago, we wouldn't have been talking [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  about fighting in Sudan, because there wasn't any. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=26.7s)]
*  There were special envoys from the UN, the AU, the U.S., all negotiating with these two [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=29.98s)]
*  generals, General Khomeini, General Burhan of the regular army and the paramilitary. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=35.52s)]
*  I'm still hopeful that they could return to a civilian government. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=40.74s)]
*  It unwound fast in just the last week, and I'm grateful that our special forces have [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=44.88s)]
*  now successfully overnight evacuated the U.S. nationals who work in our embassy in Khartoum. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=50.86s)]
*  This is a temporary suspension. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=57.06s)]
*  It's my hope and theirs that we will be able to return to Khartoum and the situation will [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  stabilize. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=65.62s)]
*  But, Margaret, this is the same sort of thing that happened in Kyiv and Ukraine that has [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=66.62s)]
*  happened in other countries, in Yemen and Syria, where when the fighting gets intense [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  quickly, we rely on our special forces to evacuate U.S. nationals who staff an embassy [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=75.9s)]
*  in a country that descends into a war zone. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=82.42s)]
*  Well, I know you've been saying the country may tip into all-out civil war. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=85.32s)]
*  Russia and China have really been extending their influence throughout Africa, Russia [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=90.84s)]
*  in Sudan as well, including that paramilitary group, Wagner. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=95.74s)]
*  They have left behind hundreds of American civilians in Sudan who now don't necessarily [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  have a way out of the country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=109.06s)]
*  Are you concerned about how the United States can use some kind of leverage to help its [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=111.82s)]
*  citizens escape? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=117.96s)]
*  Well, Margaret, just a reminder that Sudan is a vast country. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=119.44s)]
*  It's the third largest country in Africa, a country of 45 million people spread over [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=123.46s)]
*  a huge amount of territory. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=128.48s)]
*  Yes, I am concerned about the safety and security of U.S. nationals who've been serving in humanitarian [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=130.12s)]
*  missions or in other ways across the country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  There are quite a few U.S.-Sudanese dual nationals in the country, and the U.N. and the U.S. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=139.42s)]
*  and a number of other countries will do their best to help return to civilian rule, to end [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=145.66s)]
*  the fighting, to support a stabilization in Sudan. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=152.11999999999998s)]
*  But as for right now, an evacuation through some overland convoy is the most likely path [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=156.11999999999998s)]
*  out for folks who work for the U.N. in the World Food Program, for example, who serve [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=161.54s)]
*  other countries in Khartoum and around the country, and for those remaining U.S. nationals [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=166.96s)]
*  who may wish to leave. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=171.84s)]
*  But does the U.S. have any leverage to stop the fighting? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  Just a reminder, Margaret, this is a country that for 30 years was under the brutal dictatorship [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  of Omar al-Bashir. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=183.16s)]
*  It was on the state sponsor of Terrorism List. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=184.8s)]
*  We don't have deep relationships with the Sudanese military or with the paramilitary [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=186.84s)]
*  force, the RSF. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  We have some leverage in that we provide development assistance, humanitarian relief, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=194.46s)]
*  but frankly, these two warring factions have started what may well be a fight to the finish, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=199.54000000000002s)]
*  and we may have limited leverage in the next couple of weeks and months as they carry out [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=205.38s)]
*  a fight to see who will ultimately be in control of the security of Sudan. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  And that is why there's so much concern. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=214.82s)]
*  I want to ask you as well about your position on the Judiciary Committee. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=217.10000000000002s)]
*  CBS interviewed earlier this week an attorney for an IRS agent who is seeking whistleblower [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=222.1s)]
*  status from Congress to share information he says would contradict sworn testimony to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=228.4s)]
*  Congress by a senior political appointee regarding the investigation into Hunter Biden. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=235.1s)]
*  Do you think it's worth looking into the possibility of undue influence here? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  Look, anyone who comes forward and seeks whistleblower protection status should be given that status. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=245.5s)]
*  That's part of what we've put in place over many years, a system that allows career folks [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=251.62s)]
*  who work in different federal agencies the chance to blow the whistle and testify if [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=257.94s)]
*  they see something wrong. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=262.46000000000004s)]
*  I'll remind you, nothing's been presented yet. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  This person hasn't come forward in any detail. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=266.76s)]
*  If and when they do, if there's any substance to it, I expect that the chairman of the Judiciary [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=269.7s)]
*  Committee, Dick Durbin, and the ranking member will ensure that they are fairly and appropriately [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=274.7s)]
*  treated. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=279.5s)]
*  Are you confident in the conduct of Attorney General Merrick Garland when it comes to this case? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=280.5s)]
*  I am. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=285.94s)]
*  Look, President Biden from the days he was campaigning to his first days as president [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=286.94s)]
*  made it clear that he thought restoring the independence of the Department of Justice, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=291.9s)]
*  removing any political influence for potential investigations was a core value that he brought [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=297.58s)]
*  to this service as president. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=303.94s)]
*  I'm confident that that's in no small part why he chose a seasoned circuit court judge, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=306.26s)]
*  someone with also deep experience at DOJ. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=312.53999999999996s)]
*  I am confident that Merrick Garland has conducted himself appropriately here. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=314.82s)]
*  CBS reported back in October that the FBI gathered evidence sufficient enough to charge [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=319.06s)]
*  Hunter Biden with tax and gun related crimes and sent it to the U.S. attorney in Delaware. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=324.3s)]
*  And we know that in the coming days, Mr. Biden's attorneys are set to meet with the U.S. attorney [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=330.42s)]
*  in Delaware. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  Do you have any sense if this is going to conclude soon? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=337.46000000000004s)]
*  It's been ongoing since 2018. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=341.06s)]
*  No, I don't, Margaret, nor should I. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=342.94s)]
*  It is an ongoing investigation that, as you say, has been conducted for years. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=345.94s)]
*  The U.S. attorney here in Delaware is the U.S. attorney who was appointed by the previous [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=350.82s)]
*  administration. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=355.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=356.26s)]
*  And look, if there are any charges ever brought, we'll discuss them at that time. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=357.26s)]
*  I think this is a long-going federal investigation, which I hope will reach a conclusion at some [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=362.78s)]
*  point soon. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=369.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=370.26s)]
*  Senator Coons, thank you for joining us this morning and giving us your perspective. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=372.06s)]
*  Thank you, Margaret. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4RoQ4ij9Q&t=375.92s)]
