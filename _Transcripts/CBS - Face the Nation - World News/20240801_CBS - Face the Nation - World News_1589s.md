# Biden says "their brutal ordeal is over" after Americans released in massive prisoner swap
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE)
*  This is a CBS News special report. I'm John Dickerson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=0.0s)]
*  Breaking news. Four Americans have been released from Russian custody in one of the largest [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=4.96s)]
*  prisoner swaps since the Cold War. Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=10.24s)]
*  Alsu Kuramacheva and Vladimir Karmerza were part of a seven-country 24 prisoner swap. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=15.92s)]
*  And in a moment, President Biden will deliver remarks on their release. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=22.56s)]
*  All participants were traded at one time on a tarmac in Turkey. Eight prisoners are being [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=26.8s)]
*  returned to Russia. Whelan has been in Russian custody since December 2018, a total of 2,043 days. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=33.2s)]
*  He was convicted of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison and held in a labor camp. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=41.76s)]
*  Gershkovich was arrested in March 2023 and convicted of espionage charges. He's been detained [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=47.2s)]
*  for 491 days. Russian-American journalist Alsu Kuramacheva was also released after nearly a year [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=53.68s)]
*  in Russian custody. The 47-year-old, who works for the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=61.84s)]
*  was convicted of spreading false information about the Russian army. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=67.44s)]
*  Here now, we expect President Biden to make it to the podium. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=72.24s)]
*  And we'll just wait for a moment. But in the interim, let's bring in our Chief White House [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  correspondent, Nancy Kortes, who is at the White House. Nancy, the president issued a statement [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  today. What do you make of what he highlighted in it? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=89.92s)]
*  Well, I can tell you a little bit of what he had to say, John. He said that the deal that secured [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=92.88s)]
*  the freedom of three Americans and one legal resident was a feat of diplomacy. All told, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  he said, we've negotiated the release of 16 people from Russia, including five Germans [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=104.8s)]
*  and seven Russian citizens. He went on to say that he will not stop working until every American [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=110.72s)]
*  wrongly detained or held hostage around the world is released. And he added that his administration [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=116.8s)]
*  has now brought home over 70 such Americans. John. Nancy, the shot we can see is just of a podium, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=122.4s)]
*  but what we can't see is all the people who are in the room. Who is expected? There's supposed to be [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=129.6s)]
*  some family members in there, yes? Correct. The president will be surrounded by the families [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=134.4s)]
*  of Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. In Paul Whelan's case, these are family members who [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=140.0s)]
*  have been awaiting his return for nearly six years. They themselves have put out a lengthy [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=146.88s)]
*  statement, John. It is three and a half pages long in which they celebrate his return. They say he [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  was held hostage for 2043 days. His case was that of an American in peril, they said. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=160.24s)]
*  And they added that the first years in captivity were the most difficult. They say those first [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=168.08s)]
*  years were hard when the Trump administration ignored Paul's wrongful detention and it was [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=173.84s)]
*  media attention that helped to finally create the critical mass and awareness within the U.S. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=179.52s)]
*  government. And it was really his family, John, that stoked that media attention. They did [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=185.6s)]
*  endless interviews trying to keep his story in the public eye even as he was passed over [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=191.12s)]
*  in multiple prisoner swaps, including the swap that brought home Trevor Reed, the one that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  brought home Brittany Griner. He was not included, which was extremely painful for his family. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=202.0s)]
*  And Nancy, as we wait here for the president to make his way to the podium, I wonder what you made [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  of in his statement. The president said this is a powerful example of why it's vital to have [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=211.52s)]
*  friends in the world whom you can trust and depend on. Our alliances make Americans safer. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=216.0s)]
*  That is a core belief of this president. Correct. And what he's talking about specifically there, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=221.28s)]
*  John, is the fact that the Russians insisted for months, if not years, that any prisoner swap [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=226.8s)]
*  that would bring home these individuals would have to include Vadim Krasikov, who's being held in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=233.36s)]
*  Germany. And Nancy here now, President Biden. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=239.6s)]
*  Good afternoon. And this is a very good afternoon. A very good afternoon. Today we're bringing home [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  Paul, Evan, Alsou, Vladimir, three American citizens and one American green card holder. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=257.44s)]
*  All four have been imprisoned unjustly in Russia. Paul for nearly six years, Vladimir since 2022, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=264.79999999999995s)]
*  Evan since March of 2023, and Alsou since October of 2023. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=273.52s)]
*  Russian authorities arrested them, convicted them in show trials, and sentenced them to long prison [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=280.0s)]
*  terms with absolutely no legitimate reason whatsoever. None. Paul, a former Marine, was [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  in Russia for a wedding. Evan, a journalist with a Russian in Russia, was in Russia, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=293.36s)]
*  signed by the Wall Street Journal. Alsou, also a journalist, was in Russia to see family. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  All three falsely accused of being spies. And Vladimir was a Russian citizen by birth [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  and holds an American green card. He's a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and was [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  a pallbearer of my friend John McCain's funeral with me. He spoke out against Putin's regime, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=317.76s)]
*  and for that he was convicted of treason. And now their brutal ordeal is over, and they're free. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=324.32s)]
*  Moments ago, the families and I were able to speak to them on the telephone from the Oval Office. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=332.88s)]
*  They're out of Russia. Earlier today, they're flown to Turkey. And soon they'll be wheels up on [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=340.0s)]
*  their way home to see their families. This is an incredible relief for all the family members [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=345.6s)]
*  gathered here. It's a relief to the friends and colleagues all across the country who have been [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  praying for this day for a long time. The deal that made this possible was the feat of diplomacy [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=356.64000000000004s)]
*  and friendship. Friendship. Multiple countries helped get this done. They joined the difficult, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=363.6s)]
*  complex negotiations at my request. And I personally thank them all again. And I thank [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=370.32s)]
*  them personally and I thank them again. All told, Russia has released 16 prisoners. Eight Russians [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=376.56s)]
*  who are being held in the West will be sent home as well. These 16 prisoners from Russia [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=383.28s)]
*  that Russia has released include four Americans, five Germans, seven Russian citizens who are [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=389.76s)]
*  political prisoners in their own country. One of those Russians runs a human rights organization, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=395.36s)]
*  Memorial, which won a Nobel Prize in 2022. Putin threw them in prison for voicing opposition to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=401.76s)]
*  the war in Ukraine. Four others worked with Alexei Navalny, a political oppositione who died in Russia [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=408.56s)]
*  prison this year. Now they can live safely abroad and continue their work of advocating for democracy, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=415.92s)]
*  if they so choose. This deal would not have been made possible without our allies. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=423.44s)]
*  Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, and Turkey, they all stepped up and they stood with us. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=428.88s)]
*  They stood with us. And they made bold and brave decisions, released prisoners being held in their [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=434.88s)]
*  countries who are justifiably being held, and provided logistical support to get the Americans [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=441.28s)]
*  home. So for anyone who questions whether allies matter, they do. They matter. And today is a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=446.24s)]
*  powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world, friends you can trust, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=454.32s)]
*  work with, and depend upon, especially on matters of great consequence and sensitivity like this. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=459.44s)]
*  Our alliances make our people safer. And we begin to see that again today. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=466.0s)]
*  Let me say this. It says a lot about the United States that we work relentlessly to free Americans [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=472.48s)]
*  who are unjustly held around the world. It also says a lot about us that this deal includes the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=479.2s)]
*  release of Russian political prisoners. They stood up for democracy and human rights. Their own leaders [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=484.64s)]
*  threw them in prison. The United States helped secure their release as well. That's who we are in [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=491.12s)]
*  the United States. We stand for freedom, for liberty, for justice, not only for our own people, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=497.12s)]
*  but for others as well. And that's why all Americans can take pride in what we've achieved today. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=504.4s)]
*  I want to thank everyone in my administration who helped make this happen. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=510.8s)]
*  Our work did not start just on day one. It started before day one. During the transition, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=515.2s)]
*  I instructed our national security team to dig into all the cases of hostages being wrongfully [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=521.84s)]
*  detained, which were inherently — well, we inherited them from the private — the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=526.8s)]
*  prior administration. I wanted to make sure we did the ground running, and we did. As of today, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=532.56s)]
*  my administration has brought home over 70 Americans who were wrongfully detained and held hostages [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=539.92s)]
*  abroad — many since before I took office. In addition, I issued an executive order in 2022 [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=544.8s)]
*  authorizing penalties like sanctions and travel bans on those who hold Americans against their [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=552.16s)]
*  will. And my State Department has introduced new warnings for Americans about the risk of being [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=558.16s)]
*  wrongfully detained by a foreign government. Deals like this one come with tough calls, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=564.24s)]
*  and there are never any guarantees. But there's nothing that matters more to me [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=571.6s)]
*  than protecting Americans at home and abroad. And so we'll continue to work for the release [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=576.16s)]
*  of all wrongfully detained Americans around the world. Let me end where I began, with Paul, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=581.84s)]
*  Evan, and Elsa, Vladimir, and their families. They never gave up hope. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=589.12s)]
*  We can't imagine what they've been through, all of you. As a matter of fact, this lady right here, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=596.24s)]
*  I think, was living in the Oval Office with us for a while. We're all kidding aside. We can't imagine [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=601.76s)]
*  their joy right now. They're home. Tomorrow is a big day. The 13th birthday of Miriam. Miriam, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=607.5999999999999s)]
*  where are you? Come here. You all know we have a tradition in the Biden family. We sing happy [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=615.92s)]
*  birthday — not only birthday — ready? All of you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=622.24s)]
*  Happy birthday, dear Miriam. Happy birthday to you. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=631.9200000000001s)]
*  Remember, no serious guys till you're 30. God love you. She's all Sue's daughter. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=638.24s)]
*  Now she gets to celebrate with her mom. That's what this is all about. Families. Able to be [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=646.6400000000001s)]
*  together again, like they should have been all along. I just want to thank you again to everyone [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=653.84s)]
*  who did their part. In just a few hours, we'll welcome home our fellow Americans. We're looking [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=659.2s)]
*  forward to that. God willing, we're going to be out at Andrews and get that done. So thank you. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=665.84s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. And this is a good day. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=672.1600000000001s)]
*  The Press. What did you say when they answered the phone on the other side? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=675.84s)]
*  The President. I said, welcome almost home. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=679.2800000000001s)]
*  The Press. How do you keep countries — these so-called abductor states — from simply taking [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=681.44s)]
*  more Americans in order to get more of their prisoners held? How do you end these perverse [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=688.8s)]
*  incentives, sir? The President. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=693.12s)]
*  By advising people not to go certain places. Tell them what's at risk, what's at stake. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=694.4s)]
*  The Press. What's your dream after — [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=700.24s)]
*  The Press. What are the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=701.4399999999999s)]

*  six countries to secure these reasons? The President. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=705.92s)]
*  Well, look, I'm not going to take the time now, but I'll do this later in the week. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=708.4s)]
*  I particularly owe a great sense of gratitude to the Chancellor. The demands they were making to [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=712.96s)]
*  me required me to get some significant concessions from Germany, which they originally concluded [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=725.2s)]
*  they could not do because of the person in question. But everybody stepped up. Poland [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=732.88s)]
*  stepped up. Slovenia stepped up. Turkey stepped up. And it matters to have relationships. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=738.4s)]
*  It really does. These things matter. The Press. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=744.16s)]
*  Could this improve relations with Russia? Is there any avenue for that after this [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=748.16s)]

*  As my sister might say, your lips to God's ears, man. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=755.52s)]
*  The Press. Would you be willing to speak with Putin now directly? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=758.72s)]
*  The President. I don't need to speak with Putin. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=764.56s)]
*  The Press. How did you weigh that decision of letting [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  somebody out who sounds like that way of working? The President. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=770.64s)]
*  I got home innocent people. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=774.56s)]
*  The Press. Are you speaking with everyone who are [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=775.92s)]
*  in the leaders' levels? Are you speaking with President [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=788.72s)]
*  Obama on the leaders' levels? The President. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=792.1600000000001s)]
*  I've spoken to all the leaders' levels. The Press. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=795.0400000000001s)]
*  What did you say about your father? The President. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=796.5600000000001s)]
*  By the way, as a father, look, you heard me say this before. I mean it. My dad is a simple [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=797.52s)]
*  proposition. Family is the beginning, the middle, and the end. Blood of my blood, bone of my bones. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  I can't think of nothing more consequential. I mean it sincerely. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=813.12s)]

*  circumstances were accidental, it matters. The Press. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=823.4399999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, what did Germany ask for in response for their cooperation? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=829.5999999999999s)]
*  The President. Nothing. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=833.28s)]
*  The Press. President Trump has said repeatedly that he could have gotten the hostages out [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=834.2399999999999s)]
*  without giving anything in exchange. What do you say to that? What do you say to President Trump now? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=840.8s)]
*  Former President. Why didn't he do it? He's President. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=846.24s)]
*  The Press. That's President Biden [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=848.4s)]
*  speaking at the White House after this extraordinary prisoner swap. Let's go now to Chief White House [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=855.12s)]
*  correspondent Nancy Cordes. Nancy, your reaction? Well, the President talked about how complicated [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=860.96s)]
*  this diplomatic feat was. And just to give you a sense, John, of how complicated it was, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=868.88s)]
*  it involved more than half a dozen countries, the U.S., Russia, Germany, Slovenia, Norway, Poland. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=874.24s)]
*  Detainees in all of these countries had to be released. And he talked about how grateful he [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=881.12s)]
*  was to the Chancellor of Germany. And here's why. Key to this entire deal was the release of Vadim [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=886.48s)]
*  Krasikov. He is a Russian who was serving a life sentence in Russia for murder, for killing a [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=893.52s)]
*  Chechen fighter. As President Biden noted, initially, Germany said it could not release him, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=899.6s)]
*  even though it was clear that Putin would not be releasing any Americans unless he got Krasikov back. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=905.6s)]
*  Eventually, Germany relented, but in exchange, they got 12 Germans back. And so Germany's [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=911.6800000000001s)]
*  involvement was key to this entire diplomatic feat that, you know, had fits and starts for over a year, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=919.52s)]
*  but has now gotten done. Praising there not by name, but the German Chancellor Olaf Schulz, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=928.08s)]
*  the president also saying anyone who questions whether allies matter, they do. And just finally, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=933.84s)]
*  Nancy, surrounded by — I mean, you've covered this, President. Those remarks you made at the [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=940.96s)]
*  end about family, blood of my blood, bone of my bones, surrounded there by husbands, fathers, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=946.08s)]
*  mothers, daughters, the family who every night wondered, prayed whether these — their loved [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=951.28s)]
*  ones would come home, an emotional moment. Right. I mean, this is a president who famously [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=957.68s)]
*  speaks to all of his grandchildren by phone every day. Family is very important to him. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=963.76s)]
*  And the family members who were surrounding him have been lobbying him, in some cases, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=969.68s)]
*  for years to get this done. The Whelan family was not shy about pushing this administration [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=976.08s)]
*  to work harder when Whelan was passed over multiple times in various prisoner swaps. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=982.1600000000001s)]
*  So you can imagine the sense of relief for not just the president, but this entire administration [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=989.36s)]
*  that they've now been able to bring him home. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=995.0400000000001s)]
*  MR. SCHIFF, The Washington Post, The Washington Post, The Washington Post, The Washington Post, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=997.44s)]
*  Thank you, Nancy. Senior Foreign Correspondent Elizabeth Palmer has been following the prisoner [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=997.9200000000001s)]
*  swap closely. Liz, what can you tell us about one of the key Russians released, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1001.76s)]
*  this Vadim Krasikov that Nancy just mentioned? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1006.8s)]
*  MS. PEPER, Well, he was a colonel — is a colonel — in the FSB, the Russia Intelligence Services. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1009.92s)]
*  And he sneaked into Poland using — sorry, into Germany in 2019 using false documents [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1019.36s)]
*  and waited in one of Berlin's most famous parks, the Tiergarten, for a Chechen militant, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1027.68s)]
*  Zemle Kangošvili, to come walking by. He — Krasikov was on a bicycle with a Glock pistol. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1036.0s)]
*  He rode past and killed Mr. Kangošvili. He was arrested by German authorities and sentenced to [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1044.08s)]
*  life for this assassination in 2021. And as Nancy said, the Germans have been very reluctant [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1054.32s)]
*  to give him up because the crime was so brazen and so serious. In fact, the German court pinned [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1060.96s)]
*  his orders on Vladimir Putin, saying that the assassination was state-ordered. Putin, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1067.52s)]
*  on the other hand, uses very different language. He's called Krasikov a patriot who simply [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1074.24s)]
*  liquidated a bandit. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1081.76s)]
*  Whew. You met, as I understand, Vladimir Karamouza, the Russian political activist. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1084.0s)]
*  What can you tell us about him? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1091.52s)]
*  Very brave man with a great fondness for the U.S. He has British citizenship, was educated [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1095.12s)]
*  at Cambridge, but he has huge ties with the United States, in particular working on human [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1101.36s)]
*  rights. He was an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and of President Putin. And in fact, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1107.36s)]
*  Senator John McCain thought so highly of him that shortly before the senator's death, he emailed [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1113.28s)]
*  Karamouza and asked him to be a pallbearer at his funeral, which indeed he was. He also [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1120.3999999999999s)]
*  kept writing about the Kremlin and Russia's terrible human rights record and abuses while [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1126.1599999999999s)]
*  he was in jail. And he won the Pulitzer Prize, John, for commentary for those writings from [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1131.6s)]
*  jail. He's always had his head above the parapet, and many people will be so proud and so delighted [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1137.9199999999998s)]
*  to have him home. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1145.1999999999998s)]
*  Elizabeth Palmer, for us in London. Thank you very much, Liz. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1146.6399999999999s)]
*  Let's bring in Olivia Gazza, CBS News, intelligence and national security reporter. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1149.1999999999998s)]
*  How did this go down? So complex. Give us a sense of that complexity. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1155.4399999999998s)]
*  Sure, John. Well, the U.S. officials that we've been speaking to have characterized these months [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1160.24s)]
*  long negotiations as the most complex in U.S. Russian history and even U.S. Soviet history, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1164.64s)]
*  when as we know, spy swaps hit a crescendo. And we're just now learning some of the details [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1171.36s)]
*  behind why that was the case. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1176.96s)]
*  Nancy, outlining for you more than six countries involved in making this swap. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1178.88s)]
*  We have three U.S. citizens and one legal permanent resident now coming home to the U.S. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1183.92s)]
*  12 German nationals or Russian political prisoners headed to Germany. And yes, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1189.12s)]
*  eight Russian nationals heading back to Moscow, among them a convicted murderer who Vladimir [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1193.84s)]
*  Putin had had his sights on for months. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1200.3999999999999s)]
*  We also know this involved multiple U.S. government agencies, the White House, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1203.04s)]
*  the State Department and the CIA, while U.S. officials tried to keep these conversations in [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1207.12s)]
*  diplomatic channels so as not to give credence to the Russian allegations that Evan and Paul [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1213.04s)]
*  and also were involved in espionage. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1218.32s)]
*  The Russians insisted that they be handled in intelligence channels, the so-called special [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1221.04s)]
*  channel that the CIA has used in the past in order to arrive at these negotiations. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1225.28s)]
*  We've learned Director Burns was directly dealing with his intelligence counterparts [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1231.2s)]
*  in order to keep the conversation going. And then senior officials at the CIA dealing with [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1236.08s)]
*  Russian intelligence services to get to an agreement. So there's so much more about the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1241.4399999999998s)]
*  involvement of the State Department and the White House and the constellation of other [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1247.68s)]
*  Western countries that have finally brought this deal to a close. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1251.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, you mentioned that constellation of countries and this complexity. You mentioned [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1254.0s)]
*  the CIA Director William Burns involved in this very secret operation. Meanwhile, he's also [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1258.3200000000002s)]

*  an hour before he dropped out of the presidential race with his counterpart in Slovenia. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1272.8799999999999s)]

*  person who was tending this through all these levels of complexity? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1285.12s)]
*  John, I think it was a multitude of officials and agencies. You also had Secretary of State [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1289.36s)]
*  Antony Blinken trying to pressure Sergey Lavrov into agreeing that this be kept into diplomatic [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  channels, but the Russians just saying, no, we want this handled through our special channel. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1299.84s)]
*  You have the special hostage envoy, Roger Carstens, who is dealing with families and [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1304.32s)]
*  providing support and information whenever it's not classified to the families who are [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1309.1999999999998s)]
*  so starved for information. And then, of course, you have all of the unknown officials who are [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1313.84s)]
*  handling the complicated logistics to bring it to this point. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  That's amazing. Thank you so much, Olivia. John Sullivan was U.S. Ambassador to Russia [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1321.6799999999998s)]

*  First of all, can you just give us a sense, you dealt with these kinds of complex diplomatic [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1333.28s)]
*  operations, just give us a sense of the level of complexity here and how did this not leak? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1339.12s)]
*  Well, thanks, John. It's great to be with you. Yes, this absolutely is a very complex deal. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1345.04s)]

*  Those were complex. Involving all these other countries and all these other detainees, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1361.8400000000001s)]
*  it's immensely complex. And any one portion of the deal that drops out may cost the whole thing [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1369.0400000000002s)]
*  to be removed from consideration. So it was very complex. And as Olivia said, it's involved [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1377.44s)]
*  the entire U.S. government, the intelligence community, FBI, Justice Department, State Department, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1385.6s)]
*  et cetera. Very complex and literally a big deal. Now, Mr. Ambassador, help me understand this. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1392.08s)]
*  The president was asked at the end of his remarks why this isn't basically an incentive for the [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1399.44s)]
*  Russians to just take Americans to get their Russians back. And the president said he would [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1405.2s)]
*  advise Americans not to go to certain places. Does that mean Russia and does that mean Americans [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1410.56s)]
*  shouldn't go to Russia at all? Absolutely. The travel advisory for Russia is at the highest [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1414.96s)]
*  level of warning. Do not travel. I tell friends and relatives, do not travel to Russia. Americans [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1420.48s)]
*  are at grave risk there. So this deal and today we should be focusing on the Americans who have [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1427.28s)]
*  been released and their families. I know, visited many times Paul Whelan while he was in prison in [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1433.28s)]
*  a labor camp in Russia. I entertained Vladimir Karamurza at the U.S. embassy several times. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1440.56s)]
*  But what's not mentioned in the president's remarks and what Americans are going to need [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1447.52s)]
*  to focus on in the future is the fact this is a government, the Russian government that considers [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1451.68s)]
*  itself at war with the United States. Putin will, the Russian government will continue to detain [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1457.28s)]
*  without cause Americans in Russia and use them to extract things or persons it wants from the [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1463.28s)]
*  United States. This will not stop that. This is not a sign of an improvement in U.S.-Russia relations. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1471.84s)]
*  This is, the way to think of this is there's, Russia thinks it's at war with the United States. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1479.52s)]
*  This is in effect an exchange of prisoners of war during a war. It is not a sign of an improvement [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1484.64s)]
*  in U.S.-Russia relations. And just very briefly Mr. Ambassador, how do nations compartmentalize [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1491.2800000000002s)]
*  then? As you mentioned it's a very tense situation between the U.S. and Russia and yet this was able [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1497.3600000000001s)]
*  to go through. How does that compartmentalization take place? Well the, as several of people have [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1503.5200000000002s)]
*  spoken on this report, the role of the families and keeping their loved ones who were detained [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1510.32s)]
*  in Russia front and center of our politicians in the United States or officials in the United States [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1516.3999999999999s)]
*  who feel that emotional tug to get Americans out, which is why I say it's important for us to [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1522.72s)]
*  celebrate today their release. But an autocrat like Putin doesn't have that same pressure to get [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1528.32s)]
*  Russians released from the United States. And the Russians that are being released, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1537.3600000000001s)]
*  they're convicted criminals. They're not innocents. An excellent point to keep us focused [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1541.76s)]
*  on celebrating today, which we will do. Former Russian Ambassador John Sullivan, thank you so much. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1547.52s)]
*  To recap, our breaking news. Four Americans are free from Russian prisons after a complex trade, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1552.8s)]
*  one of the largest since the Cold War. Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Gershkovich, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1559.1200000000001s)]
*  Alsu Kurumasheva and Vladimir Karamurza were part of a seven country 24 prisoner swap. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1565.84s)]
*  Our coverage will continue on CBS News 24 seven, your local news and tonight on the CBS Evening News. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1573.28s)]
*  This has been a CBS News special report. I'm John Dickerson in New York. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ictl26kDvE&t=1579.9199999999998s)]
