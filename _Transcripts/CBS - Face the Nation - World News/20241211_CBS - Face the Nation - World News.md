# Trump extends inauguration invite to Chinese President Xi Jinping
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg)
*  Sources have confirmed to CBS News that President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=0.0s)]
*  Xi Jinping to his inauguration next month. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=5.46s)]
*  Trump apparently extended the invitation shortly after winning the election. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=8.38s)]
*  For more, I want to bring in CBS News senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Jen, the president-elect has been highly critical of China. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=15.98s)]
*  He's threatened to raise tariffs by at least 60 percent on goods imported from the country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  So why would he extend this invitation to Xi? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=23.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=26.78s)]
*  So President-elect Trump has long thought that leader-to-leader relationships, these [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=27.78s)]
*  warm relationships that he thinks he can build with world leaders, actually helps him with [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=32.72s)]
*  dealmaking. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=37.900000000000006s)]
*  So he's always argued that he should be talking to these leaders, even the most difficult [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=38.900000000000006s)]
*  ones are the ones that have an adversarial relationship with the United States, including [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=44.22s)]
*  someone like Xi. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=48.58s)]
*  So he feels like the closer he can get to these leaders and the better relationship [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=49.92s)]
*  he can have, the more he can get done to advance his agenda. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=53.56s)]
*  So he's been saying publicly that he's been talking to Xi, that he said he's had communications [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=57.76s)]
*  with Xi. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=63.64s)]
*  So now we know that this was one of them. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=64.64s)]
*  Has a leader of a foreign nation ever attended a U.S. presidential inauguration before? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=67.6s)]
*  What would be the significance if he accepted? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=71.6s)]
*  This would be unusual. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=74.62s)]
*  As far as I know, no other foreign leader has attended one of these. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=76.44s)]
*  These are very choreographed, you know, American ceremonies on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=80.44s)]
*  State Department records dating to 1874 show that there has not been any world leader at [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=86.92s)]
*  these sort of events. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  So as far as I know, absolutely not. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=94.72s)]
*  This would be definitely a veer from protocol. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=96.97999999999999s)]
*  Has Trump extended the invite to any other foreign leaders? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=99.88s)]
*  Not that I know of. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  I know that inauguration officials are preparing for other foreign dignitaries to be at the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  inauguration or perhaps some of the festivities around the inauguration. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=109.0s)]
*  We know that world leaders have been trekking down to Mar-a-Lago, Trump's club down in Florida, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=114.04s)]
*  to kind of kiss the ring. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  We know that Argentina's Miele was there, Hungary's Orban, Canada's Trudeau. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=121.42s)]
*  Did Trump extend an invitation to them? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  I am not sure. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=129.76000000000002s)]
*  Trump likes to be a host. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=131.52s)]
*  So it wouldn't surprise me if he had. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=133.12s)]
*  So we'll keep digging on that one. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  Jen Jacobs, thank you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-na1Ytfljg&t=136.96s)]
