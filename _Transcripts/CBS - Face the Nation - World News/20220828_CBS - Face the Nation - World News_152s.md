# Ukrainian energy minister says "we were not far" from a nuclear disaster
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY)
*  We turn now to the war in Ukraine, where fears are growing over a potential nuclear disaster at Zaporozsa, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=0.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Deborah Pata has the latest. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=8.3s)]
*  There are fresh warnings of the risk of radioactive leaks at the Russian-occupied Zaporozsa nuclear power plant. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia have traded accusations of renewed shelling there this weekend. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=20.0s)]
*  And on Thursday, the plant was down to a precarious last resort when it was disconnected from the grid due to fire damage. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=25.3s)]
*  For more than 24 hours, the plant was operating on backup diesel generators. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=34.3s)]
*  Frankly, that is one step before the catastrophe. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=40.3s)]
*  Energy Minister Herman Halyshenko explained a constant electricity supply is critical for cooling down spent nuclear fuel and avoiding a disastrous meltdown. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=44.3s)]
*  If the backup generators fail, it sets in motion a chain reaction. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=56.3s)]
*  So we narrowly escaped nuclear disaster. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=71.3s)]
*  I would say that we were not far, not far. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=74.3s)]
*  Ukrainians living in the shadow of the reactors prepare for a worst case scenario. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=78.3s)]
*  And authorities are handing out iodine tablets to help protect against radiation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=83.3s)]
*  The minister is hopeful the United Nations nuclear watchdog will inspect the site early this week. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=89.3s)]
*  From our point of view, it's very important to create something like permanent mission. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=95.3s)]
*  Not just to come there to check and to leave. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=102.3s)]
*  It's been just over half a year since Vladimir Putin did the unthinkable and invaded Ukraine. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=106.3s)]
*  In the East, war-weary residents still wake up every day to a living hell. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=114.3s)]
*  They count the dead, clear the debris. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=120.3s)]
*  The Russians are torturing us, said Tetiana Sviahitsa. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=124.3s)]
*  We're exhausted by the endless shelling, but we are still alive. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=128.3s)]
*  As the war stretches beyond the halfway mark, Ukrainians are digging in their heels, prepared for the long haul. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=133.3s)]
*  Just today, a rash of explosions in the South and the East, which Ukrainian authorities claim destroyed Russian military bases. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMWt8sMCboY&t=140.3s)]
