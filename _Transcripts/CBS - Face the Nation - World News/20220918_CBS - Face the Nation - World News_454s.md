# Ukraine's top prosecutor says he's pursuing genocide case
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8)
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=0.0s)]
*  We are joined now by Andriy Kostin, the prosecutor general of Ukraine. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=5.94s)]
*  Good morning and thank you for being here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=10.34s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  We just saw our correspondent show some pretty horrific images of what is happening in your [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=13.9s)]
*  country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=19.68s)]
*  You keep a database of possible war crimes. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=21.02s)]
*  You have more than 30,000 documented. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=24.54s)]
*  How do you begin to sort through them and prioritize? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=27.62s)]
*  First of all, at the moment we have fixed 34,000 war crimes in Ukraine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=34.46s)]
*  When we are talking about prioritization, of course, the cases like we see today and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=45.46s)]
*  days before of war crimes committed in Kharkiv region, including the Izum, of course, such [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=51.98s)]
*  cases are our priority. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=59.3s)]
*  Nevertheless, we have a lot of cases which are still ongoing, which started in places [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=61.74s)]
*  like Bucha and Irpin. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=68.98s)]
*  And all of the shelling and destroying of all of civil objects in Ukraine are also fixed [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=72.24s)]
*  and then are also investigated. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=81.62s)]
*  So what we see now is, of course, the horrible amount of potential war crimes committed by [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=84.58000000000001s)]
*  Russian aggressor. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=94.34s)]
*  I would like to say even that what we see now is a system of Russian aggressor, what [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=96.26s)]
*  they do on the occupied territory. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=103.82000000000001s)]
*  And it seems that for me that whenever Russian army comes, they turn this place into new [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=107.78s)]
*  Bucha, as we see in Izum. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=115.78s)]
*  Your president was on this program in the spring in the wake of Bucha, where it was [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=118.14s)]
*  horrific, the images. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  He called that genocide. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=126.78s)]
*  Are you seeing evidence of genocide? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  Can you bring that case to a court? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=131.70000000000002s)]
*  We have a case on genocide in the office of the prosecutor general, and we are in all [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=135.22s)]
*  the time in communication with International Criminal Court and Prosecutor Hahn, because [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=142.38s)]
*  the International Criminal Court has also the authority to look at the genocide case. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=148.1s)]
*  So we understand that all of these facts put together will lead us to possible conviction [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=155.54s)]
*  in crime of genocide. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=163.54s)]
*  No sitting leader has ever been prosecuted for genocide. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=167.9s)]
*  Can you actually prove that Vladimir Putin authorized or knew all of what was happening [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=172.7s)]
*  under the command of his military? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=178.34s)]
*  Of course, it's not an easy way to prove this system of command responsibility from the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=181.34s)]
*  highest level. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=189.12s)]
*  But we understand at the moment that the crime of aggression is definitely, we know who is [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=190.86s)]
*  responsible for it, because the crime of aggression is the mother of all of these crimes, of war [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=198.82000000000002s)]
*  crimes, genocide, because without aggression there will be no other war crimes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  And for that reason, for the crime of aggression, the highest politically and military leadership [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=210.5s)]
*  should be prosecuted and should be punished. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=215.54000000000002s)]
*  This past week, the United States sanctioned the Presidential Commissioner for Children's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=219.06s)]
*  Rights, this is an odd title given what she's accused of, who has overseen the taking of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=224.62s)]
*  children and forcing them into Russia. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=231.62s)]
*  Your ambassador has put that number at 91,000. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=234.86s)]
*  There are reports that Secretary Blinken has cited that puts that number at 260,000 children [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=237.86s)]
*  taken from their families. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=244.86s)]
*  How many of these kids can be returned and can you prove that this is part of this pattern [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=247.42s)]
*  you're talking about of genocide and intent to destroy? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=253.32s)]
*  We definitely understand that the kidnapping can forcibly, moving of our children, of the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  future of Ukrainian nation, forcibly sent to Russia is, of course, from my point of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=266.09999999999997s)]
*  view, is an element of potential genocide. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=273.66s)]
*  I will tell you that at the moment we have more than 50 children, only 53, 55 children [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=278.66s)]
*  returned to Ukraine. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  Some of them now are in safe place in Europe. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=287.66s)]
*  But the number which we in the Office of Prosecutor General have is thousands and thousands of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=291.66s)]
*  children for which we have exact evidence that they were kidnapped and forcibly sent [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=298.66s)]
*  to Russia. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=306.26000000000005s)]
*  We identified now more than 5.5 thousand children who were kidnapped and sent to Russia because [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=307.66s)]
*  in our office we need to identify definitely. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=315.86s)]
*  Okay. And the United States is now pointing that figure, finger, excuse me, right at the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=319.86s)]
*  Kremlin. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=325.02000000000004s)]
*  I want to ask you about sex crimes and sexual assault and rape. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=325.5s)]
*  There have been some horrific accounts, women chained in basements, children who were attacked. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=330.5s)]
*  I don't even want to recite half of what I read yesterday. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=338.26s)]
*  Is rape a deliberate act of subjugation being used by Russia? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=342.26s)]
*  We saw it in Buche. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=348.26s)]
*  We know that these cases were in Kharkiv region which is now deliberated. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=352.14s)]
*  We have evidences of these cases. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=359.78s)]
*  The most important is to find out proper evidences and to fix them properly. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=364.78s)]
*  What I did at the moment now, I created a special unit of the State Department of the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=372.5s)]
*  Prosecutor's Office General for the sexual violence crimes and we have a specific team [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=381.7s)]
*  of prosecutors who are well trained for this category of crimes. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=389.14s)]
*  It's important for us to communicate with people and to find out these cases in order [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=396.82s)]
*  for the victims of these cases to report about them. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=404.26s)]
*  For this reason we also are in close contact with our colleagues in European countries [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=409.58s)]
*  where a lot of Ukrainians who fled to Europe, some of them could be victims or witnesses [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=415.5s)]
*  of sexual violence crimes. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=427.14s)]
*  We are now communicating, trying to find also these cases. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=429.94s)]
*  In the Office of Prosecutor General we have now more than 40 ongoing investigations on [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=434.66s)]
*  cases where we definitely know that the crime of sexual violence was committed by Russian [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=441.3s)]
*  aggressors. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=448.3s)]
*  Thank you for your time today Mr. Prosecutor General. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZgar00lD8&t=449.82s)]
