*  potentially longer. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=5.46s)]

*  of the G7 to sign a joint declaration of support for Ukraine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=22.26s)]
*  25 additional countries joined us quickly, each agreed to forge a long-term bilateral [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=27.66s)]
*  commitment with Ukraine. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=33.86s)]
*  Presidents Zelensky and I have just now signed that agreement between the United States and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=36.54s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=41.38s)]
*  Our goal is to strengthen Ukraine's credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=43.06s)]
*  long term. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=48.54s)]
*  A lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=49.54s)]
*  now and to deter future aggression anytime in the future. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=55.46s)]
*  The United States is going to help ensure that Ukraine can do both not by sending American [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=60.54s)]
*  troops to fight in Ukraine, but by providing weapons and ammunition, expanding intelligence [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=66.3s)]
*  sharing, continuing to train brave Ukrainian troops at bases in Europe and the United States, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=72.02s)]
*  enhancing interoperability between our militaries in line with NATO standards, investing in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=78.38s)]
*  Ukraine's defense industrial base so in time they can supply their own weapons and munitions, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=85.42s)]
*  working with Ukraine's partners to build a future force that is strong, sustainable, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=91.02s)]
*  and resilient, and supporting Ukraine's economic recovery as well as its energy recovery after [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  Russia's repeatedly targeted Ukraine's energy grid with massive attacks in the futile attempt [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  to break the will of the Ukrainian people. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=109.34s)]
*  All these lines of efforts and others are laid out in this agreement. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=111.94s)]
*  Additionally, the G7 achieved a significant outcome this week on the matter of Russia's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=116.42s)]
*  frozen assets in Europe and other places outside of Russia. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  Back in 2022, two days after Russia's invasion, members of the G7 and the European Union worked [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=128.5s)]
*  together to freeze $280 billion in Russian central bank funds outside of Russia. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=134.34s)]
*  I'm very pleased to share that this week, this week, the G7 signed a plan to finalize [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=141.86s)]
*  and unlock $50 billion from the proceeds of those frozen assets to put that money to work [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=147.94000000000003s)]
*  for Ukraine. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=153.82000000000002s)]
*  Another reminder to Putin, we're not backing down. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=154.82000000000002s)]
*  In fact, we're standing together against this illegal aggression. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=158.78000000000003s)]
*  The agreement that President Zelensky and I just signed also lays out our shared vision [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=162.78000000000003s)]
*  for a just peace, a peace rooted in the UN Charter and the principles of sovereignty [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=167.54s)]
*  and territorial integrity, a peace with a broad base of support around the world that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=172.34s)]
*  holds Russia accountable for the damage that is done in this war. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=177.82s)]
*  We will see this vision strongly affirmed at the historic peace conference happening [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=182.18s)]
*  in Switzerland this weekend, where Vice President Harris will represent the United States. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  Finally, this agreement accelerates Ukraine's integration into the European Atlantic trans-Atlantic [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=191.62s)]
*  communities. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=197.34s)]
*  It includes major commitments from Ukraine to impact and to implement democratic economic [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=198.34s)]
*  and security reforms in line with the European Union's accession goals and NATO's programs [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=206.38s)]
*  of reform. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=212.1s)]
*  While we take this step, the United States is also intensifying pressure on Russia. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=213.86s)]
*  Yesterday, the U.S. Treasury Department made clear any bank anywhere in the world that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=219.1s)]
*  deals with sanctioned Russian banks, companies or individuals risk being sanctioned themselves. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=225.26000000000002s)]
*  And we announced roughly 300 new sanctions on individuals and companies that are helping [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=231.22s)]
*  Russia war off. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  They include key parts of Russia's financial sector. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=238.82000000000002s)]
*  I'll wait till it goes over. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=241.82000000000002s)]
*  As well as individual entities that supply Russia with items critical to its defense [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=250.82s)]
*  production, like micro-electronics, machine tools and industrial materials, we also sanction [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=256.06s)]
*  more Russian future energy projects. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=265.06s)]
*  That Russia's natural gas oil projects that are under construction and are not yet fully [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=267.5s)]
*  operating. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=272.21999999999997s)]
*  Putin is counting on revenues from these projects. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=273.46s)]
*  Our sanctions will disrupt those plans. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=276.18s)]
*  Plus, at the G7, we discussed our shared concern about countries like China, where resources [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=278.58s)]
*  are supplying Russia with materials they need for their war machine. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=284.38s)]
*  And we agreed to taking collective action to push back against that activity. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=288.09999999999997s)]
*  Let me close with this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=293.97999999999996s)]
*  We've taken three major steps at the G7 that collectively show Putin we cannot wait us [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=295.53999999999996s)]
*  out, he cannot divide us, and we'll be with Ukraine until they prevail in this war. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=302.09999999999997s)]
*  First, is the bilateral security agreement just signed? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=308.26s)]
*  Second, historic agreement to provide $50 billion in value from Russian sovereign assets [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=310.98s)]
*  to Ukraine? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=315.82s)]
*  And third, an agreement to ensure our sanctions efforts disrupt third countries that are supplying [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=316.82s)]
*  Russia's war efforts. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=322.62s)]
*  That will increase pressure on the Russian economy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=323.62s)]
*  Collectively, this is a powerful set of actions and will create a stronger foundation for [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=326.5s)]
*  Ukraine's success. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=331.5s)]
*  Two and a half years ago, Putin unleashed a brutal war on Ukraine. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=333.26s)]
*  And it's been a horrifying deal for the Ukrainian people who are so brave and incredible. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=336.26s)]
*  It also been a test for the world. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=340.86s)]
*  Would we stand with Ukraine? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=344.06s)]
*  Would we stand for sovereignty, freedom, and against tyranny? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=346.26s)]
*  The United States, the G7, and countries around the world have consistently answered the question [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=348.86s)]
*  by saying, yes, we will. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=353.66s)]
*  We will say it again. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=355.74s)]
*  Yes, again, and again, and again. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=356.74s)]
*  We're going to stand with Ukraine. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=358.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  And I now yield to my friend from Ukraine, President. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. President Biden, dear President, dear journalists, dear Ukrainians, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  dear Americans. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=374.06s)]
*  And thank you so much. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=376.5s)]
*  Thanks, Italy and Georgia, for invitation. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=377.86s)]
*  Dear friends, today is a truly historic day. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=380.94s)]
*  We have signed the strongest agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. since our independence. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=387.62s)]
*  And this is an agreement on security and thus on the protection of human life. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=398.02000000000004s)]
*  This is an agreement on cooperation and thus on how our nations will become stronger. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=405.54s)]
*  This is an agreement on steps to guarantee sustainable peace and therefore it benefits [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=412.42s)]
*  everyone in the world because the Russian war against Ukraine is a real, real global [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=419.5s)]
*  threat. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=425.9s)]
*  I thank you very much, Mr. President, for your leadership, which is reflected in particular [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=427.54s)]
*  in this agreement and in your years of support for Ukraine. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=435.26s)]
*  I thank our teams, both teams. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=441.53999999999996s)]
*  Thanks very much for making sure that the details of the agreement are really good. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=445.14s)]
*  And of course, I want to thank every Ukrainian soldier, all our people whose courage made [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=451.26s)]
*  this level of alliance between Ukraine and the United States possible. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=459.17999999999995s)]
*  And I am proud of our people and what Ukraine can do. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=465.17999999999995s)]
*  And I am very grateful to all Americans, to everyone in America who strengthens American [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=469.21999999999997s)]
*  leadership. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=476.29999999999995s)]
*  So under the points of the agreement, first, the agreement contains a very detailed legally [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=478.61999999999995s)]
*  binding part. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=485.17999999999995s)]
*  And this means the credibility of America's support for our Ukrainian independence. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=487.65999999999997s)]
*  Secondly, security commitments from the United States are based, among other things, on the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=495.54s)]
*  sustainability of security and defense support, not only for the duration of this war, but [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=500.38s)]
*  also for the period of peace after the war. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=508.22s)]
*  And we will definitely ensure peace. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=513.34s)]
*  Third, it clearly states that America supports Ukraine's efforts to win this war. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=516.14s)]
*  Fourth, the agreement has good provisions on weapons for our defense, very specifically [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=524.22s)]
*  on the better systems, very specifically on the supply of fighter squadrons to Ukraine. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=530.38s)]
*  That's right, plural squadrons, including but not limited to F-16s. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=538.5400000000001s)]
*  We have worked for a long time for these. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=544.9000000000001s)]
*  The agreement is also very specific about the supply of the necessary weapons, joint [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=549.18s)]
*  production and strengthening of the defense industries of our countries through our cooperation. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=553.9399999999999s)]
*  And this is something that will not only provide security, but also new good jobs for Ukrainians [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=562.38s)]
*  and Americans. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=569.78s)]
*  The agreement also outlines what is needed in terms of intelligence, information. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=571.38s)]
*  The agreement contains key aspects of protecting the lives of our people. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=578.58s)]
*  Fifth, it is very important that the agreement also addresses the issue of Russia's just [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=584.98s)]
*  responsibility for this war and its attempts to destroy Ukrainians. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=591.74s)]
*  America supports both fair compensation for the damage caused by Russian strikes and working [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=598.0200000000001s)]
*  out ways to ensure that frozen Russian assets are used to protect and rebuild Ukraine. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=603.74s)]
*  The agreement also includes sanctions and expert controls that will make Russia feel [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=612.7s)]
*  the pain for what it is doing against the freedom of peoples. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=619.62s)]
*  And two more things. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=626.1s)]
*  I am grateful that the philosophy of our security agreement is in fact the philosophy of the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=627.98s)]
*  alliance. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=635.26s)]
*  And that is why the issue of NATO is covered through the text of the agreement. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=637.02s)]
*  It states that America supports Ukraine's future membership in NATO and recognizes that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=643.5s)]
*  our security agreement is a bridge to Ukraine's membership in NATO. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=651.0600000000001s)]
*  It is very important for all Ukrainians and for all Europeans to know that there will [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=657.34s)]
*  be no security deficit in Europe which tempts the aggressor to war and makes the future [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=663.14s)]
*  uncertain. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=670.38s)]
*  Now, we are clearly defining everything. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=671.38s)]
*  We will cooperate for the sake of victory, make peace guarantees effective and provide [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=677.06s)]
*  the necessary security for our people. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=683.12s)]
*  And thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership in the G7's decision on the $50 billion loan [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=686.28s)]
*  for Ukraine, its vital step forward in providing sustainable support for Ukraine in winning [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=694.4s)]
*  this war. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=701.56s)]
*  One immobilized assets should be used for defending lives of Ukrainians from Russian [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=704.2s)]
*  terror and for repaying the damage aggressor caused to Ukraine. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=712.4s)]
*  It's fair and absolutely right. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=717.2s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you, your team. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=720.0s)]
*  I would also like to thank the United States Congress for their support, both parties, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=722.44s)]
*  both chambers. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=727.8000000000001s)]
*  Thank you and thanks to every American heart that does not betray freedom and supports [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=729.76s)]
*  us. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=736.4s)]
*  Slava Ukraina. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=737.4s)]
*  Now what we'll do is we're going to take two questions from American reporters and two [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=738.4s)]
*  questionnaires from two American reporters and questionnaires from two Ukrainian reporters. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=749.88s)]
*  The first person I'm going to call on is Colleen Long, Associated Press. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=757.04s)]
*  Thanks, Mr. President. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=767.04s)]
*  About two weeks ago, you changed course to allow Ukraine to fire U.S. weapons into Russia. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=769.28s)]
*  Given the reported successes, would you consider further expanding the parameters on U.S. weapons [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=775.24s)]
*  into Russia, even despite your concerns about escalation? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=779.88s)]
*  And on the news from home, you're going through something that so many American families go [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=783.84s)]
*  through, the intersection of addiction and the criminal justice system, but you're not [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=787.6800000000001s)]
*  like most families. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=792.4000000000001s)]
*  Was your son able to get a fair trial? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=794.48s)]
*  Do you believe the Justice Department operated independently of politics? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=796.36s)]
*  And for President — [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=801.72s)]
*  Let me answer your question and you ask his question, okay? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=802.72s)]
*  With regard to the first question, it is clear that the near-abroad meeting just across [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=806.32s)]
*  the line of the border with Russia and Ukraine, that it makes a lot of sense for Ukraine to [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=815.2s)]
*  be able to take out or combat what is coming across that border. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=822.24s)]
*  In terms of long-range weapons, longer-range weapons into the interior of Russia, we have [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=827.72s)]
*  not changed our position on that sort. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=833.76s)]
*  With regard to the question regarding the family, I'm extremely proud of my son, Hunter. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=836.1600000000001s)]
*  He has overcome an addiction. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=842.08s)]
*  He is — he's one of the brightest, most decent men I know. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=843.64s)]
*  And I am satisfied that I'm not going to do anything I said — I said I'd abide by [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=848.4s)]
*  the jury decision, and I will do that, and I will not pardon him. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=853.64s)]
*  President Zelensky, a number of leaders here in Italy, including President Biden, are facing [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=859.12s)]
*  upcoming election challenges. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=868.24s)]
*  How will the security agreement signed tonight and the other promises of support continue [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=870.6s)]
*  if they are not in office? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=876.76s)]
*  And what's your contingency plan if they don't? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=878.72s)]
*  Thank you for this question. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=886.56s)]
*  May I ask — first and foremost, I'd like to thank the people of the nations, first [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=892.8s)]
*  and foremost, to the United States, to the countries in Europe and on other continents [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=901.8s)]
*  who have supported us since the very beginning of this absolutely unjust war of Russia against [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=906.28s)]
*  the people of Ukraine. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=912.68s)]
*  And that is it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=913.9200000000001s)]
*  They've been killing people, homes and territory. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=915.44s)]
*  All that is very important. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=919.44s)]
*  It is part of life. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=920.44s)]
*  But first and foremost, we are speaking about people and lives of people. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=921.44s)]
*  You understand? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=925.36s)]
*  And this war was unjust since the very beginning, the war of this evil. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=926.36s)]
*  His name is Putin, the war against the people of Ukraine. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=933.64s)]
*  He has killed so many people. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=939.12s)]
*  To say that it is not him, there was a military man who did it. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=941.72s)]
*  The last one is just an instrument of his, and he is playing this instrument. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  And therefore, it is important for us that since the very beginning we were supported [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=951.72s)]
*  by people, by nations, because they understood that we share common values. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=956.0400000000001s)]
*  We simply want to live. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=962.1600000000001s)]
*  And the people understood. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=963.84s)]
*  They imagined what would happen if such evil attacks them, and therefore we were supported [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=965.08s)]
*  by people. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=971.32s)]
*  And I thank President Biden and all the leaders who, since the very beginning of the invasion, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=972.32s)]
*  Putin's invasion started to support us. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=977.36s)]
*  They based on their values. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=979.64s)]
*  They were based on the voice of their people. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=982.32s)]
*  And it is impossible without people. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=988.24s)]
*  And I am sure that this nation chooses leaders and presidents, and it seems to me that no [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=990.36s)]
*  matter whom the nation chooses, first and foremost, it seems to me that everything depends [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1001.36s)]
*  on the unity within this or that state. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1008.96s)]
*  If the people are with us, any leader will be with us in this struggle for freedom. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1012.96s)]
*  Yes, please, Inter. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1029.84s)]
*  Irina Ivanova, Inter TV Channel Ukraine. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1031.84s)]
*  And I have a question for both leaders. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1033.84s)]
*  So today during the G7 meeting, the discussion focused on developing Ukraine's air defence [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1036.92s)]
*  system based on the most advanced Western complexes and also on enhancing long-range [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1042.0s)]
*  capabilities. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1047.5200000000002s)]
*  So my question is, can you provide any details on the initiative and about the readiness [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1048.68s)]
*  of our allies to take part in it? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1053.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1055.72s)]
*  I'd be happy to respond to that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1056.72s)]
*  We have acquired commitment from five countries so far for Patriot batteries and other air [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1060.2800000000002s)]
*  defence systems, as well as we've let it be known to those countries that are expecting [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1066.88s)]
*  from us air defence systems in the future, that they're going to have to wait. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1072.8000000000002s)]
*  Everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1078.3200000000002s)]
*  And then we will make good on the commitments we made to other countries. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1081.68s)]
*  I think President Biden already answered your question. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1087.0800000000002s)]
*  Actually, he knows and all other partners, they know that urgently we need seven Patriot [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1089.96s)]
*  systems to save our cities. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1099.24s)]
*  Not all of them. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1102.6000000000001s)]
*  It's a pity, but urgently seven. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1103.6000000000001s)]
*  And we discussed the possibility of having five of them. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1106.64s)]
*  It's true, but the partners work on it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1111.24s)]
*  It doesn't mean that tomorrow we will have these five systems. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1114.4s)]
*  We will have them. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1118.04s)]
*  But we see in the closest future, good result for Ukraine. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1119.04s)]
*  You'll have some relatively quickly. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1122.04s)]
*  American reporter Josh Winegrove Bloomberg. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1126.56s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1132.76s)]
*  I have a question for Mr. President Zelensky shortly on the announcements. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1133.76s)]
*  But if you don't mind, I'd like to ask you about your discussions on the situation in [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1137.52s)]
*  Gaza here at the summit. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1141.52s)]
*  You were asked just a short time ago about it after the skydiving demonstration. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1143.76s)]
*  Can you give us your assessment of Hamas's response? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1148.8s)]
*  And do you believe that they are trying to work towards a deal? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1152.84s)]
*  Or is this response working against a deal? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1157.0s)]
*  And what is your message to allies, including those here at the G7, about what more, if [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1160.32s)]
*  anything, the U.S. can do to drive towards a peace agreement? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1165.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1169.44s)]
*  I think you guys will play by the rules a little bit. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1170.92s)]
*  I'm here to talk about a critical situation in Ukraine. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1173.92s)]
*  You asked me another subject. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1177.8s)]
*  I'll be happy to answer in detail later. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1178.8s)]
*  But the bottom line is that we've made an agreement. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1181.0800000000002s)]
*  I've laid out an approach that has been endorsed by the UN Security Council, by the G7, by [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1184.72s)]
*  the Israelis. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1191.44s)]
*  And the biggest hang up so far is Hamas refusing to sign on, even though they have been. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1192.68s)]
*  They have submitted something similar. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1200.4s)]
*  Whether it comes to fruition remains to be seen. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1203.0s)]
*  We're going to continue to push. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1206.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't have a final answer for you. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1207.1200000000001s)]
*  And to President Biden's point, a question about today's discussions. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1212.1200000000001s)]
*  President Zelensky, the $50 billion today, you've had the supplemental, of course, from [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1217.3200000000002s)]
*  the U.S. Congress recently. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1222.0s)]
*  Can you give us an assessment of the situation on the battlefield right now? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1224.24s)]
*  And what has been given now, how long will this get you in terms of either stopping the [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1228.92s)]
*  Russian advance or making headway on this? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1236.2s)]
*  And how long will it last you if indeed future leaders or current leaders are unable to reach [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1239.72s)]
*  consensus on further aid packages? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1245.68s)]
*  And President Biden, I'd welcome your assessment of the situation currently on the battlefield [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1248.08s)]
*  and what difference the supplemental has made as well, sir. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1251.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1253.96s)]
*  Thank you for your question. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1258.76s)]
*  Indeed, we were expecting the fundamental package of the support within the Congress [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1263.76s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1272.92s)]
*  And truly, it was a long pause for our warriors first and foremost. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1275.6s)]
*  But it is important and we are grateful that in the very end we have this supplement and [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1279.96s)]
*  this will for sure strengthen our warriors. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1285.68s)]
*  Yes, this has given the opportunity to the enemy within this pause to try to occupy Kharkiv. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1288.9599999999998s)]
*  But that attempt was stopped by our warriors. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1298.12s)]
*  They were repelled. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1301.76s)]
*  The enemy was repelled. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1304.52s)]
*  And we, despite everything, disrupted all their plans. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1305.9199999999998s)]
*  And it seems to me that that is the most important thing. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1308.84s)]
*  This supplement that will arrive gives us, it enables us to fully equip the reserves, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1313.24s)]
*  those guys, those brigades that are ready so that they provide for the opportunity to [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1320.48s)]
*  rotate our units on the battlefield so that they can have some rest, so that the brigades [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1329.08s)]
*  can regenerate so that other brigades enter the battlefield instead of them with equipment. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1334.56s)]
*  This is what the supplement gives them, so the raise of morale, but also the raise of [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1341.9199999999998s)]
*  strength of our brigades. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1346.8s)]
*  And it seems to me that this is the most important. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1348.0s)]
*  For how long this will be enough? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1350.7199999999998s)]
*  Look, we without package have been holding the lines for eight months and the Russians [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1353.1999999999998s)]
*  had no successes. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1357.6799999999998s)]
*  And therefore the question on for how long it will be enough, no, I think the question [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1359.9199999999998s)]
*  has to be for how long the unity will last. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1368.28s)]
*  The unity in the United States together with the European leaders, how these or those elections [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1371.48s)]
*  will influence this unity. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1376.84s)]
*  It seems to me that we should look on this exactly this way, to preserve unity, to preserve [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1379.3999999999999s)]
*  the integrity of the world, integrity of the democratic world, because if Ukraine does [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1385.96s)]
*  not withstand, the democracy of many countries will not be able to withstand, and I'm sure [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1393.72s)]
*  of that. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1399.96s)]
*  By the way, the idea that we had to wait until we passed the legislation overall, even held [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1400.96s)]
*  up by a small majority of our Republican colleagues, was just terrible. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1406.6000000000001s)]
*  And there's a lot more money coming beyond what's already come in the other tranches [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1412.52s)]
*  that are available now that we passed the legislation. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1417.0s)]
*  So they'll have what they need and get it there as quickly as we possibly can. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1419.92s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. President. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1424.48s)]
*  Telegraph, please. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1427.68s)]
*  Telegraph, please. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1429.2s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1431.6000000000001s)]
*  My name is Yaroslav Zharenov, Telegraph UA. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1432.8000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for this opportunity. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1435.04s)]
*  I have a long way from Kiev and have enough time to prepare such long question. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1436.4s)]
*  Firstly, to Joe Biden. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1442.0s)]
*  Mr. President, the additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act that you signed mandated [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1443.96s)]
*  the submission of strategy war for the war in Ukraine within 45 days after its enactment. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1449.56s)]
*  This deadline passed on June 8th, and now yet the international community has not seen [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1458.8799999999999s)]
*  this strategy. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1464.96s)]
*  Has it been developed? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1465.96s)]
*  And if the strategy is classified, what step does your administration plan to take to a [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1467.56s)]
*  constant Ukraine victory in the war? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1472.6399999999999s)]
*  It's my first question. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1474.6s)]
*  The second will be to the President. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1475.6s)]
*  What was the last part of your question? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1476.6s)]
*  Has it been developed, this strategy, and what steps does your administration plan to [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1479.44s)]
*  take to victory Ukraine in the war? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1486.64s)]
*  The steps we're going to take to make sure that Ukraine has victory in that Russia does [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1491.0800000000002s)]
*  not prevail is continued support what we just signed. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1497.3200000000002s)]
*  We signed it and a significant number of nations have signed it. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1501.88s)]
*  We have convinced the G7, convinced we've got support of the G7 and quite frankly, 48 [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1505.92s)]
*  other countries. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1511.8400000000001s)]
*  We sat with the Prime Minister of Japan, South Korea. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1512.8400000000001s)]
*  We have 50 nations have signed up beyond NATO and the G7. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1517.3600000000001s)]
*  And so we're going to stay as long as it takes. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1522.8000000000002s)]
*  With regard to the plan, that is a plan in process now. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1525.44s)]
*  We're discussing with our Ukrainian friends exactly what it would be. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1529.28s)]
*  We have a lot of movement toward that. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1533.16s)]
*  We know the outlines of it. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1535.76s)]
*  We have not done the detail of it all. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1537.52s)]
*  But we know what Ukraine is capable of doing when given the material to defend themselves. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1539.92s)]
*  And that's exactly what they're doing now. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1545.72s)]
*  And my second question is to President Zelensky. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1552.24s)]
*  It will be in Ukraine. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1555.16s)]
*  And recently you have made a couple of sharp statements regarding China and there are rumors [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1556.16s)]
*  the possible supplies of Russia's weapons to China. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1562.76s)]
*  But from that, China is actively promoting its own peace plan among certain countries. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1565.76s)]
*  What are the motives on Beijing now? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1572.32s)]
*  And would it be possible to change the vision of China regarding our war and which role [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1574.04s)]
*  the US can play in this? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1577.52s)]
*  And the final question, is China a partner of Russia in these crimes that it commits? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1578.52s)]
*  I understand that your trip was long. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1587.32s)]
*  First of all, I had a phone conversation with a leader of China by phone. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1595.6s)]
*  He said that he will not sell any weapon to Russia. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1603.6s)]
*  That is the first. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1608.9199999999998s)]
*  We'll see with you. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1609.9199999999998s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1610.9199999999998s)]
*  He said to me, if he is a respectable person, he will not, because he gave me the word. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1611.92s)]
*  The second, our, you know, very good with details, our peace formula, it's very open [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1619.6000000000001s)]
*  for everybody, basing on charter. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1626.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes, UNHCR. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1628.92s)]
*  And you know that it's it bases on next principles, territorial integrity, sovereignty, nuclear [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1631.16s)]
*  security, food security. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1642.4s)]
*  If China has alternative view on it, it can prepare alternative peace formula. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1646.8400000000001s)]
*  If we share common views on it, like with globally, with all the world, I think so. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1658.36s)]
*  So if they share the same way to peace, we will find dialogue. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1664.7199999999998s)]
*  By the way, China is not supplying weapons, but the ability to produce those weapons and [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1672.6s)]
*  the technology available to do it. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1678.9199999999998s)]
*  So it is, in fact, helping Russia. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1681.12s)]
*  Thank you all so very much. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1684.6s)]
*  This concludes our press conference. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1686.12s)]
*  Thank you, everybody. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1687.9199999999998s)]
*  All right, we all heard it live. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1688.9199999999998s)]
*  President Biden and President Zelensky speaking following the signing of a security agreement [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1695.8s)]
*  between the U.S. and Ukraine. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1700.4799999999998s)]
*  Biden says the U.S. will continue to provide weapons, ammunition and training for Ukrainian [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1702.9599999999998s)]
*  soldiers. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1708.04s)]
*  He says that the U.S. will not be backing down in support of Ukraine in the war against [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1709.04s)]
*  Russia and will keep intensifying pressure on Russia in many ways, including sanctions [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1714.32s)]
*  again and again. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1718.76s)]
*  Yes, he said, we will stand with Ukraine. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1720.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1722.96s)]
*  And we also heard President Zelensky saying that this deal really is historic as far as [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1723.96s)]
*  this agreement with the U.S. on security, which should be binding at least for a decade. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1729.08s)]
*  He said, quote, the protection of human lives is what this is really about and saying the [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1735.04s)]
*  agreement will arm his country with F-16 aircraft, which his country has long sought in defending [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1739.72s)]
*  itself against Russia. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1746.8400000000001s)]
*  Zelensky says the 50 billion dollar loan for Ukraine from the G7 is a vital step forward. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1748.68s)]
*  And then you heard also during that Q&A them providing some other remarks on this and other [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1757.6000000000001s)]
*  topics. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1762.16s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Willie James Inman was listening to this as well from the [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1763.16s)]
*  White House and joins us now with really your take, Willie, on what we just heard and [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1767.0s)]
*  did not hear from President Biden on this. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1772.92s)]
*  Hey there. Good to be with you, Errol and Lana on this Thursday afternoon. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1775.96s)]
*  I thought it was interesting first on the domestic issue and the family issue that President [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1779.8s)]
*  Biden has. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1784.48s)]
*  He essentially said that he respects the jury's decision and this conviction of his son, Hunter [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1785.84s)]
*  Biden. But he said again, as he said in an interview with ABC News last week, I think [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1792.12s)]
*  that he wouldn't pardon his son. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1796.96s)]
*  But he wasn't asked a follow up. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1798.68s)]
*  I think the important follow up is would he commute his son's sentence? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1800.4s)]
*  That's an interesting question for not only the president, but this White House. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1804.2s)]
*  They have refused to say as much on back to the issue at hand here with Ukraine. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1807.72s)]
*  I thought it was interesting where when President Zelensky said essentially that the credibility [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1813.2s)]
*  of the United States is on the line in terms of this deal. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1818.32s)]
*  I'll remind our viewers that it's not necessarily a treaty. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1822.56s)]
*  It's not binding in the greater sense of things in terms of making sure that United States [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1825.1599999999999s)]
*  defends Ukraine. That's something that's not happening. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1830.6399999999999s)]
*  The president said that troops wouldn't be going to Ukraine, but instead it is intended [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1832.84s)]
*  to provide assistance to Ukraine, provide military aid training and intelligence sharing [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1837.84s)]
*  for the next 10 years. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1842.8799999999999s)]
*  But a future American president could undo this. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1844.76s)]
*  Former President Trump, if he were to be elected, could undo this because this is essentially [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1847.7199999999998s)]
*  at the executive level. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1851.52s)]
*  So it's important to point that out. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1852.6s)]
*  The White House isn't saying as much in this press conference, but I think those are some [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1854.64s)]
*  of the key takeaways from this press conference on top of the situation in Gaza, which the [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1858.5600000000002s)]
*  president seemed a little bit irritated about that question there, although it is certainly [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1863.16s)]
*  an open question as to why this deal isn't going through the president putting the blame [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1867.72s)]
*  on Hamas there. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1872.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1873.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, I thought it was interesting when Zelensky was asked about the possibility that [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1874.0800000000002s)]
*  all this becomes unraveled by another administration. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1880.48s)]
*  He meant again, he came to to appeal to the American people and he said, no matter who [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1884.12s)]
*  the the American people elects, quote, if the people are with us, the leader will be with [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1889.96s)]
*  us in the struggle for freedom. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1895.6s)]
*  So hearing him sort of address that question about whether this would last the full 10 [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1897.4399999999998s)]
*  years. I wanted to also ask you about something that jumped out at me when President Biden [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1904.3999999999999s)]
*  was essentially saying Ukraine is the top priority when it comes to supplying particularly [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1910.2s)]
*  missile defense systems. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1915.64s)]
*  And he said everyone else will have to wait. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1916.92s)]
*  Was that in some ways him signaling anything about his growing rift with Israeli [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1920.3600000000001s)]
*  leadership? The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that there's also an act of war there. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1927.28s)]
*  The Biden administration has been criticized in terms of continuing to supply ammunition [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1931.96s)]
*  and support in in that war. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1938.88s)]
*  Or was that something to more or less be expected? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1941.88s)]
*  I think it was a way for the president to signal how important this situation is in [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1946.16s)]
*  terms of the fight against autocracy and democracy. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1951.2800000000002s)]
*  This is something that the president talks about time and time again. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1954.6000000000001s)]
*  And one of the key things that Ukraine wants is those missile defense systems. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1957.96s)]
*  They want several of them if they can have them. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1963.2800000000002s)]
*  And the president kind of alluding to how quickly they can get them there to Ukraine for [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1965.3200000000002s)]
*  them to be able to defend themselves. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1970.96s)]
*  I'll note one of the most recent rounds of aid to Israel wasn't necessarily something [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1972.48s)]
*  that the Israelis needed necessarily right away. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1977.8400000000001s)]
*  I'll point out that some of these systems, some of the things that the Israelis use, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1981.2s)]
*  rather, they already have stockpiles of. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1985.0400000000002s)]
*  So in terms of the president addressing the situation, in terms of the immediate need, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1987.4s)]
*  there is an immediate need in Ukraine. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1991.16s)]
*  Of course, there's a need there in Israel as well with its ongoing fight against Hamas. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1992.64s)]
*  But there is that rift there, Lata. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1998.0800000000002s)]
*  I think that's one of the elephants in the room when you talk about this situation and [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=1999.44s)]
*  this relationship between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is coming [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2003.5200000000002s)]
*  here in the next couple of weeks, he's going to be addressing Congress. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2007.2800000000002s)]
*  I think it'll be interesting to see whether or not he gets an invite to the White House, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2011.8400000000001s)]
*  whether or not he sits down with President Biden to talk about this situation. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2016.0800000000002s)]
*  But still, nonetheless, two very important things going on on the world stage here, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2020.0800000000002s)]
*  President Biden choosing today to focus on Ukraine, although the situation in Gaza continues [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2024.48s)]
*  to get worse day by day. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2029.3600000000001s)]
*  But that's why it's always interesting to watch these live events, because while Biden [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2030.88s)]
*  stuck to the script during his remarks, it was the way he phrased answers in an unscripted [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2034.3200000000002s)]
*  way that may have revealed, you know, his true perspective on some items. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2039.2s)]
*  And Zelensky speaking, choosing to speak English for his remarks, but answering questions in [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2043.28s)]
*  Ukrainian. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2048.48s)]
*  That line about a security vacuum that would tempt aggressor to war. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2049.52s)]
*  You get the sense that it was for an American audience, an English speaking audience. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2054.4s)]
*  Before we let you go, Willie, we know that this is part of a bigger week for the president. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2059.44s)]
*  The G7 will continue. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2063.44s)]
*  What else will be on his agenda? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2065.6s)]
*  He's been quite busy around the world the past couple of weeks. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2067.76s)]
*  He certainly has with a trip in France last week, now in Italy this week for the G7 meetings. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2070.48s)]
*  The president will fly back here. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2075.44s)]
*  He'll attend some fundraisers in California. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2077.68s)]
*  That's where he's expected to attend a very star studded fundraiser to raise some money [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2080.48s)]
*  for his campaign. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2085.2s)]
*  He did talk about this briefly, the vice president going to that peace conference, the peace [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2086.56s)]
*  security conference for Ukraine and representing the United States in this upcoming weekend. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2091.3599999999997s)]
*  President Biden having a busy schedule. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2098.24s)]
*  Remember, he is not only, of course, commander in chief there representing the United States [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2100.0s)]
*  at the G7, but he has to campaign much like other world leaders are in a tough political [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2104.72s)]
*  spot as well. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2109.6s)]
*  The president making sure he focuses on his campaign, raising some money. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2111.3599999999997s)]
*  Of course, he has the debate with former President Trump in Atlanta in the coming weeks as well. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2114.9599999999996s)]
*  Lana, Eero? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2120.16s)]
*  I've got to drill down a lot of things. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2120.7999999999997s)]
*  Thankfully, that drilling around you ended. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2122.72s)]
*  Willie James Inman, thanks for carrying through it all for us. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2124.64s)]
*  You bet. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2127.2799999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2127.7599999999998s)]
*  At this point, we're going to take a very short break. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2129.6s)]
*  Up next with the Supreme Court's unanimous decision to protect the availability of a [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2131.84s)]
*  popular abortion pill means for reproductive rights. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2136.32s)]
*  We're streaming CBS News 24 7. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icQI3iFsCLE&t=2139.04s)]
