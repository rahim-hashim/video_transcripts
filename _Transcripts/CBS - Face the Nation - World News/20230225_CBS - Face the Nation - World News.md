# CIA Director Burns: Iran hasn't yet decided to resume nuclear weaponization
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAz2aleCDG0)
*  Have Iran's leaders made the decision to pursue a nuclear weapon? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAz2aleCDG0&t=0.0s)]
*  To the best of our knowledge, we don't believe that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAz2aleCDG0&t=5.14s)]
*  the supreme leader in Iran has yet made a decision to resume the weaponization of program that we judge that they [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAz2aleCDG0&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  suspended or stopped at the end of 2003. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAz2aleCDG0&t=16.82s)]
*  But the other two legs of the stool, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAz2aleCDG0&t=20.34s)]
*  meaning enrichment programs, they've obviously advanced very far. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAz2aleCDG0&t=23.46s)]
*  84% purity, reportedly. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAz2aleCDG0&t=27.68s)]
*  They've advanced very far to the point where it would only be a matter of weeks before they could enrich to 90% [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAz2aleCDG0&t=30.0s)]
*  if they chose to cross that line. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAz2aleCDG0&t=35.72s)]
*  And also in terms of their missile systems, their ability to deliver a nuclear weapon once they developed it has also been [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAz2aleCDG0&t=38.36s)]
*  advancing as well. So the answer to your question is no, we don't see evidence that they made a decision to resume that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAz2aleCDG0&t=45.72s)]
*  weaponization program, but the other dimensions of this challenge, I think, are growing at a worrisome pace too. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAz2aleCDG0&t=51.6s)]
