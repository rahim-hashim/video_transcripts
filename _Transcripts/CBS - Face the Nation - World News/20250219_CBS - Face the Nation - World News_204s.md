# How much money does the U.S. give Ukraine and where does it go?
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls)
*  As we've been reporting, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is accusing President Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=0.0s)]
*  of spreading disinformation after President Trump made this remark during a press conference [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=4.64s)]
*  at Mar-a-Lago Tuesday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=9.0s)]
*  I believe President Zelensky said last week that he doesn't know where half of the money [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=11.28s)]
*  is that we gave him. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=15.84s)]
*  Well, we gave them, I believe, $350 billion. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=17.04s)]
*  But let's say it's something less than that, but it's a lot. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=20.48s)]
*  So to help clarify, let's bring in Mark Kancey. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=24.86s)]
*  He is a senior advisor with the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=26.52s)]
*  and International Studies. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=30.28s)]
*  Thank you for being here, Mark. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=32.08s)]
*  First off, how much money has the U.S. approved in funds related to the war in Ukraine? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=33.08s)]
*  No official number, but most calculations come up with about $175 billion. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=37.72s)]
*  There are some institutions that add a few things in. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Sometimes they take a few things out. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=47.0s)]
*  But $175 billion is a consensus figure. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=49.36s)]
*  It looks like the $350 billion that Trump cited is twice that, and someone may have [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=53.12s)]
*  told him that the total number is twice what we've appropriated. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=58.54s)]
*  Can you break down exactly what those funds are spent on? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=63.04s)]
*  The funds are spent on a variety of things. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=67.56s)]
*  They are spent on sending equipment to Ukraine, spent on U.S. forces in Eastern Europe. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=70.08s)]
*  there at the beginning of the war to enhance deterrence. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=80.1s)]
*  Some of those forces are still there. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=84.69999999999999s)]
*  Some of it goes to Ukraine so they can buy U.S. weapons. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  Some of it goes to training of Ukrainian troops. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  But there's also a chunk that goes to humanitarian operations, mostly in Europe, some in Ukraine, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=93.94s)]
*  some in the United States. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=99.5s)]
*  And finally, there's a fair amount that goes to economic support to Ukraine, helping to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=101.3s)]
*  replace tax revenues that were lost. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=108.26s)]
*  That goes through the World Bank. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=111.26s)]
*  So this comment from President Trump saying he believes President Zelensky said last week [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=112.98s)]
*  he doesn't know where half the money we gave them is. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=117.18s)]
*  What do you make of that comment? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  And can you fact check that for us? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  That's a misunderstanding of something that Zelensky said. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=123.5s)]
*  He said the United States has given us $175 billion, but we only received $77 billion, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=126.58000000000001s)]
*  I think he said. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=134.18s)]
*  I don't know where the rest is. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=135.68s)]
*  He didn't say that we got $175 billion. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=137.08s)]
*  And what that reflects is the fact that only about $75 billion actually goes through the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=142.88s)]
*  Ukrainian government. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=147.78s)]
*  The rest goes through other mechanisms as a result of the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=149.12s)]
*  And in fact, the whole notion of aid to Ukraine is a misnomer because so much of it goes to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=153.84s)]
*  other purposes like humanitarian assistance, like support of U.S. armed forces. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=159.12s)]
*  So what Zelensky said was confusing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=166.28s)]
*  And then the takes on it that half the money is missing are erroneous. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=170.68s)]
*  So erroneous. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=176.4s)]
*  In a world where we like to see things sometimes as black and white and we like to see, okay, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=177.68s)]
*  this comment is wrong, this comment is right, is there nuance here or is it simply provable [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=181.36s)]
*  that funds that the United States has sent to Ukraine are not in fact missing or unaccounted for? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=187.06s)]
*  All the funds are accounted for and there is a very aggressive effort to make sure that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=193.46s)]
*  they all go to where they're supposed to go. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=198.46s)]
*  Mark Kansian, thank you for joining. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUpf3pxBls&t=202.26s)]
