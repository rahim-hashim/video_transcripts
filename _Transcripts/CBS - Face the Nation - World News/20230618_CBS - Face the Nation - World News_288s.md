# Blinken, Chinese foreign minister meet in China as U.S. hopes to avoid a military clash
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q)
*  We want to begin with Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to China, the first U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  diplomatic mission there in five years. Margaret is in Beijing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=4.8s)]
*  Margaret, it looks like good evening to you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  It is, Bob, and good morning to you. Here in Beijing, more than five and a half hours [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  worth of talks between Secretary Blinken and his Chinese counterpart concluded they were [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=17.28s)]
*  very direct, they were very candid, but frankly, it's good that they were talking at all. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=22.8s)]
*  Bob, one of the U.S. officials in the room told me there was at least one point of agreement, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=28.68s)]
*  and that was to stop the downward spiral in this relationship, but it is clear they still have [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=33.32s)]
*  profound differences. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=39.72s)]
*  Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Ching Gong, a close ally of President Xi Jinping, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=43.72s)]
*  tackled a long list of grievances. The U.S. call? Open communication channels to avoid a military [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=49.16s)]
*  clash. Tensions spiked last summer when then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=56.68s)]
*  and again in February after the spy balloon shoot down. Now President Biden wants to move on. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=63.8s)]
*  Beijing objects to the U.S. military presence in the Pacific. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=82.2s)]
*  China's defense chief refuses to speak with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=86.68s)]
*  at a time when Beijing is massively expanding its nuclear arsenal. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=91.56s)]
*  The door is open, and my phone line is open. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=95.72000000000001s)]
*  Miscommunication risks a clash. Last month, a Chinese warship came within 150 feet of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  slamming into an American ship transiting the Taiwan Strait. And in the South China Sea, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=108.2s)]
*  a Chinese fighter jet buzzed the U.S. Air Force. The divide runs deeper than a failure to communicate. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=114.44s)]
*  Blinken also pressed authorities to crack down on the flow of fentanyl. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=121.8s)]
*  That drug is now the number one killer of Americans under the age of 50. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=126.36s)]
*  Beijing has its own motivations to meet. It wants investments to continue to flow as its economy is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=131.24s)]
*  slowing. The recent Biden administration decision to cut off the sale of some advanced technology [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=137.4s)]
*  and high-end computer chips is causing concern. Secretary Blinken will have a working dinner [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=142.92s)]
*  with his Chinese counterpart tonight, and tomorrow he plans to meet with a top party [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=149.88s)]
*  official who oversees foreign policy. All of these meetings really an intense push [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=155.48s)]
*  to try to hit restart on this relationship. Bob? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=162.27999999999997s)]
*  Margaret, speaking of a restart, what do both sides hope to achieve from these meetings, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=166.27999999999997s)]
*  and will there be deliverables? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=171.16s)]
*  Expectations have been set very low for actual achievements in terms of deliverables, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=173.96s)]
*  as they call them in Washington. But we know that here in Beijing, the ultimate hope may be for a [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=179.96s)]
*  face-to-face meeting between President Xi and President Biden this fall, perhaps as soon as [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=186.2s)]
*  September, or at a key conference in California this coming November. So all of this may be [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  building up to that meeting between the two leaders of the world's most powerful economies. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=199.08s)]
*  In the meantime, it is that economic interest that is also of chief concern here at the U.S. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=206.52s)]
*  and Chinese economies are so intertwined. There's interest in lowering tension to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  alleviate some of that nervousness in the business community. And we also know that when it comes to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=217.72000000000003s)]
*  concern about technology and investment, the U.S. wants to continue that flow between both countries [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=226.12s)]
*  and wants to tamp down some of the concern going into this next year. But fundamentally here, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=235.56s)]
*  President Biden believes that this country of China is the only one in the world that has both [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  the power and the intent to change the global order. This is about competition. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=249.0s)]
*  Margaret, will Secretary Blinken meet with Xi Jinping? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=255.88s)]
*  Bob, that meeting may depend on these next 24 hours and how they go. But arrangements are being [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=259.47999999999996s)]
*  made for President Xi to meet with Antony Blinken, the secretary of state who has been a key aid [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=266.76s)]
*  to President Biden over his many years in the Senate and in the White House. So this is an [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=274.28s)]
*  important face-to-face to lay the groundwork for that possible presidential summit. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vlGUoxi-Q&t=281.0s)]
