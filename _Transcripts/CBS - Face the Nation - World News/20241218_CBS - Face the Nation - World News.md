# Could Trump's tariffs push Canada's Trudeau out of office?
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=0.0s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada haven't even gone into effect. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=2.0s)]
*  They may never, but he's threatening them. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=5.84s)]
*  And it's already plunged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government into turmoil. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=7.68s)]
*  On Monday, Trudeau's one-time ally, the finance minister and Deputy Prime Minister Christa [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=11.74s)]
*  Freeland, who used to be a reporter here in Washington, resigned in the most un-Canadian [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=15.72s)]
*  way by sharing a sharply critical assessment of her old boss in a publicly posted resignation [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=20.48s)]
*  letter. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=25.88s)]
*  It all comes after Trudeau flew down to Mar-a-Lago to talk trade, and Trump trolled the Prime [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=26.88s)]
*  Minister by calling Canada the 51st state. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=34.12s)]
*  We're subsidizing Canada, we're subsidizing Mexico, and that can't go on. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=38.56s)]
*  Then I get along with the people of Mexico and Canada very well, but we can't let that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=42.32s)]
*  happen. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=46.44s)]
*  Mercedes Stevenson is the Ottawa bureau chief for Canada's Global News and the host of the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=48.44s)]
*  West Bloc political show. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=52.32s)]
*  Mercedes, thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  Now, the prime minister, as I understand it, canceled an interview he had scheduled with [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=56.04s)]
*  you this afternoon in addition to canceling a lot of other media appearances here for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=59.36s)]
*  the end of the year. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=64.12s)]
*  What does that potentially signal about his standing right now? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=65.4s)]
*  That's right, Ed. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=69.16s)]
*  We got a call at about 5.32 p.m. Eastern last night telling us that the interview that was [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=71.64s)]
*  scheduled for today at 1 p.m. was no longer happening. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=77.4s)]
*  And I said, well, is this just us or everyone? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=81.2s)]
*  And I was told he's canceling all of his year end interviews. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=83.76s)]
*  This is a prime minister who does these interviews every year at Christmas to the point where [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=86.48s)]
*  networks plan Christmas Day specials around it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=91.0s)]
*  So this is really quite remarkable. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=93.96s)]
*  And it tells us not necessarily whether he's staying or going, but that he's in enough [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=95.8s)]
*  trouble that they want to stop anything that is ammunition where he could say the wrong [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  thing or do the wrong thing and will add fuel to the fire. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  And so they have taken the highly unusual step of canceling all of his year end interviews [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=108.44s)]
*  to try to stop that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=112.96s)]
*  Yeah, never a good sign when the public official starts doing that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=113.96s)]
*  Now, how significant was Finance Minister Freeland's resignation and that resignation [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=116.72s)]
*  letter for that matter? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=122.0s)]
*  I mean, absolutely huge. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=125.0s)]
*  I've been on Parliament Hill for 14 years. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  I've never seen a resignation that had an effect like this, Ed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=128.48s)]
*  It was done in the most deliberate and damaging way possible to the prime minister, saying [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=132.76s)]
*  this was about spending and responsibility, about essentially expensive political gimmicks, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=139.24s)]
*  and that she was going to stay on, which signals potentially her intent to run for the leadership [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=149.52s)]
*  This was not only Canada's finance minister, but she was the deputy prime minister. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=150.52s)]
*  So the prime minister's number two. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  To have this kind of a public falling out is extraordinary. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=156.56s)]
*  But I mean, what do you expect? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  We found out that on a call on Friday, a video call that happened between the prime minister [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  and the finance minister, he flat out told her not only was she being shuffled out of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=165.96s)]
*  the finance portfolio, but that she was being replaced by Mark Carney, the former governor [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=169.72s)]
*  of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  That never materialized. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=176.56s)]
*  Carney is now out. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=177.96s)]
*  He is not taking that job. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  But that is what precipitated Freeland's decision to resign. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  Can I ask you sort of a chicken and egg question? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=185.12s)]
*  Is it President-elect Trump and his potential tariff threats that's causing this? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=188.5s)]
*  Or is that merely stoking a fire that was already lit, in essence? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=195.6s)]
*  It's sort of ancillary to it because this was actually an opportunity for Justin Trudeau [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=201.16s)]
*  to get a bump in the polls because a lot of Canadians perceive Donald Trump as being difficult [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=206.28s)]
*  to predict. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=210.8s)]
*  And therefore, when things go wrong, it gets sort of assigned to the, oh, well, it's Donald [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=211.8s)]
*  Trump category rather than why isn't our prime minister handling it correctly. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=216.12s)]
*  So a lot of liberals were anticipating that Trudeau could benefit from this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=220.44s)]
*  And that has not been the case. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=224.60000000000002s)]
*  Instead, Donald Trump has belittled Justin Trudeau at a time when he is highly unpopular [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=226.08s)]
*  with Canadians. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  And this has been the case for about a year for Justin Trudeau. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  I think sometimes people outside Canada don't realize his popularity here has been slipping [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=234.4s)]
*  and stuck in very low numbers. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  He's made a lot of unpopular policy decisions. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=240.84s)]
*  And that's why there's sort of, this is the question on, is this the nail in his coffin? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=243.44s)]
*  But it won't be the Donald Trump factor. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=248.24s)]
*  It will be, in fact, the domestic political factor. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  In our remaining minute, you're in a parliamentary system up there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  So eventually you do have to hold an election. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=256.28s)]
*  What is the latest point at which he can call one? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=258.88s)]
*  And do we anticipate he being the liberal leader and therefore potential prime minister [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=261.96s)]
*  if it's held? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=266.96s)]
*  Great question. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  So December 2025 would legally be the latest he could wait to go into an election, although [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  it's actually legislated to be in the fall of 2025. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=276.08s)]
*  But we're currently in a minority government situation. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=279.92s)]
*  And what that means in Canada is that the government could fall at any time. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=282.76s)]
*  That could be either through Justin Trudeau making a decision to say, I'm calling an election [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=286.36s)]
*  and going to see our governor general. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=290.24s)]
*  It could be him losing the support of both opposition parties, the Bloc Québécois, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  the separatist party and the NDP, who are holding him up right now, or even just a number [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=296.84s)]
*  of members of parliament in those parties, no longer voting with him on confidence votes. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  That could happen as early as February of next year. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=306.36s)]
*  Or it could go all the way through. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  So there's a lot of permutations and combinations. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=311.32s)]
*  The big question is, does he stay on? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=313.88s)]
*  It is widely seen as he will be defeated no matter what in the next election and that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=315.84s)]
*  any liberal leader would be. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=319.76s)]
*  But at this point, there's a lot of calculation by members of parliament and cabinet ministers [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=321.84s)]
*  about whether him staying on damages their chance of keeping their own seat. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=325.88s)]
*  And that's where you're seeing some of that pushback. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=330.2s)]
*  Oh, it's downright delicious. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=331.67999999999995s)]
*  We'll keep an eye on it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  Mercedes Stevenson, thank you so much for breaking it down for us there from Ottawa. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYFJmOTUrk&t=339.44s)]
