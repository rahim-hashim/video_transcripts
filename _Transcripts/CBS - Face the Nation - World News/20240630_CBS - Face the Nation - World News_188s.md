*  party was trounced by the far right in the recent European elections. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=14.52s)]
*  It signals once again the uncertainty about the political changes ahead. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=19.28s)]
*  When Macron called his shock decision a test of truth, the rising floodwaters of the far [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=26.2s)]
*  right, as Macron put it, cannot be ignored. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=31.88s)]
*  With a call to stop the migration, this man, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, may become France's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=35.8s)]
*  next prime minister. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=42.56s)]
*  With a platform promising to crack down on crime and restrict citizenship and rights [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=44.56s)]
*  for foreign residents, his national rally party is poised to potentially win a parliamentary [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=50.04s)]
*  majority. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=56.18s)]
*  The party, led by Marine Le Pen and founded by her Holocaust-denying father, has renounced [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  its anti-Semitic past, but for years has rallied on anti-Muslim rhetoric and described migrants [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=68.08s)]
*  as threatening, particularly to women. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=75.26s)]
*  Macron, who will remain as president for another three years, warned that the far right risked [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=78.22s)]
*  sparking a civil war. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=83.74s)]
*  And in Germany? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=86.97999999999999s)]
*  Police broke up protests this weekend outside the AfD, or Alternative for Germany convention. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=90.1s)]
*  That far right party pulled off its best performance ever in European parliamentary elections, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=96.66s)]
*  worrying Chancellor Olaf Scholz. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=103.06s)]
*  And moving one of AfD's leaders, Björn Håk, from the fringe to the fore. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=105.86s)]
*  Håk said he deplores the Nazis, but he's led chants of their slogans at his rallies, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=111.66s)]
*  which landed him back in court this past week since German law bans the use of Nazi phrases. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  The AfD party advocates for tough deportation policies, is suspicious of climate change [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=125.1s)]
*  and the government response to COVID. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  Waves of migrants, mainly from Syria, Afghanistan and Africa, have been fleeing to Germany since [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=133.82s)]
*  Europe's 2015 refugee crisis. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=140.38s)]
*  Despite these emerging trend lines in Europe, it appears the center did hold in those parliamentary [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=143.62s)]
*  elections at least for now. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=149.22s)]
*  Center right Ursula von der Leyen is expected to remain European Commission president. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=151.7s)]
*  But this Monday, Hungary takes over the rotating presidency of the European Council. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=157.18s)]
*  And Prime Minister Viktor Orban has promised to quote, make Europe great again. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=162.98s)]
*  The slogan a nod to his friend, Donald Trump. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=168.64s)]
*  With the far right still ascending in parts of Europe, it has left some to wonder if America [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=172.11999999999998s)]
*  is any less immune. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  And leaves open the question of what happens next when democracies elect leaders who flirt [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=180.2s)]
*  with anti-democratic tendencies. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhue7KFhjI0&t=185.57999999999998s)]
