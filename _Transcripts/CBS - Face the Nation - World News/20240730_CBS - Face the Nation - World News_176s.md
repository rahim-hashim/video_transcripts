**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM)
*  We have an update now to a story we brought you yesterday, just an absolutely tragic act [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=0.0s)]
*  of violence overseas and we're learning a third child has now died in the mass stabbing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=5.36s)]
*  at a children's dance party in Northwest England. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=9.64s)]
*  Police say the latest victim was a nine-year-old girl. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=12.9s)]
*  The two other girls who died were six and seven. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=15.58s)]
*  Five children and two adults remain in critical condition and a 17-year-old suspect has been [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=18.78s)]
*  arrested. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=23.04s)]
*  Although the motive is not known, police believe the attack is not terror related. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=24.04s)]
*  Nikki Shiller from our partners at the BBC is in Southport, England, where a vigil will [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=28.779999999999998s)]
*  be taking place shortly. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=32.66s)]
*  Are we learning anything more about the suspect in this heinous act? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=34.22s)]
*  So Lindsay, yes, as you say, a vigil is going to be taken here in the centre of Stockport [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=41.9s)]
*  in the next hour or so. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=47.12s)]
*  When it comes to the suspect, we know that he is a 17-year-old boy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=49.94s)]
*  He's been arrested on charges on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=54.66s)]
*  He lives in a village about three miles from here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=62.18s)]
*  The police aren't saying much more. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=66.22s)]
*  We know that his parents originally came from Rwanda and that for a time he lived in Cardiff [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=68.1s)]
*  in Wales but has lived here in the northwest of England since about 2013. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=74.97999999999999s)]
*  The police are saying that it is not terrorist related. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=81.08000000000001s)]
*  They've also urged people not to speculate on social media. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  There have been names circulating on social media that the police say are the wrong names [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=89.56s)]
*  and they have been urging people here not to speculate about it while they continue [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  their investigation. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=100.76s)]
*  Throughout the day, I've been at the coordinate, the scene, and you've seen the forensic teams [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  there combing the area for any clues. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  They will also, of course, be looking at the CCTV and also any doorbell camera footage [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=110.84s)]
*  to try and work out a picture of where the suspect had been until this heinous crime [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=117.56s)]
*  was carried out yesterday at that Taylor Swift themed dance event. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=124.64s)]
*  Taylor herself posted earlier saying that she was in complete shock. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=131.4s)]
*  They were just little kids at a dance class and I think that is what has brought it home [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  to everyone here in the United Kingdom. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  It was a summer event, a summer event that children aged between 6 and 11 were attending [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  and those happen around the world where during the summer you drop your kids off to enjoy [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=151.56s)]
*  some dance or something else and what this has turned into is an absolute horrific tragedy [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=156.8s)]
*  leaving three girls at the moment, nine, six and seven dead and five still critically ill in hospital. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=163.28s)]
*  Yeah, just an unthinkable act. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=172.68s)]
*  Nikki Schiller, thank you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nwzxLPAVM&t=174.8s)]
