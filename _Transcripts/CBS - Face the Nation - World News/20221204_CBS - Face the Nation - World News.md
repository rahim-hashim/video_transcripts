# Blinken says U.S. remains "actively engaged" with Russia over potential prisoner swap
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg)
*  We want to jump right in with our first guest, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who joins [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=0.0s)]
*  us from the State Department. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=4.4s)]
*  Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=6.76s)]
*  Margaret, good morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=8.76s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=10.16s)]
*  I want to start with some breaking news overnight out of Iran. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=11.28s)]
*  They have abolished the morality police. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=15.52s)]
*  This is after months of protests following the death of Massa Amini, who died because [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=17.92s)]
*  she was taken into custody since her head wasn't adequately covered. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Has this stopped the protests that have been raging? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=28.28s)]
*  That's up to the Iranian people. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=31.6s)]
*  This is about them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=33.0s)]
*  It's not about us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=34.36s)]
*  And what we've seen since the killing of Massa Amini has been the extraordinary courage of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=35.92s)]
*  Iranian young people, especially women, who have been leading these protests, standing [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=40.92s)]
*  up for the right to be able to say what they want to say, wear what they want to wear. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=44.44s)]
*  And so if the regime has now responded in some fashion to those protests, that could [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  be a positive thing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=54.02s)]
*  We have to see how it actually plays out in practice and what the Iranian people think. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  This is about them and it's up to them. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=59.4s)]
*  We've also seen protests in China because of these COVID lockdown policies. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=61.64s)]
*  They seem to have died out in recent days. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=66.8s)]
*  Is that because the police state stopped them or have they actually had an effect? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  Well we've seen apparently some easing of the COVID restrictions in recent days, but [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=76.24s)]
*  very hard for us to speak to that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  There again, we've been standing up for the basic principle that people should have the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=83.88s)]
*  right to make their views known peacefully, to protest as the case may be, to vent their [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=87.58s)]
*  frustrations. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  Your deputy, Wendy Sherman, gave a speech here in Washington on Friday where she said, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  I think war is potentially possible because Xi Jinping now has absolute control in China. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=99.64s)]
*  You're about to go to China. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=107.8s)]
*  Do you agree with that assessment? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=109.24s)]
*  So Margaret, we're in an intense competition with China and of course there's nothing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=111.24s)]
*  wrong with competition itself as long as it's basically fair and on a level playing field. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  And we're working with countries around the world to build convergence on the approach [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=120.36s)]
*  to China, which I've seen get very strong in Europe, in Asia. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=124.28s)]
*  And the president has a strong determination to ensure that the competition does not veer [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  into conflict. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=132.04s)]
*  That's one of the reasons that he spent three hours with Xi Jinping in Indonesia on the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=133.28s)]
*  margins of the G20. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  It's one of the reasons that he asked me to go to China early next year, making sure that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=137.68s)]
*  we're talking, we're communicating, we're making clear what we're about, what our intents [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=140.96s)]
*  are, what we're doing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=144.4s)]
*  That's vitally important. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=147.22s)]
*  But war is potentially possible, is what she said. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=148.28s)]
*  The determination that we have is to make sure that the competition does not veer into conflict. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=152.0s)]
*  And this is also what the world expects of us. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=156.12s)]
*  They expect us to responsibly manage the relationship with China. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=158.28s)]
*  This is something that I hear from countries around the world. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=161.8s)]
*  It's exactly what President Biden is doing, standing up strongly for our interests and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=163.88s)]
*  values, working with other countries who are similarly situated to advance them, making [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=167.28s)]
*  sure that we're keeping the contacts open, keeping the dialogue open. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  I want to ask you about Russia. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  President Biden says he has no plans to speak with Vladimir Putin, but he would if there [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=177.2s)]
*  was an indication he wanted to end the war. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  The president's top military adviser, Mark Milley, has said that during this cold period, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=185.56s)]
*  combat will slow and there could be a window for diplomacy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=191.12s)]
*  You're the top diplomat. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=195.12s)]
*  Do you think there's value in trying to start talks? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=196.46s)]
*  There's always value in diplomacy if the parties in question, and in this case Russia, are [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=201.38s)]
*  actually interested in meaningful diplomacy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=207.22s)]
*  And what we've seen, at least recently, is exactly the contrary. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=209.38s)]
*  Even as President Zelensky from Ukraine came to the G20 countries, the leading economies [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  in the world, and put out a proposal for how to move forward toward peace, what did Vladimir [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=218.74s)]
*  Putin did? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=223.22s)]
*  Putin tripled down on everything he was doing, mobilizing more forces, annexing territory [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=224.22s)]
*  in Ukraine, and now trying to weaponize winter. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=229.56s)]
*  He's been unable to win on the battlefield, so he's basically turning his ire and his [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=234.04s)]
*  fire on Ukrainian civilians, going after the energy infrastructure, trying to turn off [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=238.12s)]
*  the lights, turn off the heat, turn off the electricity. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=242.02s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=247.06s)]
*  So unless and until Putin demonstrates that he's actually interested in meaningful diplomacy, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=248.06s)]
*  it's unlikely to go anywhere. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=252.96s)]
*  The Biden administration did put an offer on the table when it comes to a prisoner swap [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=255.1s)]
*  with Russia. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=259.04s)]
*  That was back in July. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=260.12s)]
*  Two weeks ago, you said Russia has a failure to seriously negotiate. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=261.68s)]
*  Has that changed? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=267.72s)]
*  Is Russia serious now? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=268.72s)]
*  Margaret, as you know, we did put a significant proposal on the table many months ago, and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=270.2s)]
*  We've been engaged repeatedly in any way that we can to try to advance it and to look to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=275.88s)]
*  see if there are different permutations that could achieve what we're trying to achieve, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=284.06s)]
*  which is to get our people home. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=289.12s)]
*  Brittany Greiner, Paul Whelan, we're engaged in that on a regular basis, and it's my determination [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=291.08s)]
*  that we bring our people home. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=300.04s)]
*  We will not stop until we do. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=301.56s)]
*  But if these talks are now active and ongoing, as the White House said, that suggests you [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=303.16s)]
*  think there is some reason to believe they're serious now. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  You said they weren't serious a few weeks ago. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  As they say, Margaret, the proof will be in the pudding. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=316.32000000000005s)]
*  We have to see if the engagements that we've had, the discussions that we have produce [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=318.68s)]
*  an actual result. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=322.86s)]
*  That's the most important thing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=324.34000000000003s)]
*  But we are not resting on the laurels of having put forward a proposal some months ago. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=325.42s)]
*  We've been actively engaged over these many months to try to move things forward. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=331.96s)]
*  The offer for our viewers was to release convicted arms dealer known as the merchant of death, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=337.58s)]
*  Victor Boot. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=343.96s)]
*  There are two Americans being held. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  You named them right there, Brittany Greiner and Paul Whelan. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=346.28s)]
*  Brittany has been in custody for less than a year. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  Whelan, a former Marine, has been in captivity since 2018. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=352.64s)]
*  Russia wants a one-for-one swap. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=357.12s)]
*  How do you decide which American gets left behind? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=359.78s)]
*  So I'm not going to get into the details of this. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=363.17999999999995s)]
*  It would be counterproductive for me to get into the specifics of anything that we're [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=365.26s)]
*  saying or that the Russians are saying and that we're hearing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=368.78s)]
*  My determination is one way or another, as long as it takes, to get people home. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=371.94s)]
*  My efforts, the efforts of the entire administration, are to bring both Paul and Brittany home. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=377.02s)]
*  To bring them both home, but Russia wants a one-for-one swap? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=382.08s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to get into the details of where we are. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=385.05999999999995s)]
*  Russian media has been reporting. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=389.7s)]
*  So in your view, is it all or nothing? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=391.74s)]
*  Russian media reports a lot every day that I wouldn't necessarily take at face value. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=394.06s)]
*  So that's not what the Russians have told you? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=397.85999999999996s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to get into the details of it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=399.62s)]
*  Look, the other side gets a vote in this. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  It's not just what we want. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=406.0s)]
*  It's what they're prepared to do. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=407.68s)]
*  And this is something that we're working on almost every day. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=410.18s)]
*  And I know their families would love them home by Christmas, which is why I'm asking [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=414.34s)]
*  you. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=418.29999999999995s)]
*  Also, before I let you go, ask about Israel. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=419.3s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is on trial for corruption, but he right now is trying to piece together [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=423.66s)]
*  an alliance to form a government. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=427.7s)]
*  If he does, he'll become prime minister again. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=429.74s)]
*  I know you know this. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=431.98s)]
*  But he's been allying himself with figures who have spewed anti-Arab, anti-gay hate, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=433.82s)]
*  as well as discrimination against non-Orthodox Jews. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=439.94s)]
*  One of them wants to cancel gay pride parades. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=443.5s)]
*  At least two have called for mass deportations of Palestinians, including the man who may [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=445.98s)]
*  head Israel's police force. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=450.62s)]
*  Doesn't this makeup really jeopardize your intention to have peace in the region? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=454.1s)]
*  Margaret, we have worked and will continue to work with Israeli governments of every [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=461.14000000000004s)]
*  kind, just as Israeli governments have worked with American administrations of every kind. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=466.94s)]
*  And we're determined to do that going forward. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=471.86s)]
*  Our focus is less on personalities and more on policies. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=474.94s)]
*  The important thing is what policies does the government pursue? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=478.52s)]
*  The incoming government, at least, knows our views on a number of these issues. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=483.65999999999997s)]
*  But we have an absolute commitment to Israel's security. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=488.21999999999997s)]
*  That's not going to change. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=492.41999999999996s)]
*  And as we always have in the past, we'll speak directly to each other. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=494.06s)]
*  We'll be very clear about what we think and what we believe with our Israeli allies. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=497.97999999999996s)]
*  I'm sure they'll do the same. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=501.73999999999995s)]
*  And again, we'll focus on the policies, not the personalities. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=502.98s)]
*  But this extreme right-wing government, as it has been described, being put together, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=505.74s)]
*  does complicate your relationship? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=511.14s)]
*  Because then you also have to spend time talking about not canceling gay pride parades, not [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=514.1s)]
*  deporting people, all these policies here. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=518.0600000000001s)]
*  That's not what you want to focus on, which is settling peace, a two-state solution, which [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=521.62s)]
*  is being rejected by many of these figures. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=526.66s)]
*  I think we can run and chew gum at the same time. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=529.86s)]
*  So you are not concerned about this? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=533.14s)]
*  Again, we're going to focus on what the government does. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=534.94s)]
*  And as we have with every past Israeli government and as Israelis have with every past U.S. administration, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=538.66s)]
*  we'll work closely together. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=544.46s)]
*  Secretary Blinken, you're a busy man. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=546.26s)]
*  Thank you for your time this morning. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=548.26s)]
*  Thanks, Margaret. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=549.26s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKze_-TA1fg&t=550.26s)]
