# Gaza hospital workers are "overwhelmed," Doctors Without Borders International president says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA)
*  Christos Christou is president of Doctors Without Borders International and he joins us now from Rome. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=0.0s)]
*  I understand many of your doctors are working at Al-Shifa Hospital and said two infants died due to lack of electricity, the inability to keep incubators on. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=7.0s)]
*  There are 40 premature babies who need to evacuate. Will the Israeli military help these children evacuate? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=19.5s)]
*  So far we don't have any news about any coordinated action about evacuating at least these neonate patients. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=29.0s)]
*  And we don't have any news about any proper evacuation. What we see are hundreds of patients that they have underwent surgery very soon and very recently. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=37.0s)]
*  And now they cannot be just take and walk out of the hospital. And next to them we have newborn babies that they needed, premature babies that they needed support. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=47.0s)]
*  They were supposed to be in incubators. No incubator works this moment in Al-Shifa. And actually Al-Shifa doesn't work. It's not functional anymore. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=58.0s)]
*  The prime minister of Israel has said there's no reason why we can't just take the patients out of the hospital. What's your response to that? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=66.0s)]
*  To evacuate a hospital you need time. You need weeks. It's not within 24 hours. And we say that several times in the past also. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=76.0s)]
*  That it takes a lot of good organization to evacuate the hospital. And next to this coordination it takes also a ceasefire. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=85.0s)]
*  We have reports that people trying to leave the hospital also have been shot down. And we had also accidents, snipers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=92.0s)]
*  And we don't know what is happening also sometimes inside the hospital in several places where they are bombed. There are airstrikes in the hospitals as well. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=101.0s)]
*  The Israeli military denies attacking the hospital complex. I know it's a large complex. But they claim that Hamas, as you know, has a command center in that hospital. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=111.0s)]
*  I realize you are speaking about very sensitive matters. But the lives of your staff are also in danger here. How does this get resolved? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=123.0s)]
*  First of all we need to understand that this moment inside hospitals are people. Are people in need? Are patients? Are children? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=135.0s)]
*  We have this acronym, WCNSF, wounded children of non-surviving families. We have several families that are there. And these are patients. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=144.0s)]
*  We need to understand that we have to protect the hospitals. Any attack in the medical care at the moment is an attack on humanity. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=156.0s)]
*  But Israel's military is going to go at that hospital if it is indeed Hamas' command center. I'm sure you understand that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=163.0s)]
*  You say it would take weeks to get everyone out? Is there any planning? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=174.0s)]
*  There is no planning. Everyone now lives. Even the health workers have been so overwhelmed and exhausted. And they are in a position at the moment that they cannot even offer anything. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=180.0s)]
*  So yes, since more likely it is not a proper evacuation, but it is a panic. It is a panic that we will end up with rubbles. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=191.0s)]
*  Allowing fuel in has been a big sticking point for Israel, which worries that Hamas will get the fuel. You need the fuel to keep the generators on. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=200.0s)]
*  Do you have any source of fuel to keep the electricity on to keep these people alive? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=212.0s)]
*  At the moment there is no fuel in the hospital. And we run out of fuel in other hospitals. And I cannot speak on behalf of all the hospitals in Gaza. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=219.0s)]
*  I know that there is no electricity. We didn't have connection in the internet. All these testimonies that you get from our colleagues like Dr. Mohammed Obaid. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=228.0s)]
*  Before was from yesterday. We lost contact later at night. We don't know what is happening in this right moment. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=237.0s)]
*  And we know since a long time that people do not have even access to drinkable water. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=244.0s)]
*  I don't even have the words to respond to what you just laid out, doctor. But thank you. And we wish your doctors well, along with their patients. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=249.0s)]
*  Thank you, Margaret. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3UFX7DTtA&t=264.0s)]
