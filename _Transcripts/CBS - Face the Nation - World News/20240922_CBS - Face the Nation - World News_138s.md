# Hezbollah responds to Israeli strikes with rocket strikes deep into Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg)
*  Hezbollah responded to Israel's strikes by firing over 100 rockets deep into Israel overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=0.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Lifsay has the latest from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=8.0s)]
*  A barrage of Hezbollah rockets and drones pierced the stillness of northern Israel this morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=12.68s)]
*  Israel says most were intercepted by the Iron Dome defenses, but some found their target, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=20.96s)]
*  like this strike near Haifa, which left three wounded and one dead when a teenager lost control of his vehicle. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=26.68s)]
*  All of it in response to this. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=33.08s)]
*  An Israeli attack on Friday in southern Beirut that killed top Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Akil, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=36.2s)]
*  who will be buried later today following the funerals of other commanders who died in the strike. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=43.08s)]
*  The Akil strike came after two days of devastating attacks on thousands of Hezbollah militants. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=50.44s)]
*  The Israeli military says the war's center of gravity is now moving north towards Hezbollah and away from Hamas. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=57.16s)]
*  But Israel hasn't forgotten about Gaza. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=64.96s)]
*  Today, a school where hundreds were sheltering was struck west of Gaza City. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=68.28s)]
*  This just a day after the Hamas-run health ministry set a strike on another shelter-turned-school, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=73.32s)]
*  left more than 20 people dead, half of them children, one of them a pregnant woman. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=79.12s)]
*  Israel said the school had been turned into a Hamas command center. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  In a separate instance, our CBS News team in Gaza filmed babies and children injured in a strike on their family home this morning. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=89.76s)]
*  In our Al Jazeera office in occupied West Bank has just been raided. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=97.16s)]
*  And in the West Bank, during a live broadcast, Israeli forces shut down the Ramallah bureau of broadcaster Al Jazeera. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=104.72000000000001s)]
*  As a journalist read the warrant, the Qatar-based network is accused of inciting and supporting terrorism. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=113.12s)]
*  So far, Israel has not claimed responsibility for those exploding beepers and walkie talkies, Margaret. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=120.76s)]
*  But today, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did say that Israel dealt Hezbollah, quote, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=126.08s)]
*  a sequence of blows it could not imagine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=130.92s)]
*  That was our Chris Lipsay from Tel Aviv. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnlt_diIMWg&t=135.52s)]
