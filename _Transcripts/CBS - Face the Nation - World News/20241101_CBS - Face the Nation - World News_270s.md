# Russia, North Korea publicly display diplomatic ties
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA)
*  Russia's top diplomat met with his North Korean counterpart Friday as Pyongyang sends thousands [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=0.0s)]
*  of troops to aid in the war with Ukraine. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=5.82s)]
*  The Russian and North Korean foreign ministers met in Moscow in a public display of their [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=9.5s)]
*  country's diplomatic ties. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=14.16s)]
*  The Pentagon says North Korea has deployed around 10,000 soldiers to Russia and that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=16.64s)]
*  the Kremlin likely plans to use them in frontline combat. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=21.8s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd joins us now for our weekly national [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=26.599999999999998s)]
*  security wrap up. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=31.52s)]
*  Sam, how significant is North Korea's support of Russia? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=33.04s)]
*  Well, in addition to the Russian and North Korean public display of affection this week, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=36.84s)]
*  this meeting between the foreign ministers, we have now learned from U.S. government officials [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=42.36s)]
*  that out of the thousands of North Korean troops that were sent to Russia, about 8,000 [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=47.08s)]
*  or so are now stationed very close to the Ukrainian border in a region known as Kursk. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=52.36s)]
*  In addition to that, these soldiers have reportedly received training in areas like drones, artillery, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=58.44s)]
*  and trench clearing and really look poised to enter Ukraine and to join the fight. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=64.48s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has been losing a significant amount of Russian soldiers on the battlefield [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=69.84s)]
*  and had to call in reinforcements from North Korea. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=74.4s)]
*  Now, U.S. government officials met this week in D.C. with the Chinese ambassador to the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=77.72s)]
*  United States. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  The goal of that meeting was to encourage China to use its significantly close relationship [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=85.36s)]
*  with Russia to encourage Russia to stop receiving support from North Korea. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=91.8s)]
*  We don't yet know if those conversations between the U.S. government and the People's Republic [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  of China will yield any result, but they're certainly quite significant. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=102.88s)]
*  Let's turn now to the Middle East, Sam, because last week you and I were talking after Israel [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  retaliated against Iran. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=112.0s)]
*  Do we expect any further escalation? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=114.12s)]
*  Well, there has been some reporting at the end of this week indicating that Iran may [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  strike Israel via Iranian proxies in Iraq. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  The goal here would be to some extent to deflect attribution for the attack onto these proxies [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=127.12s)]
*  in Iraq. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=134.76000000000002s)]
*  It would be likely directed and supplied by the regime in Iran. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=135.84s)]
*  Israel is reportedly at a high level of readiness in anticipation of a potential Iranian retaliation, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=140.04s)]
*  as well as just more broadly because of the overall threat environment facing the country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  We understand that this week two senior U.S. government officials, my former colleagues [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=151.04s)]
*  Brett McGurk and Amos Hoxdean, traveled to the Middle East to try to make progress on [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=155.84s)]
*  issues like Lebanon and Gaza, but we don't yet know if they accomplished anything significant. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=160.56s)]
*  Also this week in Israel, the Knesset, the Israeli parliament passed legislation that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  will make it incredibly more difficult for the U.N. agency that delivers relief to Palestinians [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=172.04s)]
*  in Gaza and the West Bank to operate. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=178.28s)]
*  Further heightening concerns that the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Palestinians [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=181.12s)]
*  in Gaza and the West Bank will continue to stay at a very low level. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=185.36s)]
*  Well Sam, with the final moments we have left, let's talk about the election security. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  How are officials trying to make sure that despite some of the candidates out there on [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=195.88000000000002s)]
*  the trails saying that we have to be really concerned about this, do officials say that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  the vote is in fact secure and protected? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=207.56s)]
*  What are they doing to make sure that that's the case? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=209.84s)]
*  Federal officials are clearly stating that our election infrastructure is more secure [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=213.12s)]
*  than ever and that our election integrity is more secure than ever. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=217.2s)]
*  So while there may be physical cyber and foreign malign influence efforts targeting our election, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  there's currently no indication that any vote will be changed or the outcome altered in [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  any way. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=233.16s)]
*  That said, officials at all levels of government, federal, state, and local are engaging in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  information and intelligence sharing and are in the final stages of operational preparedness [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  to guard against threats both on election day and during what could be a very complex [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=244.4s)]
*  threat environment from the time that polls close on Tuesday through inauguration. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  So they're talking to each other at all levels of government and encouraging individuals [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=255.68s)]
*  to check the sources of information that they're digesting to stay vigilant and to exercise [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=260.6s)]
*  their democratic right to vote, Lana. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=265.32s)]
*  All right, Sam Vinograd, thank you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXAGTOs8eA&t=267.08s)]
