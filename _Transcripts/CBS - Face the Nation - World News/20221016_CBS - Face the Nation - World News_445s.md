# Markarova says global response if Russia uses nuclear weapons has to be "very harsh"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE)
*  We are joined now by Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=0.0s)]
*  Madam Ambassador, good to have you back. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Let's pick up where my colleague just left off. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=7.16s)]
*  Last time, President Zelensky was on this program at the end of September. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=10.08s)]
*  He talked specifically about the delivery of air defense systems, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  thanking the United States. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=17.84s)]
*  But they still have not been delivered. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=19.56s)]
*  What is the holdup in the delivery of American weapons? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=21.36s)]
*  Thank you for having me and thank you for talking about that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=24.88s)]
*  Yes, we still need all the weapons we are talking about, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=27.4s)]
*  with air defense being a priority after these horrible strikes that we're all seeing, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=30.72s)]
*  returning not only to select cities, but everywhere in Ukraine, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=35.12s)]
*  and especially in Kyiv and infrastructure before the winter. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=38.92s)]
*  Unfortunately, these systems are difficult to produce [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=43.36s)]
*  and they're not ready on the shelves waiting. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=48.72s)]
*  But we're doing everything possible and asking our partners to do everything possible [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  to speed up not only the delivery, but also the ordering of the system. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=54.08s)]
*  So hopefully you heard your president being very clear on trying to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=58.56s)]
*  accelerate the delivery of those. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  And we are counting on more systems to be announced and decisions taken to produce, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=65.8s)]
*  because we do need to secure as many places in Ukraine as possible, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=71.84s)]
*  as many children in Ukraine as possible from Russian rockets. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=77.12s)]
*  The Pentagon has said it's still about a month before those NASAMs come. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=80.64s)]
*  Let's talk about what we just heard on Friday from Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  He said that the mobilization drive to increase the number of soldiers [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=90.36s)]
*  will end in the next two weeks and that massive strikes are no longer needed. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=94.32s)]
*  What does your government assess he means by this? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  What are you preparing for? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=102.52s)]
*  Well, as we said, you know, 235 days, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=104.72s)]
*  no limits and no moral restrictions from Russian aggressor. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  So we should be prepared for everything. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=113.24s)]
*  And it's actually irrelevant at this point what he says, because this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=115.32s)]
*  partial mobilization has been a big failure. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  People in Russia do not want to be mobilized. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  They are not equipped, they are not prepared, they are not motivated. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=126.56s)]
*  Yes, there are a lot of them, but it has been a failure in Russia. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  They are probably not forcing it because they will have the planned mobilization [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=134.76s)]
*  in the autumn. We don't know. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=139.24s)]
*  All we all we are focused on in staying the course [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=142.24s)]
*  and defending our country everywhere and being prepared for [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=146.72s)]
*  anything that can come from the Russian Federation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=151.2s)]
*  We have seen all the war crimes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=153.52s)]
*  We have seen all the rocket attacks. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=155.32s)]
*  We have seen them using this Iranian Shaheed drones on civilian [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=157.4s)]
*  residential areas, killing families. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=161.24s)]
*  So what he says is actually irrelevant because what they do [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=163.6s)]
*  and everyone see what they do, this is what we have to pay attention to. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=168.12s)]
*  I want to ask you about billionaire Elon Musk. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=172.84s)]
*  He seemed to have reversed his position yesterday, at least publicly, in saying [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=177.68s)]
*  that Starlink, which is an Internet service that he has made available [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  in Ukraine, which has helped your military communicate on the battlefield, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  that he will pay for it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=191.28s)]
*  This was after some back and forth to the Pentagon about not paying for it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=192.36s)]
*  What's the bottom line? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  Can your military depend on this for communication or not? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=196.96s)]
*  Well, look, I had disagreed with Elon Musk on some of his views about Crimea, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  and we were happy to discuss it with him. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=205.16000000000003s)]
*  But with regard to the company, we have started cooperation with Starlink, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=207.52s)]
*  excellent cooperation. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  Before this phase of the war, we got the Starlink in Ukraine very quickly [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  in some areas for humanitarian support. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=217.36s)]
*  It's the only connection that we have, and it's very important to continue having it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=220.55999999999997s)]
*  And I'm positive that we will find a solution there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=224.44s)]
*  So it's not resolved yet? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=227.44s)]
*  It's there. It's working. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=229.64s)]
*  We will need to be working for a longer time. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=231.2s)]
*  And look, we are proud to be one of the fastest growing Starlink country [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  globally, too. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=238.56s)]
*  But the payment, who's going to pay it? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=239.72s)]
*  I'm sure we will find the solution there. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  Because the Financial Times had reported that there were outages [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=244.83999999999997s)]
*  from the satellites that had a direct impact on the battlefield, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=247.72s)]
*  particularly in the east of the country. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=251.16s)]
*  Is this payment dispute hurting your military? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=253.24s)]
*  Well, look, there is no payment dispute per se. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=256.88s)]
*  I mean, there are discussions on that we need more and where we need them [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=259.64s)]
*  and how we will need them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=264.08s)]
*  But the actual reason for the outages is Russian aggression [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=265.16s)]
*  and the fact that they are bombing our infrastructure and this [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=269.28s)]
*  disrupting the connectivity [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=272.92s)]
*  of all the cellular operators and trying to interfere also with others. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  We're trying to resolve it in many possible ways. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=281.8s)]
*  And Starlink has been instrumental part of the solution. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=284.8s)]
*  France's president drew a lot of scrutiny this week because he said, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=289.16s)]
*  if Russia carries out a nuclear attack on your country, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  that his country would not respond with nuclear weapons. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=295.76000000000005s)]
*  What exactly is the level of risk right now [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=300.32000000000005s)]
*  from the nuclear threat, whether it's from tactical weapons [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=304.8s)]
*  on the battlefield or what's happening at your nuclear power plant? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=308.68s)]
*  We cannot rule out anything. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=313.76s)]
*  And as you as you said, you know, the nuclear threat is already there [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=316.0s)]
*  because Russians illegally control one of the largest nuclear plant in Europe. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=319.64s)]
*  And the situation there deteriorates as it's not returned to Ukraine [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=324.32s)]
*  because it's the personnel there is not in the in the quantity [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=328.6s)]
*  that needs to be there. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=332.68s)]
*  They are threatened by Russians. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=334.32s)]
*  We don't know exactly what happens to them. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=336.48s)]
*  And the station has to be returned to Ukraine in order to decrease the risk. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=339.6s)]
*  So this is a big risk. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  And we need Russia to get out with regard to the use of nuclear weapons. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=345.04s)]
*  I think, again, it's it's issue. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=350.52s)]
*  It's much bigger than Ukraine. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=352.0s)]
*  We in Ukraine will resist and we will not give up [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  regardless of what Russian Federation is using against us. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=357.72s)]
*  We have, I think, proven it from rockets to atrocities [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  to anything that they try to to to do in Ukraine. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=365.88s)]
*  It doesn't break our will. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  So there is no point for Russian Federation to use anything else [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=372.0s)]
*  because it will not stop us in defending our homes with regard to the global response. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  It has to be very harsh even for the talks of Russian Federation [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=380.88s)]
*  and Putin about using the nuclear weapons, because this is a clear red line. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=385.24s)]
*  This is on, you know, on what the whole security [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=390.64s)]
*  infrastructure of Europe and global is built. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=394.55999999999995s)]
*  When the French president says something like that, does it muddy that line? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  Does it blur that line? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=400.28s)]
*  Well, I just I just hope that everyone understands that the way it should be understood. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=401.96s)]
*  In 1994, Ukraine became the country that voluntarily gave up [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=407.2s)]
*  the third largest nuclear arsenal and received assurances. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  Of our safety, because we gave up our nuclear weapons. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=417.32s)]
*  And if a nuclear weapon will be used by nuclear power [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=421.76s)]
*  and aggressor against non nuclear country like Ukraine, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=426.08s)]
*  then the whole nuclear deterrence system is going to be under risk. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=429.92s)]
*  So I think we all together cannot allow Russian Federation to use it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=436.84s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you very much for your time. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF6BaNqIyRE&t=441.68s)]
