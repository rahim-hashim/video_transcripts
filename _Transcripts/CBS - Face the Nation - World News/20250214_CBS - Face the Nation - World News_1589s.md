# Trump holds joint news conference with India's Modi | full video
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o)
*  We will have more on that in a moment, but we do want to take you back to the White House where President Trump and Prime Minister Modi are taking questions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=0.0s)]
*  We have seen several groups in the US being raising anti-India voice, calling about separation, terrorism activities in India. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=7.0s)]
*  Do you think that should continue here in the US as well? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=15.0s)]
*  You're going to have to go louder. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=18.0s)]
*  Mr. President, people in India would be welcoming your decision to extradite the HUB or RANA to India. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=20.0s)]
*  I can't understand a word he's saying. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=25.0s)]
*  May I, sir? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=27.0s)]
*  May I? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=29.0s)]
*  May I, sir? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=31.0s)]
*  Go ahead, back there. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=33.0s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=34.0s)]
*  First, I want to ask the Prime Minister a question. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=35.0s)]
*  You and the President, you both spoke about combating ISIS. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=38.0s)]
*  You both sounded very excited about this partnership upcoming. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=42.0s)]
*  And I was curious, how much more confident are you with President Trump leading this country that there will be peace through strength and you will have a successful partnership with the United States versus with Biden's incompetence and weakness over the last four years? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=48.0s)]
*  That's your question, but I'll answer it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=68.0s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=78.0s)]
*  Gross incompetence. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=80.0s)]
*  We're going to have a fantastic relationship. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=82.0s)]
*  And it has been, look, the whole world's been set back over the last four years by the weakness of the United States, the weak leadership of the United States. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=85.0s)]
*  And I think we've taken care of it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=93.0s)]
*  In just three weeks, it seems to me that even some of the media that we wouldn't prefer has been writing that this is a much different country right now, that the world has a light over it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=95.0s)]
*  Not only our country, but the whole world. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=106.0s)]
*  The Prime Minister told me that before, too, even over India. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=109.0s)]
*  The world has a light. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=112.0s)]
*  They need the United States to be strong and powerful, but good. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=113.0s)]
*  And I think that's happened. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=117.0s)]
*  And I think it's happened in a very short period of time. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=119.0s)]
*  But I will tell you, we're going to have a fantastic relationship and it'll make both countries much stronger. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=121.0s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=127.0s)]
*  Okay, Geeta Mohan from India Today, sir. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=133.0s)]
*  I'll just take my colleague Lalit Jha's question forward because you can understand. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=141.0s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=145.0s)]
*  The question is about the fact that you've decided to extradite the Havarana. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=147.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=152.0s)]
*  India has been waiting to have him back in India to bring him to justice. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=153.0s)]
*  But there are many other elements in the United States of America, particularly Khalistani separatists who've been working against Indian interests. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=159.0s)]
*  How is the United States of America going to cooperate on that front with India? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=168.0s)]
*  There have been allegations that have been leveled against Indian agencies by the Biden administration. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=173.0s)]
*  Are you going to relook that with Tulsi Gabbard as DNI now? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=179.0s)]
*  Well, I don't think India had a very good relationship with the Biden administration. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=184.0s)]
*  Biden, they wouldn't sell them oil and gas, which is rather hard to believe because it's a good thing to do. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=188.0s)]
*  And a lot of things happened that weren't very appropriate, I thought, between India and the administration, the Biden administration. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=195.0s)]
*  But as you said, we're giving a very violent man, it seems to me. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=201.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know that he's been convicted yet or will be, but let's assume he's a pretty violent person. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=207.0s)]
*  We're giving him back to India immediately. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=213.0s)]
*  And there are more to follow because we have quite a few requests. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=216.0s)]
*  So we work with India on crime and we want to make it good for India. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=220.0s)]
*  And it's very important. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=225.0s)]
*  So that kind of a relationship is very important to us. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=226.0s)]
*  OK, go ahead, please. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=229.0s)]
*  Thank you. Mr. President, you've repeatedly called India a big abuser of trade and said it is really difficult to do business in India because of tariffs. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=236.0s)]
*  You announced reciprocal tariffs today. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=246.0s)]
*  I am hoping you can speak about what kind of reciprocal tariffs India can expect. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=249.0s)]
*  Are you willing to make any concessions? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=254.0s)]
*  And how can India head off these tariffs? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=257.0s)]
*  I also have one for the prime minister. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=259.0s)]
*  Well, it has been to us just about the highest tariffed nation anywhere in the world. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=262.0s)]
*  They've been very strong on tariffs. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=269.0s)]
*  I don't blame them necessarily, but it's a different way of doing business. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=271.0s)]
*  It's very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=274.0s)]
*  We are right now a reciprocal nation. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=280.0s)]
*  We are going to if it's India or if it's somebody else with low tariffs, we're going to have the same. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=283.0s)]
*  We're going to have whatever India charges, we're charging them, whatever another country charges, we're charging them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=289.0s)]
*  So it's called reciprocal, which I think is a very fair way. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=294.0s)]
*  We didn't have that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=298.0s)]
*  We I was going to do that in my other term and we had the greatest economy ever in the world. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=299.0s)]
*  There's never been an economy like we had. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=305.0s)]
*  And then we got hit with covid. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=307.0s)]
*  We had to focus on that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=309.0s)]
*  And I wasn't really in the mood to be putting it on Italy and Spain and France and India, frankly, and a lot of other countries, because the world was very troubled until we got rid of that nightmare. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=310.0s)]
*  But we had the strongest economy anywhere in the world during that fairly long period of time during my first term, as you know, and we didn't do the tariffs. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=322.0s)]
*  We would have done the reciprocal tariffs, but we decided and I decided, I think on a human basis, on a humane basis not to do them because of the fact that there was such suffering all over the world. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=333.0s)]
*  The last thing we needed to talk about is trade problems. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=345.0s)]
*  But now we do. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=348.0s)]
*  We're doing we see a tremendous future for our country. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=349.0s)]
*  But we felt that now it's finally time after 45 or 50 years of abuse that we will do. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=353.0s)]
*  And this isn't India. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=359.0s)]
*  This is among a lot of nations. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=361.0s)]
*  The European Union is very difficult for us. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=363.0s)]
*  Very, very difficult. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=366.0s)]
*  They they tax our companies at levels that nobody's ever seen before. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=367.0s)]
*  They take advantage of a lot of things. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=372.0s)]
*  So we're not happy about that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=374.0s)]
*  China, of course, is terrible. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=375.0s)]
*  And we've never taken in 10 cents until I was president. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=377.0s)]
*  We've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars from China since I've been president in first term and and now. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=380.0s)]
*  And we have to do that just as a mechanism of fairness. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=387.0s)]
*  And that's what I've done. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=391.0s)]
*  And so we are being reciprocal with India, whatever India charges, we charge them. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=393.0s)]
*  So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge, because whatever they charge, I had discussions with India in the first term about the fact that their tariffs were very high. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=398.0s)]
*  And I was unable to get a concession. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=411.0s)]
*  So we're just going to do it the easy way. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=414.0s)]
*  We're just going to say whatever you charge, we charge. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=416.0s)]
*  And I think that's fair for the people of the United States. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=418.0s)]
*  And I think it's actually fair for India. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=421.0s)]
*  Are you willing to make any concessions? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=423.0s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=429.0s)]
*  Ask to the Prime Minister, please. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=432.0s)]
*  Ask to the Prime Minister, please. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=434.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=436.0s)]
*  Yoshita Singh with Press Trust of India. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=437.0s)]
*  Prime Minister. Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=439.0s)]
*  Prime Minister, the U.S. is giving a lot of push to curb illegal immigration, and India has been cooperating on this issue. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=440.0s)]
*  How does India see this issue in the larger context? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=449.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=452.0s)]
*  I don't think this is a question that is about India only, but even globally you can talk about this issue. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=458.0s)]
*  And we are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, they have absolutely no right to be in that country. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=464.0s)]
*  And as far as India and the U.S. is concerned, we have always been of the same opinion, and that is that any verified Indian who is in the U.S. illegally, we are fully prepared to take them back to India. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=485.0s)]
*  However, it doesn't stop there. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=509.0s)]
*  These are children of very ordinary families, and they are lured by big dreams and big promises. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=515.0s)]
*  A lot of them are brought in without them knowing about why they're going to a country. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=523.0s)]
*  And in fact, they are connected with a human trafficking system, and we have to make sure that we fight against this system. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=531.0s)]
*  As far as the U.S. and India is concerned, I think what we should do is make efforts to make sure that we uproot these from within the system so that we can reduce or remove human trafficking. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=539.0s)]
*  And basically the young, vulnerable, poor people of India are fooled into coming over as illegal immigrants. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=556.0s)]
*  And our bigger fight actually is against this ecosystem or this system that encourages such gangs to thrive. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=565.0s)]
*  And I can tell you that India will completely support your endeavor in achieving this. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=573.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=581.0s)]
*  The question from Prime Minister Modi first, if I may. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=583.0s)]
*  I wanted to ask you, did you discuss any possible business deals with Elon Musk during your meetings today, Mr. Prime Minister? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=586.0s)]
*  And Mr. President, I wanted to ask you, today you spoke about hoping to have three-way talks with President Xi and President Putin. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=594.0s)]
*  But what would you say to European leaders and other allies who may be concerned that you're apparently more keen to speak to America's adversaries than to its allies? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=604.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=614.0s)]
*  Maybe I'll just go first on this one. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=615.0s)]
*  We had some talks and we told the European Union, we told the NATO people largely they overlap. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=619.0s)]
*  You have to pay more money because it's unfair what we're doing. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=630.0s)]
*  We're doing a tremendous amount more, we're probably $200 billion more going into Ukraine, using for Ukraine to fight. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=634.0s)]
*  And Europe has not really carried its weight in terms of the money. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=645.0s)]
*  It's not equitable. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=649.0s)]
*  And we want to see a counterbalance. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=651.0s)]
*  We want to have them put up more money. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=653.0s)]
*  They have to do that. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=655.0s)]
*  But at the same time, we had a very good conversation with President Putin the other day, yesterday, and we also had a very good conversation. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=656.0s)]
*  I did both in both cases with President Zelensky. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=663.0s)]
*  And I think we're going to be able to do something. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=667.0s)]
*  I think we're going to be able to make a deal. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=670.0s)]
*  And I hope so because it's a horrible war. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=672.0s)]
*  It's a very terrible, bloody war with a million and a half soldiers, at least already dead on the battlefield, lying all over the fields like nobody's ever seen anything like it since certainly since the Second World War. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=674.0s)]
*  And so I think we're going to be able to do something. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=685.0s)]
*  We're working with President Zelensky and with President Putin. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=688.0s)]
*  And my impression is that they I know that President Zelensky wants to make a deal. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=692.0s)]
*  And I also feel that I know that President Putin wants to make a deal. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=698.0s)]
*  I wanted to know that before I began any detailed discussions. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=702.0s)]
*  But the meeting and the conversation, also the meeting with Steve Witkoff in Moscow was a very successful one. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=706.0s)]
*  And my phone call with him was a very successful one. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=713.0s)]
*  Please. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=716.0s)]
*  You asked a question regarding Elon Musk. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=723.0s)]
*  I have known him for a very long time. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=727.0s)]
*  I was not even a prime minister at the time when I first met him. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=729.0s)]
*  I was chief minister. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=734.0s)]
*  And today he came to meet me along with all his family, with his children. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=736.0s)]
*  And so we had a nice discussion as far as the EV is concerned. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=741.0s)]
*  EVs are concerned. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=750.0s)]
*  The EV, the word EV has a copyright. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=753.0s)]
*  And that is one person who has a copyright for the word EV. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=757.0s)]
*  And that is Trump. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=761.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=772.0s)]
*  Can I ask whether you discussed at all today the case of Gautam Adani, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=774.0s)]
*  who's one of the wealthiest men in Asia and perceived as an ally of Prime Minister Modi? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=778.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi, have you asked the president to take action on that case? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=783.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=787.0s)]
*  Firstly, India is a democratic country. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=788.0s)]
*  And our culture and our thought, philosophy is Vasudeva Gautam Kamm, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=796.0s)]
*  which basically means that the entire world is a family. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=804.0s)]
*  Every Indian is my own family member. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=807.0s)]
*  And when it comes to such personal matters, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=810.0s)]
*  leaders of two countries will not get together on that topic [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=815.0s)]
*  and discuss anything on an individual matter. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=818.0s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=821.0s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=824.0s)]
*  Sir, go ahead, please. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=827.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=830.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=831.0s)]
*  I have a question for you as well. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=832.0s)]
*  But, Mr. President, you have suggested with regard to the idea of NATO membership, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=834.0s)]
*  territory that was seized back in 2014 by Russia. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=839.0s)]
*  What should Russia give up? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=842.0s)]
*  Russia has gotten themselves into something that I think they wish they didn't. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=845.0s)]
*  If I were president, it would not have happened. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=851.0s)]
*  Absolutely would not have happened. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=853.0s)]
*  And it didn't happen for four years. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=855.0s)]
*  If you look at what has taken place under President Bush, they lost a lot. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=857.0s)]
*  Under President Obama, they lost Crimea. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=863.0s)]
*  Under Biden, it looks like they could lose the whole thing. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=869.0s)]
*  Under Trump, they lost nothing. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=872.0s)]
*  Ukraine lost nothing. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=874.0s)]
*  They didn't give up anything. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=875.0s)]
*  And you take a look at the other three presidents surrounding me, they gave up a lot. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=877.0s)]
*  I think that when you look at Ukraine and when you look at the mess that they're in, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=883.0s)]
*  it's got to be ended and it's got to be stopped. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=889.0s)]
*  Now, Russia has taken over a pretty big chunk of territory. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=892.0s)]
*  And they also have said from day one long before President Putin, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=897.0s)]
*  they've said they cannot have Ukraine be a NATO. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=903.0s)]
*  They said that very strongly. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=905.0s)]
*  I actually think that that was the thing that caused the start of the war. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=907.0s)]
*  And Biden said it and Zelensky said it. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=911.0s)]
*  And I think that was one of the reasons, one of the starts of the war. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=915.0s)]
*  But from long before Putin, they said you cannot have Ukraine going in in any way into NATO. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=919.0s)]
*  And I start from that standpoint. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=927.0s)]
*  I think everybody knew that. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=931.0s)]
*  Now, if a better deal can be negotiated, if they're able to make a deal where they can do that, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=933.0s)]
*  that's fine with me. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=939.0s)]
*  I really don't care. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=940.0s)]
*  I want that bloodshed to stop. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=941.0s)]
*  I don't want to see, you know, we have an ocean between us. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=944.0s)]
*  And the site we're talking about, the site of death, we're calling it the fields of death, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=947.0s)]
*  we have a big ocean in between us. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=953.0s)]
*  This is more important for Europe. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=955.0s)]
*  We shouldn't be in. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=957.0s)]
*  They have to equalize. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=958.0s)]
*  And they're going to have to do it fast, but they have to equalize. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=959.0s)]
*  But as far as the negotiation, it's too early to say what's going to happen. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=962.0s)]
*  Maybe Russia will give up a lot. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=967.0s)]
*  Maybe they won't. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=969.0s)]
*  And it's all dependent on what is going to happen. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=970.0s)]
*  The negotiation really hasn't started. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=973.0s)]
*  But I will say, as far as NATO is concerned, from many years before President Putin, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=975.0s)]
*  I will tell you that I've heard that Russia would never accept that. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=980.0s)]
*  And I think Ukraine knew that because Ukraine wasn't in and never requested to be in until more recently. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=984.0s)]
*  So that's the way it is. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=990.0s)]
*  And I think that's the way it's going to have to be. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=991.0s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=994.0s)]
*  All right, go ahead, please, with the tie. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=997.0s)]
*  With the tie, yeah. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=999.0s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1002.0s)]
*  Yes, go ahead. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1003.0s)]
*  This is Saurabh Shukla from News War Bill. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1004.0s)]
*  Mr. President, you spoke about Prime Minister Modi as a tough negotiator. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1006.0s)]
*  Who was a tougher negotiator today and who has a better negotiating tactic when it comes to tariffs? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1010.0s)]
*  Oh, he's a much tougher negotiator than me, and he's a much better negotiator than me. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1015.0s)]
*  There's not even a contest. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1020.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1022.0s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead, please. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1028.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1029.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1030.0s)]
*  Reena Bhardwaj from ANI. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1031.0s)]
*  How do you see this relationship between the India and the United States to counter China? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1033.0s)]
*  And what is your vision when it comes to India, you know, brokering peace in the Ukraine and Russia conflict? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1039.0s)]
*  Well, I think we're going to have a very good relationship with China. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1048.0s)]
*  I got along with President Xi very well until COVID. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1051.0s)]
*  That was a bridge too far. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1054.0s)]
*  But until then, I got along with President Xi very, very well. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1056.0s)]
*  We were very close as leaders go. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1059.0s)]
*  I don't want to be naive, but as leaders go, I think we were very close. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1062.0s)]
*  And I think that China is a very important player in the world. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1067.0s)]
*  I think they can help us get this war over with Ukraine and Russia. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1071.0s)]
*  And I look at India, I do see the skirmishes on the border, which are quite vicious. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1075.0s)]
*  And I guess they continue to go on. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1081.0s)]
*  If I could be of help, I'd love to help because that should be stopped. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1084.0s)]
*  That's been going on for a long time. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1087.0s)]
*  And it's quite violent. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1089.0s)]
*  It's quite violent. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1091.0s)]
*  But I would hope that China and India and Russia and U.S. and all of us can get along. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1092.0s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1099.0s)]
*  You know, the power of weaponry today is, and not only nuclear, but nuclear in particular, the power of weaponry is very important. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1101.0s)]
*  I said before that I had very constructive talks in my first term with President Putin about the denuclearization of the two countries. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1109.0s)]
*  And then we were going to go to China after we worked some kind of a deal. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1120.0s)]
*  And we had the confines of a deal. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1124.0s)]
*  We were, I thought he really wanted to do it. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1126.0s)]
*  So did I denuclearize. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1129.0s)]
*  And it's so it's such a beautiful term when you think about it. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1131.0s)]
*  In other words, to bring it down because the power of those weapons is too great. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1135.0s)]
*  And I did speak to President Xi about that, and I was getting also a very good response. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1140.0s)]
*  He's building a very strong nuclear power. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1145.0s)]
*  He's not very close to Russia or the United States right now, but he will be soon. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1149.0s)]
*  I mean, he'll catch up over the period of four or five years, they say. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1153.0s)]
*  But it would be a great thing if we could, on a military basis. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1158.0s)]
*  We're going to spend this year 900, let's say 915 billion dollars on military Russia without the war was spending close to 100. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1161.0s)]
*  But with the war, I can't tell you what they're spending, but they're spending a lot in China spending 400 and 450 billion dollars. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1171.0s)]
*  We're over 900 billion dollars. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1178.0s)]
*  And I said, you know, it doesn't really make sense as it were spending the money against each other. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1180.0s)]
*  And we could spend that money for better purpose if we get along. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1187.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you, I think that something like that will happen. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1191.0s)]
*  First, when I left, as you know, four years ago, we didn't have Israel and the Middle East. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1195.0s)]
*  We didn't have October 7th, a disaster, the disaster. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1201.0s)]
*  Nothing was happening. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1206.0s)]
*  Iran was not going to do anything because Iran did not have much money at that point. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1207.0s)]
*  They were broke. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1212.0s)]
*  They were totally broke. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1213.0s)]
*  They didn't have money for Hamas or for Hezbollah. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1214.0s)]
*  And you didn't have Russia with Ukraine. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1217.0s)]
*  And that would never have happened. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1219.0s)]
*  But now I come back and I have the whole world is on fire. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1221.0s)]
*  So I have to put out the fires. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1224.0s)]
*  But after I put out the fires, I'm going to meet with China and I'm going to meet with Russia. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1225.0s)]
*  And we're going to see if we can de-escalate, if we can bring it down military, especially as it pertains to nuclear. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1229.0s)]
*  Please. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1236.0s)]
*  Mike, please. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1245.0s)]
*  Prime Minister, how do you see India's role? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1254.0s)]
*  You have had discussions with President Trump about de-escalating the conflict in Russia and Ukraine. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1258.0s)]
*  As you know, I have been in constant contact with both Russia and Ukraine. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1267.0s)]
*  I have also visited both countries. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1277.0s)]
*  And many peoples are mistaken and they feel that India is neutral. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1280.0s)]
*  I would like to clarify, India is not neutral. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1286.0s)]
*  We have taken a side and we have taken the side of peace. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1290.0s)]
*  And it is based on this principle of ours that in the presence of President Putin, I clearly said in front of the media that this is not the era of war. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1297.0s)]
*  And even today, it is my conviction that solutions cannot be found on the battlefield. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1315.0s)]
*  Ultimately, you have to come to the negotiating table. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1323.0s)]
*  And India has constantly made efforts that there are talks that take place where both parties are present. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1327.0s)]
*  It is only then that we will find a solution. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1337.0s)]
*  The efforts being made by President Trump, I support them. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1340.0s)]
*  I welcome them. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1346.0s)]
*  And I would like that President Trump is successful as soon as possible so that the world is on the path to peace once again. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1348.0s)]
*  Everybody, thank you very much. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1358.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1361.0s)]
*  We've been listening to President Trump speak alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1362.0s)]
*  President Trump addressed reciprocal tariffs and trade negotiations with India, reiterating that the U.S. would match tariffs imposed by other nations. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1366.0s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1374.0s)]
*  Major, the president saying he had discussions with India in his first term that their tariffs were too high. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1378.0s)]
*  They do charge average of 12 percent tariffs, which is one of the high among the highest countries of course. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1384.0s)]
*  According to one of our sources that he wasn't able to get a concession from India in his first term and said, we'll do it the easy way and say whatever you charge, we charge. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1390.0s)]
*  But notably, we didn't get Modi's perspective on that. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1398.0s)]
*  No, we didn't. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1402.0s)]
*  Most foreign leaders in these conversations with President Trump understand that the threat of tariffs is something that is negotiable across all goods imported into the United States. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1403.0s)]
*  The average of tariffs imposed by India is about $1.5 billion. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1413.0s)]
*  If you equallized that, that would mean either the Indian tariffs have to come down or U.S. ones would go up. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1417.0s)]
*  This is all subject to negotiation and one of the things that they're negotiating about is arms purchases from the United States. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1423.0s)]
*  India is one of the largest consumers of military machinery in the world. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1430.0s)]
*  India is a country that has a very different system than the U.S. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1436.0s)]
*  India is one of the largest consumers of military machinery in the world. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1442.0s)]
*  Its largest supplier currently, Russia. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1447.22s)]
*  Sixty-two percent of India's military imports come from Russia. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1449.76s)]
*  The United States would like to eat into that Russian supply of military equipment that [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1453.28s)]
*  goes into India. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1457.88s)]
*  And there are conversations going on right now on a joint combat vehicle and a joint [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1458.88s)]
*  aircraft to be made by the United States with India. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1464.18s)]
*  That's one of the things this administration is trying to negotiate with India. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1468.2s)]
*  And the threat of terrorists is part of the leverage of that conversation. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1472.52s)]
*  We know that Modi met with Elon Musk and he was asked whether he made any business deals. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1475.8s)]
*  We didn't really get clarity on that other than Modi saying that he's known him for a [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1480.1200000000001s)]
*  long time and that Trump has a copyright on EVs. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1483.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not sure about the whole copyright on EV things, but it is worth pointing out [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1485.52s)]
*  that Tesla is losing a bit of market share. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1491.0800000000002s)]
*  One of its biggest competitors and rivals is EVs manufactured in China. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1495.32s)]
*  And Elon Musk would very much like Tesla to get into the Indian EV market. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1500.8799999999999s)]
*  That I'm sure was part of the conversation, but the Indian prime minister was nothing [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1505.56s)]
*  if not opaque on the specifics. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1509.6799999999998s)]
*  What else did you take away from that, Major? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1511.52s)]
*  So the Indian prime minister said it is perceived that India is neutral in the war between Russia [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1513.8799999999999s)]
*  and Ukraine, where Russia was the aggressor. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1520.26s)]
*  Why does that perception exist? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1523.3999999999999s)]
*  Because when that war began, when Russia invaded Ukraine, India, the world's largest democracy, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1526.24s)]
*  had nothing to say about it. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1531.08s)]
*  Did maintain for months and months and months a position of neutrality, not saying that [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1532.8799999999999s)]
*  Russia had done what everyone else had fairly concluded that it had done, imposed itself [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1538.6s)]
*  upon the sovereignty of a democratic country, Ukraine. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1543.84s)]
*  India did not weigh in on that at all, much to the consternation of the Biden administration [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1548.12s)]
*  and many in Congress, Republicans and Democrats. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1552.44s)]
*  Now the prime minister says, well, we're for peace. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1555.4s)]
*  But on what terms? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1558.1200000000001s)]
*  And when you listen to President Trump talking about President Putin in Russia, about China, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1559.1200000000001s)]
*  which is allied with Russia in its war against Ukraine, and India saying, well, we just want [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1563.96s)]
*  peace, but never really saying that Russia was the snarling aggressor in that war. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1567.96s)]
*  You have to feel, as many Europeans do, and the Ukrainians fear, that the contours of [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1572.84s)]
*  a future negotiated settlement might not represent Ukraine's interests as strongly as certainly [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1577.36s)]
*  President Zelensky would like or Ukrainian people would like. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1582.32s)]
*  Major Garrett setting the record straight. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1585.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1587.3999999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxB13q04N_o&t=1588.3999999999999s)]
