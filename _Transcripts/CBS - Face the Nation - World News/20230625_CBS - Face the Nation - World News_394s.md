# Putin-Wagner truce is "evidence of weakness," says former U.S. ambassador to Russia John Sullivan
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8)
*  For more on the situation in Russia, we turn to CBS News national security correspondent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=0.0s)]
*  David Martin and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, now a CBS News contributor, John Sullivan. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=4.76s)]
*  Good to have both of you here. David, let's start on just what happened on the ground. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=10.52s)]
*  124 miles outside of Moscow. That's how far the Wagner Group says they got. What does [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=17.2s)]
*  this tell us about Russia's intelligence and military? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=24.2s)]
*  Well, it came as a surprise to U.S. intelligence. They had some warning that there was going [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=27.56s)]
*  to be a mutiny. But they were surprised when the Russians put up no resistance, allowed [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=35.04s)]
*  Pugosian to go into their military headquarters in Rostov and then send his army unopposed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  north toward Moscow. And then they were surprised again by how quickly a deal was made. They [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=54.64s)]
*  had expected a longer, more violent affair. And that's why people like the national security [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=63.64s)]
*  advisor, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff canceled their travel plans because there [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=71.16s)]
*  was the danger that this mutiny could mushroom into a civil war. And that brings up all sorts [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=76.36s)]
*  of concerns about the security of Russia's nuclear weapons. And what you learn is that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=84.96s)]
*  when a person like Putin is sitting on top an arsenal of thousands of nuclear weapons, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=90.96s)]
*  his problems very quickly become your problems. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  And Ambassador, I mean, it sounds strange sometimes that phrase catastrophic success [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  when foreign policy analysts talk about it. But are we actually in a situation where Vladimir [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  Putin is preferable to Yevgeny Pugosian in terms of running the Russian state? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=111.36s)]
*  Well, he's certainly a known quantity. He's a hardened adversary of the United States, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=116.0s)]
*  but the alternative could be worse. So I think the Biden administration is rightfully concerned, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=121.12s)]
*  as David suggests, with chaos and uncertainty in Russia with their nuclear arsenal is very [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=126.72s)]
*  dangerous, not just for the United States, but for the world. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=131.76s)]
*  So when you look at the map, Rostov, the city that you mentioned, it's a major logistics hub [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=134.72s)]
*  on that route to Moscow. Do we have any insight yet, David, into what's happening within the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=141.28s)]
*  Russian military right now? Are they remaining loyal to Vladimir Putin? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=148.56s)]
*  There was no sign that any of the security apparatus around Putin had switched sides. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=153.2s)]
*  They seemed to hang tough with Putin. The question of why there was no Russian resistance, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=166.16s)]
*  I mean, one possible explanation is because Putin told them not to resist. We're going to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=174.16s)]
*  settle this as quickly and as peacefully as possible. Ambassador, it was a surprise to many [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=180.56s)]
*  when it was Belarus that announced that they were the brokers here, that the president of that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=189.52s)]
*  country. Now, that country is pretty much viewed as a vassal state of Russia. Vladimir Putin [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=194.24s)]
*  controls it. There are nuclear weapons that Vladimir Putin says he's putting there. Explain [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=200.32s)]
*  this part of the puzzle. Why would Yevgeny Purgoshin move to Belarus? Why are they suddenly [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=205.44s)]
*  appearing to be power brokers? Well, as you point out, Margaret, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=212.72s)]
*  Lukashenko is in power now as president because of Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin came to his rescue [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=216.4s)]
*  in August 2020. It was Lukashenko who was dependent on Putin. But now, think about this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=222.8s)]
*  This is, as you note, Belarus is part of a union state with Russia. They are conjoined. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=230.56s)]
*  How dependent now is Putin on Lukashenko? It's evidence of the weakness that this reveals what's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=236.96s)]
*  happened in the last three or four days, the weakness of Vladimir Putin. It's not just [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=242.56s)]
*  an appearance of weakness, it's actual weakness. A person that he has said is a traitor who has [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  stabbed him and his nation in the back. He struck a deal with, a deal that he needed to strike to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=255.92s)]
*  avoid bloodshed and chaos. What strong leader does that? Exactly. And when you look at, I think for [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  so many Americans who are learning about Wagner Group for the first time, and they just heard [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=270.08s)]
*  Deborah's great reporting there, the U.S. considers them a transnational criminal organization. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  Is this like the mafia has its own military? I mean, how do we think about this? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=280.0s)]
*  Well, Prigogine himself spent most of the 1980s in prison because he's a career criminal. Wagner [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=283.68s)]
*  operates in states in Africa and elsewhere, not because they're patriots who are executing [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=291.36s)]
*  policy on behalf of the Russian government. They're there to get access to gold mines, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=298.56s)]
*  oil resources and so forth. This is a money-making organization, corrupt organization, that the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=304.64s)]
*  United States correctly treats as a transnational criminal organization. And that's what, David, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=310.0s)]
*  it was interesting to hear from both the secretary and Mike Turner, this concern of what happens next, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=314.96s)]
*  not just in Ukraine, but in Libya, in Syria, throughout Africa. Do we have any concept yet? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=320.56s)]
*  Does this become a separate company? Does this become part of the Russian military? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=327.44s)]
*  Well, I somehow don't think that Prigogine has gone to Belarus to live out his days in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=331.36s)]
*  idle exile. I don't think he's out of the game. And although there's been this deal with Vladimir [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=338.64s)]
*  Putin, who says Vladimir Putin is going to deliver on the deal? I mean, if I were Prigogine, I would [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=347.44s)]
*  keep my bodyguards close and my food taster closer because poison is one of Putin's favorite [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=355.36s)]
*  instruments of getting revenge. He has a force of what? 25,000 under his command, allegedly? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=363.44s)]
*  That's what he's credited for. He was at the start of this year, he was credited with 50,000. And I [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=371.84s)]
*  think the drop from 50 to 25,000 is a measure of how much they lost in the fighting in eastern Ukraine. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=378.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=387.76s)]
*  This was great to have your analysis and your reporting. Thank you both. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtCQCgE3WQ8&t=388.88s)]
