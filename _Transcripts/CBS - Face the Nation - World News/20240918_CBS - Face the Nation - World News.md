# Reports of more exploding devices in Lebanon a day after deadly pager explosions
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ)
*  And now to this more explosions are being reported across Lebanon today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=0.0s)]
*  leaving at least nine people dead and injuring more than 300. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=4.48s)]
*  Hezbollah's news outlet reports these explosions were the result of walkie [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=8.72s)]
*  talkies detonating. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=13.32s)]
*  Lebanon state run news agency says several old pager devices exploded in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=15.08s)]
*  other areas during funeral processions for Hezbollah members killed in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=19.44s)]
*  yesterday's detonations. According to local health officials, at least 12 [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=23.48s)]
*  people are dead and thousands injured across Lebanon in yesterday's explosion [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  and that it does include civilians. Hezbollah blames Israel, but Israel is [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  refusing to comment on the attack. Now, all of this is happening while the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=36.36s)]
*  man you see there, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is in the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=40.4s)]
*  Middle East speaking with Egypt's president in hopes of defusing the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  escalating tensions and reaching a ceasefire deal in Gaza. Blinken addressed [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=47.72s)]
*  the exploding pages incident during a press conference earlier today. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=52.08s)]
*  States did not know about nor was it involved in these incidents, and we're [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=56.52s)]
*  still gathering the information and gathering the facts. Uh, broadly [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=62.72s)]
*  speaking, we've been very clear and we remain very clear about the importance [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=67.72s)]
*  of all parties avoiding any steps that could further escalate the conflict [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=73.44s)]
*  that we're trying to resolve in Gaza to see it spread to other fronts. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=79.2s)]
*  Yes, news correspondent Chris Lifsey is following these developments for us [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  from Tel Aviv. Chris, these latest reports suggesting that walkie talkies [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=88.84s)]
*  are now detonating. We had pages yesterday, all kind of old school [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=92.92s)]
*  technology. What's the latest information you have on what's unfolding? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=96.28s)]
*  Hey, Errol. Yeah, I mean, excuse me, Hezbollah is clearly scrambling in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=101.64000000000001s)]
*  the aftermath of these attacks. You know, we were just reporting on how [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=105.64000000000001s)]
*  retaliation is is anticipated here in Israel, but Hezbollah must still [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=108.84s)]
*  be wondering if there are other devices out there, other potential [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=113.96s)]
*  security breaches that have yet to be exploited. And here we are 24 hours [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  after that last attack, and we're hearing reports of course of this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=122.28s)]
*  latest attack using walkie talkies. According to the Lebanese Ministry [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=126.24s)]
*  of Health, one person is reported killed and about 100 more have been [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=130.92s)]
*  injured. But you know, it's very early. You know, we still have to wait [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  and see exactly what the aftermath says. I mean, according to eye witnesses, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=139.84s)]
*  there are cell phone businesses that are in flames as we speak as a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=143.64s)]
*  result of the latest explosions in Lebanon. As we wait for more [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=148.83999999999997s)]
*  specifics on these latest explosions, what information are we learning [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=153.55999999999997s)]
*  about where the pages came from? Because I understand there's an [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  Asian connection, a European connection as well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=161.44s)]
*  That's right. I mean, this is absolutely a developing story. So [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  American officials and Israeli officials have pointed towards a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=170.04s)]
*  Taiwanese manufacturer. However, that manufacturer, seeking to distance [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=174.28s)]
*  itself, pointed towards a franchising, a licensing partner it uses in [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=180.6s)]
*  Hungary. However, when CBS News reached out to that company in Hungary, the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  government of Hungary said that that is merely a licensing company. It [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  does no manufacturing whatsoever. Those pagers were not made in Budapest, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=198.52s)]
*  according to those earlier reports, as they had indicated. So it's still very [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=204.68s)]
*  much a mystery as to the origins and the provenance of these exploding [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  pagers. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=215.12s)]
*  Now you're joining us from Tel Aviv. There is suspicion that perhaps Israel [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  may be behind it. They are not claiming official responsibility. But can you [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  help us understand why Israel is a kind of a prime suspect, at least? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=224.44s)]
*  Well, yes, Israel has not claimed responsibility. But the talk internally [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=229.36s)]
*  within Israel is whether or not it was the government here, the Mossad, the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  Foreign Spy Agency that carried this out, or whether or not it was another [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=243.96s)]
*  state actor. After all, Hezbollah has many enemies. But we spoke to a cyber [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=248.56s)]
*  warfare expert here in Tel Aviv who said no matter who it was, it had to be a [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  state actor in order to pull something of this grandeur off. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=259.08s)]
*  All right, Chris, let's say we'll stay connected with you throughout the day as [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=262.52s)]
*  we learn more. Thanks so much. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrcneWXjrQ&t=265.12s)]
