# What to know about Biden's upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo)
*  Let's talk about this now in his final lap before exiting the world stage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden heads to South America today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=3.36s)]
*  His first stop, Lima, Peru, where he will meet with world leaders at the Asia-Pacific [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=5.04s)]
*  Economic Cooperation Summit. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=9.4s)]
*  And next week, he'll be in Rio de Janeiro for the G20 summit. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=11.52s)]
*  Our Nancy Cordes is tracking the president's movements from the White House and joins me [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=15.4s)]
*  now to discuss. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  So Nancy, who is, what's on the agenda in terms of who the president is going to meet [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=20.96s)]
*  with and what kind of diplomatic solutions, if any, will come out of all this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=26.2s)]
*  Vlad, good to see you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=31.72s)]
*  This is sort of a swan song for the president on the world stage as he holds one last round [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=33.88s)]
*  of diplomatic conversations face to face with some of the world's most important leaders. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  First and foremost, Xi Jinping of China. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=49.28s)]
*  They're going to be sitting down one on one for the third time of Mr. Biden's presidency. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=52.16s)]
*  They last met about a year ago. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=58.68s)]
*  Those conversations are always front, but always very important because China is such [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  an important competitor, both economically and militarily. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=67.12s)]
*  But it'll also be sitting down with the leaders of Japan and Peru and Brazil and South Korea. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=72.32s)]
*  So there is a lot to discuss for a president who has always prided himself on his legacy [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=78.96s)]
*  when it comes to diplomacy and his appreciation for these major world organizations like APEC, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=86.63999999999999s)]
*  like the G20, and their ability to influence a kind of a grand scale the world's economy [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=94.6s)]
*  and major policies like climate, like trade. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=102.24s)]
*  And so he'll be spending a few days in Peru and then he'll be spending a few days in Brazil. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=109.36s)]
*  He's going to be leaving the White House any minute now to head to Joint Base Andrews for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=114.6s)]
*  that flight. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=120.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=121.0s)]
*  Nancy, let me ask you about this plan the president-elect has to enact tariffs that, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=122.0s)]
*  of course, will impact global trade. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=128.2s)]
*  Considering all that, how valuable is President Biden's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=131.64s)]
*  this weekend? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=137.76s)]
*  I mean, there's no question that he is really a lame duck here and every world leader knows [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=138.76s)]
*  it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  They all know that President-elect Trump is going to be coming into office in under 70 [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  days now, and he is going to have a very different approach than President Biden does now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  And so the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said here yesterday, President Biden [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=156.88s)]
*  isn't going to be delivering some kind of message on behalf of President Trump. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=163.12s)]
*  There's a one president at a time policy around here, but he is going to try to talk about [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=168.28s)]
*  some of the things that he thinks he can influence. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=173.24s)]
*  For example, with Xi Jinping, he sees this as a great opportunity one more time to hammer [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=176.16s)]
*  home the U.S. point of view when it comes to human rights or when it comes to China's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=182.72s)]
*  support for Russia in its invasion of Ukraine or when it comes to Taiwanese sovereignty. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=189.2s)]
*  These are messages that President Biden has delivered before and feels very comfortable [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=196.16s)]
*  with. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=201.84s)]
*  But obviously, President Xi and all these world leaders who he's going to be meeting [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=202.84s)]
*  with know that President Biden does not see eye to eye with President Trump when it comes [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=207.72s)]
*  to these global tariffs that President-elect Trump wants to impose, and they realize that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=211.28s)]
*  they're going to most likely have a very different relationship with the next president than [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=216.72s)]
*  they have with this one. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=220.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=221.88s)]
*  Nancy Cordes, always great to have you, my friend. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=222.88s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=226.04s)]
*  Are you going on that trip, Nancy? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=227.04s)]
*  Is that your assignment? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=228.04s)]
*  I would love to, Vlad. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=229.44s)]
*  But there's a lot of news here. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=230.92s)]
*  So I'm stuck right here at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=233.24s)]
*  Where you are sorely needed. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  Nancy Cordes, thank you very much. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=240.32s)]
*  Love you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=242.55999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=243.55999999999997s)]
*  Bye. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=244.55999999999997s)]
*  You too. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqo9np8ezo&t=245.55999999999997s)]
