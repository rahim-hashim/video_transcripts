# Uneasy calm settles on Moscow after deal struck between Russia, Wagner mercenary group
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA)
*  Good morning and welcome to Face the Nation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=0.0s)]
*  There is a lot we don't know yet about the motivations behind and the consequences following [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=2.84s)]
*  Wagner group leader Yevgeny Pergosian's actions in Russia this weekend. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=8.52s)]
*  What we do know about what one senior administration official calls a very bizarre episode is that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=13.5s)]
*  there seems to be a pause, at least for now, due to a truce struck between Vladimir Putin [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  and Pergosian that was brokered by the president of Belarus, a Putin ally. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  The terms of that deal are still emerging, but even after Pergosian abruptly stopped [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=29.36s)]
*  his march to Moscow yesterday, there remains trepidation about the risks ahead on this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=34.28s)]
*  unpredictable path for Russia, which holds the world's largest nuclear arsenal. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=39.6s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Ian Lee reports from Dnepro, Ukraine. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=46.0s)]
*  Rarely do failed mutineers receive a hero's departure. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=52.0s)]
*  Residents cheered Wagner soldiers as they left the Russian city of Rostov late last [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  night. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=61.76s)]
*  Come back alive and take care of yourselves, shouted people in the crowd. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=62.76s)]
*  The mercenary group's leader, Yevgeny Pergosian, smiled and posed for selfies on his way out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=67.52s)]
*  Some greeted the returning Russian authorities less warmly, with jeers and insults. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=74.8s)]
*  For 24 hours, the world watched Wagner forces inch closer to Moscow. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=80.8s)]
*  Updates of their advance splashed across social media. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  The Russian military secured the capital, soldiers deployed on the streets, and heavy [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=89.36s)]
*  equipment ripped up roads leading to the city. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=94.02000000000001s)]
*  Pergosian launched his mutiny after accusing the Russian military of killing his men in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=97.64s)]
*  Ukraine with a missile strike, a claim Russian defense officials denied. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  His men quickly seized Rostov, home of Russia's southern military headquarters, before advancing [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=107.94s)]
*  toward Moscow. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=113.4s)]
*  On Russian state TV, President Vladimir Putin accused Pergosian of treason, though he never [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=115.06s)]
*  mentioned his name and called for unity. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=120.5s)]
*  We will protect our people and country from any threats, including internal betrayal, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=124.78s)]
*  said Putin. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=129.3s)]
*  And what we're facing is precisely betrayal. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=130.38s)]
*  And with Wagner troops just 124 miles from Moscow, the Kremlin's spokesman announced [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=133.82s)]
*  a deal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=138.98000000000002s)]
*  Wagner troops would be pardoned and returned to their bases. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=140.38s)]
*  Criminal charges against Pergosian would be dropped, and he'd go into exile in Belarus, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=143.7s)]
*  whose leader brokered the agreement. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=148.54s)]
*  This morning, an uneasy calm settled on Moscow. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=151.1s)]
*  Life in Rostov also returned to normal. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=154.98s)]
*  Putin's hold on power survived, battered and bruised, but not all may be forgiven. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=157.86s)]
*  In a 2018 interview, Putin told a state TV reporter there's one thing he can never forgive. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=163.66s)]
*  Betrayal, he said. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=170.14s)]
*  Russia continued airstrikes on several cities here in Ukraine, while Kiev took advantage [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=173.02s)]
*  of the chaos to launch major assaults. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=177.38000000000002s)]
*  But it'll take time to see what effect this mutiny has on the war. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=179.74s)]
*  Margaret. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  Ian Lee in Ukraine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4G74F90xA&t=186.78s)]
