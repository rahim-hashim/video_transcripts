# Zelenskyy says he will not accept a peace deal unless Ukraine is involved in negotiations
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA)
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he will not accept any peace deal with Russia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=0.0s)]
*  unless his country is directly involved in the negotiations. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=4.64s)]
*  Zelensky stood his ground one day after President Trump spoke with him and Russian President [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=8.4s)]
*  Vladimir Putin about ending the war. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=12.620000000000001s)]
*  President Trump was asked Thursday if Ukraine would have a seat at the table. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=15.24s)]
*  We would have Ukraine, we would have Russia, and we'll have other people involved, a lot [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=18.92s)]
*  of people, a lot of forks in the, a lot of forks in this game. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=23.64s)]
*  And I'll tell you what, this is a very interesting situation, but the Ukraine war has to end. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=29.32s)]
*  CBS News Pentagon reporter Eleanor Watson joins us now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=34.6s)]
*  So Eleanor, on Wednesday, Secretary Hexett, Defense Secretary Pete Hexett, said it was [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=37.72s)]
*  unrealistic for Ukraine to join NATO and unrealistic for Ukraine to return to its pre-2014 boards [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=41.44s)]
*  before Russia took over Crimea. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=47.84s)]
*  Now Hexett is elaborating on those statements, saying the latter isn't a concession to Putin, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  trying to clarify. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  What is your understanding of the administration's positions on these issues? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=55.96s)]
*  In this administration, it often matters what one man thinks, and we heard from him today, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  President Trump, on this, when he said that Secretary Hexett's comments were probably [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=64.6s)]
*  pretty accurate. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=68.96s)]
*  Hexett said it was unrealistic to return Ukraine to its pre-2014 borders and to promise Ukraine [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=70.36s)]
*  a spot in NATO. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=77.52s)]
*  That's not that much different than what military officials during the Biden administration [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=79.28s)]
*  were saying, but those are two things, joining NATO and regaining its territory, that Ukraine [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=84.62s)]
*  would at least like to talk about. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=89.38000000000001s)]
*  So Hexett softened those comments today, saying, quote, everything is on the table. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=92.06s)]
*  He also said that nobody will get everything that they want out of these negotiations. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=96.66000000000001s)]
*  But we've yet to hear from this administration what, if anything, Russia might have to concede [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=101.02000000000001s)]
*  for starting this war. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  How were European leaders reacting to President Trump speaking with Putin? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=107.5s)]
*  The call with Putin was perhaps more alarming than what Secretary Hexett said, and that's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=112.86s)]
*  because it's still not clear whether Ukraine will have an equal seat at the table to negotiate [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=117.1s)]
*  its own future. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=122.78s)]
*  President Trump said yesterday he will soon meet with Putin, potentially in Saudi Arabia [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=124.46s)]
*  and potentially without Ukrainian President Zelensky. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=129.38s)]
*  Several European leaders said today that Europe and Ukraine need to have input in the peace [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=133.42s)]
*  talks going forward. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=140.45999999999998s)]
*  The head of the European Union Foreign Affairs team said that, quote, any deal behind our [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=141.82s)]
*  backs won't work. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=147.62s)]
*  So the initial rollout of this Ukraine peace plan is causing some fear in Europe, but it's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=149.38s)]
*  clear that the plan is still a work in progress. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=155.22s)]
*  Tomorrow, Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio may be able to provide [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=158.26s)]
*  some more details when they're at the Munich Security Conference. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=163.9s)]
*  Eleanor Watson, thank you. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnH5yr5ajWA&t=167.29999999999998s)]
