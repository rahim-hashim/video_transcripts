# Retired Gen. Frank McKenzie says U.S. has “very limited” intelligence capability in Afghanistan
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs)
*  We turn now to retired Marine General Frank McKenzie, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=0.0s)]
*  who was most recently the commander of U.S. Central Command, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  which is in charge of defending U.S. interests [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=5.32s)]
*  in the Middle East, Central, and South Asia. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=7.2s)]
*  Last August, he led the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=9.8s)]
*  and we welcome him now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=12.96s)]
*  Good morning to you, General. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=14.08s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret. It's good to be here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=17.32s)]
*  I know you were at the Pentagon when it was attacked on 9-11, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=18.8s)]
*  and as we just laid out, that really came full circle [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=22.44s)]
*  as you executed this withdrawal. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=25.92s)]
*  I wonder how you make peace and make sense of all that was lost, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=28.24s)]
*  not just the 2,400 service people who lost their lives in that conflict, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=34.32s)]
*  but those who survived, who continued to deal with loss [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=39.96s)]
*  and look at an Afghanistan that is once again under the control of the Taliban. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=43.12s)]
*  Well, Margaret, over the 21-year arc from 9-11, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=51.32s)]
*  and I was in the Pentagon when we came out of Afghanistan last August, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=54.56s)]
*  we prevented a major attack from occurring on the United States. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=58.36s)]
*  The cost was not cheap, as you noted. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=62.52s)]
*  We lost a lot of brave young Americans. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=64.84s)]
*  Our coalition partners lost a lot of their soldiers, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=67.4s)]
*  and of course, the Afghan people paid a steep price for that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=70.72s)]
*  So it wasn't a cost-free proposition, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=73.0s)]
*  but we did manage to prevent another major attack [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=75.88s)]
*  from occurring against the United States during that period of time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=78.28s)]
*  I'm still processing what it means here at the end, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  and it would be presumptuous of me to say that it bothers me more [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=84.48s)]
*  than those who lost a loved one at some time in Afghanistan [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  or one of the other theaters where we carried on this battle [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  against a relentless violent foe. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=94.48s)]
*  I know you have, since leaving, your position shared [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=98.0s)]
*  that you advised President Biden not to draw down to zero, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=102.56s)]
*  to leave a residual force of 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=106.56s)]
*  It's the right of the commander-in-chief to keep his own counsel [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  and reject the advice of his military commanders. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=114.0s)]
*  If you felt so strongly, why didn't you resign? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=116.56s)]
*  I had the opportunity to give advice to the president. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=122.36s)]
*  He heard my advice. It was heard thoughtfully. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=125.76s)]
*  And that's really all a commander should expect to be able to do under our system. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=128.12s)]
*  Once the president makes a decision, and for a combatant commander like me, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  the chain of command is very short. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=136.48s)]
*  It is the secretary of defense, and it is the president of the United States. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=138.4s)]
*  And once civilian leadership makes a decision, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=141.92s)]
*  even though I might disagree with that decision, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  it is my moral responsibility to execute that order. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  To resign is not in the history. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=150.56s)]
*  It is not something that U.S. officers have typically done. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=154.2s)]
*  And it sends a very bad signal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=157.44s)]
*  It is a political act by an officer who must need and must be and remain apolitical. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  So even if you disagree with the order, as long as the order is legal, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=165.44s)]
*  you need to follow that order. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=169.0s)]
*  If we do anything different, it would be very dangerous to the republic. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=170.48s)]
*  So while I gave advice, my advice was not followed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=173.76s)]
*  I executed that order as well as we were able to do. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=177.6s)]
*  And I'll just note that the president makes decisions based on many factors. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=180.04s)]
*  My recommendation, the Central Command AOR, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=183.68s)]
*  certainly one of the factors he had to weigh. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  There were other factors that the president had to weigh as well. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=187.96s)]
*  And I'm very much aware of that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=190.52s)]
*  Well, do you think, given your assessment of the threat, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=192.68s)]
*  that the United States is paying enough attention now to the Middle East and to Afghanistan? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=198.04s)]
*  Well, I hope that we are. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=205.72s)]
*  I think that we have very, very limited ability to see into Afghanistan right now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=207.88s)]
*  I've said I think we've got certainly less than two or three percent of the intelligence [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=213.48s)]
*  capability that we had before we withdrew. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=217.44s)]
*  Our interest in Afghanistan is preventing al-Qaeda or ISIS from regenerating [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=220.6s)]
*  and being able to conduct an attack on our homeland or the homelands of our friends and partners. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  And our ability to do that has certainly been gravely reduced. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=230.92s)]
*  Now, the fact that we took a strike against Zawahiri, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  and that was a very good and proper action, that's good news. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=237.16s)]
*  I would note that's one strike in a year. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=241.6s)]
*  And I'll just come back. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  I would be careful about drawing conclusions about our ability to operate effectively in Afghanistan [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=244.92s)]
*  in a counterterrorism sense based on that single operation. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=250.84s)]
*  You're talking about the CIA drone strike that took out the leader of al-Qaeda, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=254.08s)]
*  Eamon al-Zawahiri, in July. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  But the administration would point to that and say, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=262.52000000000004s)]
*  look, we can counter the terror threat without a military footprint. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  So are we at the right balance right now of keeping the homeland safe? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=271.48s)]
*  Do you agree with their assessment that ISIS and al-Qaeda do not presently [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=277.24s)]
*  pose a threat of being able to carry out an attack here? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=283.2s)]
*  When I left active duty, it was our assessment that if we left Afghanistan, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  if the Afghan government fell, if the Taliban took over, then over a period of time, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=295.44s)]
*  both al-Qaeda and ISIS would be able to regenerate. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=299.64s)]
*  That is still my opinion today. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=303.36s)]
*  It's going to take a little time for them to do that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=305.24s)]
*  But I think what's most concerning about the CIA strike that you mentioned was the fact [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=307.96s)]
*  that he was living in very good accommodations in downtown Kabul. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=312.12s)]
*  And that should give us all pause and also speak directly to the ill intent of the Taliban [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=315.56s)]
*  in negotiating with us as we worked with the Doha agreement, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=321.16s)]
*  which was the attempt to find an end to the war in Afghanistan. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=324.6s)]
*  I think it's a manifest example of their of their inability to keep their word. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=327.56s)]
*  What I hear you saying there is that the Trump administration bears responsibility [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=332.92s)]
*  for the deal it brokered with the Taliban, the Doha agreement. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=337.64s)]
*  So I think the reason that we left Afghanistan and the reason the Afghan government fell [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=342.92s)]
*  was that two presidents, President Trump and President Biden, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=347.68s)]
*  both had as a very high objective to leave Afghanistan. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=350.36s)]
*  So you had continuity of purpose across two administrations. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=353.4s)]
*  Now, the Doha agreement, had we had we held the Taliban to the conditionality [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=357.44s)]
*  that was a critical part of it, it could have been a useful vehicle for moving forward. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=362.64s)]
*  But we did not hold the Taliban to the conditions that they said they would observe. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=366.64s)]
*  And that's that because of that, no agreement is going to be good. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=371.12s)]
*  The Biden administration has not released any public version of an after action report of what went wrong. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=375.68s)]
*  This was a big black eye. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=382.44s)]
*  I don't have to tell you that how this withdrawal happened. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=384.16s)]
*  Do you think this assessment should be made public? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=388.16s)]
*  And does the fact it is not public now suggest to you that any politics is at play? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=392.08s)]
*  I don't know, Margaret. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=397.08s)]
*  I would tell you that I participated before I left active duty in that after action review. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=401.24s)]
*  We did a number of those inside CENTCOM and then I was also interviewed several times [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=406.03999999999996s)]
*  for the review that I believe is still working within inside the Department of Defense. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=411.4s)]
*  I think it's probably a good thing to release as much of that review as you can. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=415.2s)]
*  Obviously, there are going to be there are going to be sensitive intelligence components to that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=418.59999999999997s)]
*  And but I think you could probably excise some of those and still I think the American people [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=422.32s)]
*  want to know what happened and I think it's a reasonable thing to do. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=426.92s)]
*  We will continue to press for that and thank you for your insights today. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnL68OScYMs&t=430.2s)]
