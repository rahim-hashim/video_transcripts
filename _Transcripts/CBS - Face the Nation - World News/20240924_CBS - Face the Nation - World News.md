# NATO chief urges allies to decide on Ukraine long-range missile usage
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. In his final speech to the United Nations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=0.0s)]
*  General Assembly, President Biden said he sees the world's challenges but has [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=4.0s)]
*  hope there's a way forward. He also emphasized his support for Ukraine and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=8.08s)]
*  its war against Russia. The good news is Putin's war has failed and his at his [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=12.0s)]
*  core aim. He set out to destroy Ukraine but Ukraine is still free. He set out the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=20.0s)]
*  weak in NATO but NATO is bigger stronger more united than ever before. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=26.36s)]
*  Weijia Jiang joins us now from the United Nations in New York and Weijia we know [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=31.6s)]
*  you spoke with the NATO Secretary General about a range of issues today [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=35.6s)]
*  including the war in Ukraine. What do we have to tell you? Yes we did Scott and we [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=39.16s)]
*  spoke to him shortly after President Biden delivered his remarks which [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=46.16s)]
*  really was an effort for the president to cement his legacy on foreign policy [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=50.4s)]
*  and not only did Biden speak about Ukraine but he also touched on all the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=55.56s)]
*  things that the administration has done under his leadership investing in climate [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  change and trying to broker a ceasefire in Gaza but with regard to Ukraine which [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=65.64s)]
*  of course is the the secretary general's main concern here he did talk about [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=70.88s)]
*  Biden's leadership in this effort and what he's looking for in the next few [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  days especially as President Zelensky makes a speech before this group. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=82.84s)]
*  President Zelensky has been very clear about what he believes could help him [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  win and that is the use of long-range missiles into Russia. Of course you know [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=94.64000000000001s)]
*  what Putin has said about that he said if the West allows that to happen then [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=100.92000000000002s)]
*  that would mean the West is now in the war with Russia but you recently called [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  his bluff on this because you said we've heard these sorts of things from [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=110.6s)]
*  Putin before so do you not take his words at face value here? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=114.52s)]
*  He has threatened us again and again since the start of this war when we [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=121.08s)]
*  delivered advanced artillery advanced the battle tanks fighter jets and now it [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  threatened us again and he tries to coerce us from supporting Ukraine. We [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=131.95999999999998s)]
*  need to remember this is this is a war of aggression Russia attacked another [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=137.16s)]
*  country that's a blatant violation of international law according to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=140.56s)]
*  international law Ukraine has the right to self-defense and that includes also [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=145.2s)]
*  the right to strike legitimate military targets on the territory of the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=149.44s)]
*  aggression Russia. Some allies have no restrictions on the use of their weapons [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=153.4s)]
*  others have imposed some kind of restrictions but also those allies have [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=158.76s)]
*  actually loosened their restrictions over the last months I welcome that and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=166.36s)]
*  also welcome that we have an ongoing conversation consultations on this issue [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  in in NATO. But from your view do you believe that Ukraine should be able to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  use these long-range missiles? I believe that what you have seen so far that some [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=181.68s)]
*  allies have loosened their restrictions is the right way to go and I welcome [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=186.4s)]
*  that we continue to work on these issues. The problem the challenge is that in a [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=191.08s)]
*  war there are no risks with options but I strongly believe that the biggest risk [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=195.18s)]
*  will be if President Putin wins because that will send a message to him that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=199.38s)]
*  when he used military force he gets what he wants and that's also not only a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=203.58s)]
*  challenge for Europe but also something we will see in Asia because the war in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine is followed closely in Beijing so as the Japanese Prime Minister actually [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=212.86s)]
*  told me yesterday in a meeting what happens in Ukraine today can happen in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=217.46s)]
*  Asia tomorrow so this is about standing up for international law and prevent [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=221.58s)]
*  authoritarian regimes from believing that they can get what they want by using [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=229.22000000000003s)]
*  military force. We have seen President Biden be convinced on the Abrams tanks [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=232.38000000000002s)]
*  on the fighter jets and change his position will you try to convince [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=239.58s)]
*  President Biden to change his stance on these long-range missiles? Well as I said [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=245.58s)]
*  this is part of ongoing conversation among NATO allies and also the United [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=250.46s)]
*  States has loosened its restrictions because not so many months ago Russia [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  opened the total new front and until then most of the fighting in Ukraine had [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=261.1s)]
*  taken place deep inside Ukrainian territory but when the Russians opened [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=266.06s)]
*  the front in the Kharkiv region the front line and the border line was more or less [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=270.14s)]
*  the same and of course then it doesn't give any meaning to say that you're not [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  fire behind the front lines and then the United States loosened up the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=277.42s)]
*  restrictions on use of their weapons and I think it's absolute value in now [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=284.22s)]
*  seeing if there are so the potential loosening up even more but again I think [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=287.98s)]
*  these conversations should take place among allies that's the best I would [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=293.42s)]
*  rest in these issues. Of course a parallel conversation is whether Ukraine [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  will ever be able to join NATO. What do you say to that? Well Ukraine should and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=304.82s)]
*  must join NATO they have made declared they would like to join NATO, NATO also [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=310.86s)]
*  made it clear that they should become a member so what we are discussing is not [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=316.86s)]
*  if but when and I think we need to understand that at some stage this war [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=320.74s)]
*  has to end and when the war ends we need to be sure that this is really the end. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=326.86s)]
*  Of course there is another conflict going on in Gaza and NATO does not have [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=331.5s)]
*  a unanimous agreement the countries about the approach so how would you [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=338.26s)]
*  describe NATO's view on you know how to end that war and whether a united front [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=343.94s)]
*  is necessary? So we are deeply concerned about escalation the suffering and of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=351.1s)]
*  course that's also reason why I welcome that United States and other allies [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=360.14s)]
*  United States Qatar Egypt have now taken initiatives or are working hard to try [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=364.3s)]
*  to find a peaceful way forward to deescalate to have the release of the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=371.02s)]
*  hostages but also of course the ceasefire. NATO is the answer to many [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=377.06s)]
*  problems in the world but NATO is not the answer to every problem. And that is [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=382.46s)]
*  the message that President Biden sent as well Scott that now is the time to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=388.76s)]
*  finalize that ceasefire agreement and one other note President Biden even [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=393.68s)]
*  though this is not a political speech did get a bit nostalgic and he had a [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=399.24s)]
*  message to foreign leaders he said that some things are more important than [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=403.64s)]
*  staying in power and it's the people who matter the most that of course is [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=408.4s)]
*  significant given the fact that he stepped down from the top of the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=413.08s)]
*  Democratic presidential ticket paving the way for Vice President Harris. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=418.72s)]
*  Busy day the UN in New York. Weijia Jiang thank you very much. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpl5R5fyUk&t=423.04s)]
