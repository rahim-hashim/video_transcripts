# French Prime Minister Michel Barnier submits resignation after parliament's no confidence vote
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A)
*  All right, French Prime Minister Michel Barnier [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=0.0s)]
*  submitted his resignation this morning [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=2.06s)]
*  after a historic no-confidence vote [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=3.7s)]
*  was passed yesterday in Parliament. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=5.34s)]
*  It is the first no-confidence vote [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=6.96s)]
*  for a French politician since 1962. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=8.74s)]
*  Barnier will have served the shortest term [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=11.58s)]
*  by any prime minister in the country's history. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=13.38s)]
*  I wanna bring in BBC Europe correspondent Mark Lowen [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=15.92s)]
*  to join me now to talk more a little bit about this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=19.02s)]
*  So Mark, just explain to our audience [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=22.32s)]
*  here in the United States the role of the prime minister [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=24.28s)]
*  and why things went pear-shaped. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=28.58s)]
*  Hi there, Vlad. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=33.58s)]
*  Well, the prime minister runs the government here [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=34.42s)]
*  on a day-to-day basis [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=37.06s)]
*  and is in charge of domestic affairs, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=38.22s)]
*  while the president is more in charge of foreign affairs. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=39.96s)]
*  So President Macron is a kind of a leader on the world stage, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=42.72s)]
*  but the prime minister is hugely important. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=46.84s)]
*  And as you say, this is an unprecedented times here in France, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=49.34s)]
*  not for more than 60 years [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=54.0s)]
*  has a prime minister been ousted by parliament, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=55.379999999999995s)]
*  but that is what happened to Michel Barnier. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=57.42s)]
*  Now I'm standing outside the presidential palace here, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=59.66s)]
*  the Elys√©e Palace, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=61.46s)]
*  and President Macron has accepted [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=62.76s)]
*  the prime minister's resignation, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=65.24s)]
*  and he is going to go on national TV tonight, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=67.0s)]
*  8 p.m. French time, to make a statement. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=69.74s)]
*  Now we don't know if he will name immediately [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=73.0s)]
*  as somebody who he wants to be the successor, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=75.3s)]
*  the new prime minister, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=77.88s)]
*  or whether he says he will take his time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=78.98s)]
*  But either way, time is of the essence [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=81.22s)]
*  because France is now in political turmoil. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=84.08s)]
*  And we have economic instability as well [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  with very high budget deficit and public debt. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=90.14s)]
*  And of course, it is a really delicate time for Europe [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=94.72s)]
*  with wars on its borders. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=97.02s)]
*  And where you are, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=98.82s)]
*  Donald Trump about to take office in the White House, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=100.22s)]
*  and so Europe needing kind of unity and stability [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=102.06s)]
*  to be able to step up to the plate [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=105.62s)]
*  and potentially act as a counterbalance [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=107.16s)]
*  to a Trump presidency. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=108.66s)]
*  So, you know, this is, I think, again, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=110.36s)]
*  for a lot of people who are watching this here, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=112.16s)]
*  Mark, why was Barnier prime minister in the first place? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  And I think it's oftentimes [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  because people don't have a firm grasp [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  of how parliamentary politics work, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=121.94000000000001s)]
*  because we have a very different system, obviously, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=123.7s)]
*  here in the United States. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=125.5s)]
*  But why would Barnier be chosen as PM [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=126.98s)]
*  if he was going to face a no-confidence vote so soon [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=130.6s)]
*  after rising to that post? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=133.94s)]
*  That's certainly a question that people will be asking [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=138.58s)]
*  of President Macron, who appointed him three months ago, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=140.54000000000002s)]
*  Vlad. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=143.06s)]
*  What happened was that there were snap parliamentary [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=143.9s)]
*  elections that the president called last summer, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=146.98000000000002s)]
*  summer this year, early elections. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=150.18s)]
*  He didn't need to call them when he did, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=152.26000000000002s)]
*  but he wanted to catch the far right on the back foot, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=154.22s)]
*  as he hoped. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=158.38s)]
*  That didn't really happen. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=159.46s)]
*  It led to a hung parliament here, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  which means that no grouping in the French parliament [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=162.66000000000003s)]
*  had a majority. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  So that is then up to the president to name a prime minister. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=167.18s)]
*  And rather than name a candidate from the left, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=171.34s)]
*  which was the largest block out of that election, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=174.1s)]
*  it didn't get a majority, but it came out on top. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=176.86s)]
*  President Macron said, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=180.14000000000001s)]
*  no, a left-wing candidate would not get a majority [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=180.98000000000002s)]
*  in parliament, so he chose Michel Barnier [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=183.22s)]
*  from the center right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=185.38s)]
*  And that was a kind of, you know, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=187.12s)]
*  Barnier was cursed from the very beginning, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=189.38s)]
*  because coming from the center right, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=191.02s)]
*  that was always going to be, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=193.14000000000001s)]
*  prompt a furious reaction, sorry, noisy, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=194.78s)]
*  noisy times here on the left. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=196.86s)]
*  And the left was never going to support Barnier. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=199.5s)]
*  So Barnier tried to cobble together this coalition [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=202.58s)]
*  and push through a budget, an austerity budget, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=204.9s)]
*  pension cuts and tax rises. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=207.78s)]
*  And that didn't get the support of left and right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=211.58s)]
*  And so they pushed through a no confidence motion, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=214.18s)]
*  which toppled Michel Barnier. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=217.38s)]
*  So now the question is, will there be any other candidate [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=218.98s)]
*  who actually could create a unity [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=222.1s)]
*  in this very fragmented divided parliament? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=224.32s)]
*  Mark Lowen with an excellent, excellent primer [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=227.32s)]
*  on politics in La Republique Francaise. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=230.48s)]
*  Mark, appreciate it as always, my friend. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=232.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZhsSOXH70A&t=234.76s)]
