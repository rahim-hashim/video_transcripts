# UNICEF chief says Gaza crisis is "the most challenging environment for us"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA)
*  We turn now to the executive director of the UN agency that helps disadvantaged children in the world's toughest places [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=0.0s)]
*  UNICEF's Katherine Russell joins us from New York good to speak with you again [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=6.88s)]
*  I know you're just back from Sudan, which is the largest humanitarian crisis on the planet right now [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=11.0s)]
*  What did you learn? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=18.3s)]
*  Yeah, I learned that it is a catastrophic situation for children there and there are compounding crises first [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=21.72s)]
*  It's the largest displacement crisis for children around the world [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  So many millions of children have moved either from their homes to neighboring countries like South Sudan [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  Egypt or Chad many millions are moved inside [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=36.68s)]
*  Sudan to other places in the city trying to earn in the country trying to find some refuge [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=40.92s)]
*  It's also a huge challenge in terms of malnutrition. We have four million children who are severely malnourished [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=45.56s)]
*  Almost more than half a million of those children are severely acutely malnourished [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=52.4s)]
*  Which means that they really are on the verge of starvation and then shockingly almost every child in Sudan has been out of school [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=56.64s)]
*  For the last year, which is incredibly destabilizing for them for their future and certainly for the country as well [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=64.2s)]
*  Yeah, 17 million children who are not in school [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=70.84s)]
*  shocking [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=75.08s)]
*  Apart from the humanitarian concern here [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=76.36s)]
*  I know the US intelligence community has highlighted that Sudan could become a terrorist safe haven due to this ongoing civil war [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=78.6s)]
*  What are the conditions like for those next generations? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  The conditions are absolutely terrible [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=92.6s)]
*  I have to say I was at a center that UNICEF supports where we were providing all sorts of services for children [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=94.6s)]
*  Education which you know is as as we discussed a horrific problem for them not being in school [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=101.35999999999999s)]
*  Trying to provide health care providing psychosocial support for children who are so traumatized. It's just almost hard to imagine [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  It's also it's just such a desperate place in so many ways. They're so [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  You know [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=118.28s)]
*  They've been so traumatized by so much violence and they've seen things that no child should ever see and that's really something that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=118.88s)]
*  Long-term is hard to imagine how they get over it having said that we are there. We're working hard [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=125.96s)]
*  We are getting to these children [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=130.88s)]
*  But this ongoing conflict makes it almost impossible to provide a decent future for these kids a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=132.44s)]
*  Little closer to home in Haiti [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=139.28s)]
*  I know this past week the first UN backed foreign law enforcement forces from eight different countries [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  Arrived this is part of a US supported effort. How quickly do you think that will make a difference for the children there? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=148.44s)]
*  Well, I will say [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=157.76s)]
*  Hopefully it will be quick because the children there [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=159.68s)]
*  I mean honestly, I feel like I was sort of a broken record when I tell you how bad it is in so many places [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=162.0s)]
*  But Haiti is really challenging because there's so much violence [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=166.56s)]
*  I was shocked by what I saw when I was there several months ago [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=170.96s)]
*  So many children who have seen violence directly who have experienced violence high high rates of sexual violence [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  So it's been incredibly important to try to stabilize that situation. I think this is the first step [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  It's gonna take a lot of work I think to get it done [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  But at least we'll start to see some semblance hopefully of some security which will make it easier for us to operate [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  But also give these children some prospect for a decent future that isn't defined by violence and hunger [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=194.16s)]
*  Which is unfortunately what we're seeing now [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  And the US remains the largest donor to many of these humanitarian causes [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  I know there was one rare piece of good news this past week in the Middle East [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=208.64s)]
*  I read 21 children with cancer were permitted to be medically evacuated from Gaza. This was the first evacuation since May [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=214.48s)]
*  Why is it so hard to get sick children out? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=223.44s)]
*  I'll say this, you know, everything in Gaza is hard. It's just the most challenging environment for us to work in [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  I have to say I think that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=237.0s)]
*  You know that the main problem is a lack of security and that makes it difficult for the children who live there [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=239.0s)]
*  They've been displaced so many times so many children have multiple times moved trying to seek refuge trying to get away from the bombardments [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=245.44s)]
*  I think it's it's incredibly challenging [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=253.32s)]
*  We know we continue to see that we're on the verge of famine there [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=255.72s)]
*  So children they basically that just means they don't really know where their next meal is coming from [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=258.84s)]
*  They also have not been in school, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=262.88s)]
*  So it's an incredibly challenging place for children and I think you know [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=265.64000000000004s)]
*  It is great to find some shred of shred of good news [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=269.32000000000005s)]
*  And you know when you think about it you forget in these humanitarian situations [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=272.48s)]
*  The humanitarian crisis is so devastating that you forget that there are routine problems that children face, right? They're not getting their vaccines [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=276.16s)]
*  They're not getting treatment for things like cancer or other other sort of routine [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=282.76000000000005s)]
*  diseases and challenges that children all over the world face [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=287.88s)]
*  So getting some of these kids out of there has been as you say a bright spot [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=290.5s)]
*  But I think overall we continue to see real challenges in our ability to operate there [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=294.74s)]
*  We need to get that situation sorted out so that children have some prospect [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=299.58000000000004s)]
*  And I think this applies to all three of the situations you've talked about [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  Children are the future we talk about that all the time [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=307.22s)]
*  But what does that mean if we don't give them a future if we don't make sure that they have some some prospect of hope [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=309.70000000000005s)]
*  And I think it's incumbent upon all of the adults in the world to come together [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=316.1s)]
*  And to do better by these children. I couldn't agree more with you on that director Russell. Thank you very much [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu-F1XlzsA&t=320.42s)]
