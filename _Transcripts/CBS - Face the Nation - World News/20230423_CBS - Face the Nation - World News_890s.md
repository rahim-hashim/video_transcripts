# Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on "Face the Nation" | full interview
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw)
*  We turn now to Israel, where tens of thousands of protesters marched through Tel Aviv last [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=0.0s)]
*  night in opposition to the government's plans to overhaul the judicial system. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=5.88s)]
*  This is just days ahead of Israel's 75th anniversary, celebrating its independence. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=10.94s)]
*  For more, we go now to the country's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=16.84s)]
*  Good morning to you, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  It has been— [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=24.76s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=25.76s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=26.76s)]
*  Well, we're glad you are here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=27.76s)]
*  You know, it has been a month since you hit pause on those judicial reforms. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  At this moment in time, when you need national unity, why not withdraw them? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, I think there's a broad consensus that we have to make corrections in our judicial [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=39.36s)]
*  system. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  There's obviously a dramatic difference between the views of how, to what extent, and so on. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  But I think this should not cloud the fact that we're celebrating here a modern miracle. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=52.3s)]
*  Israel's 75th anniversary is the change that happened to the Jewish people who were decimated [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  in the Holocaust. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=62.36s)]
*  A third of our people were lost to this independent nation that has become a power in the world. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=63.36s)]
*  And I think everybody unites around that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  The fact that we have demonstrations, I think that's a sign of our democracy. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=70.8s)]
*  Just as you have demonstrations in France, you have demonstrations in the United States, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=74.36s)]
*  I don't think anybody should have any doubts that Israel is and will remain a vibrant democracy, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=78.36s)]
*  boisterous and vibrant. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=85.08s)]
*  Certainly boisterous because you had to cancel a Monday appearance at the largest gathering [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=87.36s)]
*  of North American Jewish leaders in years because of these protest concerns. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=91.72s)]
*  Again, why not withdraw the proposal to overhaul the judicial system, which would give Parliament, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=96.56s)]
*  which is controlled by your allies, authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=102.84s)]
*  Well, I've actually said that I will not accept a blanket ability of the Parliament [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  to overcome judicial Supreme Court decisions, just as we don't accept that the Supreme [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=113.4s)]
*  Court can abrogate any decision by the Parliament or the government. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=118.32s)]
*  Both sides, both of these extremes actually hinder the balance between the three branches [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=122.24s)]
*  of government, which is exactly what we're trying to bring into balance now. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=128.76s)]
*  Now, I did say this, and I acted upon it as prime minister. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=133.44s)]
*  I said, all right, let's take time out and let's try to see how we can balance the two [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=136.48s)]
*  opposing sides. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=141.72s)]
*  One says, you know, we don't have democracy because we don't have majority rule, because [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=142.88000000000002s)]
*  we elect with a majority of Parliament and a government and executive, and then they're [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  overturned. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=152.52s)]
*  Every decision can be overturned by the Supreme Court. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=153.52s)]
*  And on the other side, people say, well, OK, if you protect the rights of the majority, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=155.82000000000002s)]
*  you might be hindering the rights of the minority or individual rights by having the Parliament [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=160.0s)]
*  overrule the Supreme Court. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  There is, I think, a difficult and happy middle. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  Sir, you're making this sound like it's just a debate. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=167.32000000000002s)]
*  You're making it sound like this is just a simple debate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=170.36s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=172.36s)]
*  Like any other country. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=173.36s)]
*  But you yourself use the phrase that you are pausing because you wanted to stop the possibility [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=174.36s)]
*  of civil war. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  That was a phrase you use when you hit pause. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=180.8s)]
*  I want to I want to just lay out for you here what it has done here in the United States. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=182.68s)]
*  Those judicial plans led President Biden to say he won't be inviting you to Washington [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=190.8s)]
*  any time soon. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=195.84s)]
*  Listen. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=197.24s)]
*  I'm very concerned. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=198.24s)]
*  And I'm concerned that they get this straight. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=200.36s)]
*  They cannot continue down this road. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  Hopefully, the prime minister will act in a way that he can try to work out some genuine [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  compromise. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=211.56s)]
*  Biden told you to walk away. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=214.28s)]
*  You seem to be betting that there won't be consequences to alienating your closest ally. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=215.8s)]
*  Well, I value the alliance with the United States and I value the friendship I've had [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=220.24s)]
*  over 40 years with President Biden. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=225.0s)]
*  I don't think anything will get in that way. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  But it's an internal matter that we have to resolve. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=229.34s)]
*  And we're doing it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  And the way we're doing it is by seeking a consensus as we speak right now, Margaret, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=234.12s)]
*  as we speak right now, there are teams of my own party, the Likud and the coalition, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=238.86s)]
*  with teams from the opposition speaking in the president's house. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=244.54000000000002s)]
*  This is now the fifth or sixth meeting they've had seeking that compromise that I think is [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=247.94s)]
*  the mark of democracies. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=253.34s)]
*  You don't walk away from a problem. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=254.8s)]
*  You try to solve it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=256.62s)]
*  No, walk away from your proposal. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=257.74s)]
*  Through as broad a consensus as you can. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=259.22s)]
*  Walk away from your proposal, which would allow parliament with a simple majority to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=261.18s)]
*  override any decision by the Supreme Court. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=265.18s)]
*  That is your one check and balance on power, very different from the American system. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=268.46s)]
*  I've already—you're absolutely right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=272.42s)]
*  And there are things in the American system that are very different from what is proposed [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  here. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=277.38s)]
*  For example, only elected officials in the United States choose Supreme Court justices [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=278.38s)]
*  in here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  They're saying, that can't be, there won't be a democracy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, America's a democracy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=285.26s)]
*  So, actually, I've said that I don't want a blanket overrule of the Knesset over the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=286.82s)]
*  Supreme Court, and I stand by that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=293.78s)]
*  And in fact, it's not going to happen. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=295.7s)]
*  So we have a way to go. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=297.17999999999995s)]
*  I think that what has changed is this—and you won't hear about it, because there is [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=299.05999999999995s)]
*  a lot of tangentialist reporting, to say the least. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=302.41999999999996s)]
*  But I think right now, in the three months since the establishment of my government, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=305.94s)]
*  there has been a majority that now believe that we need to have judicial reform. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=310.02s)]
*  I think there is recognition on both sides right now that the extreme positions of keeping [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=316.14000000000004s)]
*  what we have exactly as it is is unacceptable. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=320.86s)]
*  And people on my side of the aisle would believe that the original proposal is not going to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  happen either. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=328.98s)]
*  There is a middle way, and I'm going to do my damnedest to find it, because I think [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=329.98s)]
*  it's the right thing to do for the country. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=334.3s)]
*  We will track it then. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=335.82000000000005s)]
*  I want to ask you about the makeup of your government, because it is impacting U.S. relations. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=336.82000000000005s)]
*  Your finance minister calls himself a homophobe. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=341.54s)]
*  He said a Palestinian village should be erased. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=345.68s)]
*  You did say that was inappropriate. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  Your public security minister was rejected from Army service because of past ties to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=350.4s)]
*  an extremist group designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=356.08s)]
*  I know you need to keep your coalition together to prevent a collapse, but are you confident [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=361.08s)]
*  you can rein in people like this? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  I think a lot of them have changed over time, and they themselves say that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=370.8s)]
*  The important thing to understand is they joined me. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=375.08s)]
*  I didn't join them. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  We have by far the largest party in the Knesset and certainly in the coalition. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=378.32s)]
*  There are smaller parties. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  The mainstream policies are decided by me, and that's what I'm doing. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=384.76s)]
*  By the way, that's true of the main things that are important for our country, continuing [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=388.64s)]
*  our free market economy, pursuing peace through strength and peace through responsibility, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=393.52s)]
*  applying strength responsibly. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=398.84s)]
*  Doesn't this complicate your plans to— [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=399.84s)]
*  Doesn't this complicate your plans to— [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  A lot of people said about me over the years that I will be— [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  To make peace, though. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  I just want to say— [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=406.35999999999996s)]
*  Doesn't this complicate your plans to make peace with the Arab world? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  Does this complicate my what? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=412.35999999999996s)]
*  Having individuals like this— [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=414.96s)]
*  You repeat that? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=415.96s)]
*  You've said that—you just said right now that you are firmly in control, but having [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=416.96s)]
*  individuals like this with this kind of track record, doesn't this complicate your broader [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=421.35999999999996s)]
*  goals, as you just said, of broader peace in the region? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=425.64s)]
*  No. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=429.71999999999997s)]
*  Look, as the prime minister of Israel, I see—you know, everybody sees things above the surface. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  They don't see things below the surface. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=434.52s)]
*  And the prime minister of Israel sees a lot of things below the surface. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=436.64s)]
*  And I'm telling you now, something that I said 10 years ago in the U.N., I said, look, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=440.21999999999997s)]
*  we're going to move into things you haven't seen in my lifetime, and that is Arab states [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=444.84s)]
*  will recognize that Israel is not their enemy, but their friend, even an indispensable friend, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=450.03999999999996s)]
*  and we're going to have peace treaties. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  And people poo-pooed it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=456.14s)]
*  And it's happened. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=457.52s)]
*  I've had four historic peace agreements with Arab states. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=458.76s)]
*  I'm telling you now, with this coalition, things that I see under the surface that we [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  are going to have, because of this view, this interest that Arab countries have to partner [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=466.03999999999996s)]
*  with Israel, I think you're going to be surprised, and maybe sooner than you think. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=473.0s)]
*  Well, this national security minister I just mentioned, Ben Gavir, who threatened to quit, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=477.35999999999996s)]
*  which would have collapsed your government, you promised him a national guard would be [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=484.12s)]
*  established under his control. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=488.04s)]
*  The IDF and your security forces are more than strong. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=490.0s)]
*  He's already gone out and said he wants police to remove Palestinian flags from public spaces. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=495.0s)]
*  What exactly do you think he's going to do with this national guard? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=501.0s)]
*  Well, the national guard is not merely his idea. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=504.20000000000005s)]
*  It's a wide proposal, which is, by the way, recognized, was actually proposed by the previous [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  because you need, Israel has a small police force relative to the size of the population. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=513.08s)]
*  And we face, unlike other police forces around the world, we face a constant threat of terror. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=519.76s)]
*  So you need an additional body. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=524.5200000000001s)]
*  This is the same man who called for a Palestinian village to be erased. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=525.5200000000001s)]
*  It's not actually. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=530.4000000000001s)]
*  It's a different person, but that person already apologized and said that his statements [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=531.4000000000001s)]
*  were taken out of context. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=535.6s)]
*  The question you asked, there is a national guard. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=536.76s)]
*  It's going to be under one of our national security under one of our security arms. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=539.04s)]
*  It's not going to be any individual persons or ministers militia. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=544.04s)]
*  That's not going to happen in Israel. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=548.28s)]
*  Not under me. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=549.8s)]
*  And I suspect none under one else. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=550.8s)]
*  It's just not going to happen. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=553.16s)]
*  Can you clarify this for us as well, because it's making headlines in the U.S. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  Politician Meg Olaan said that you are considering appointing her to be Consul General in New [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=558.56s)]
*  York. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=563.8s)]
*  She calls herself a proud racist. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=564.8s)]
*  She's denounced African refugees as Muslim infiltrators and criminals spreading HIV. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=566.6s)]
*  Are you nominating her to actually serve in New York, an incredibly important post for [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=572.44s)]
*  Israel? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=577.12s)]
*  It is indeed an incredibly important post and anyone I'll nominate and I haven't done [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=578.12s)]
*  so will have to abide and will abide by the mainstream positions that I've advocated. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=582.44s)]
*  And I welcome the fact that the United States has a multiracial and pluralistic society. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=588.0s)]
*  So does Israel. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=596.48s)]
*  And anyone I appoint will have to reflect the value that I attach to that quality in [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=597.7600000000001s)]
*  our democracy and in yours. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=606.1600000000001s)]
*  So you are not appointing her? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=607.8800000000001s)]
*  I haven't. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=609.44s)]
*  But I'm telling you that anyone that I will appoint will abide stringently by that view [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=610.5s)]
*  that I've advocated throughout my lifetime. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=616.96s)]
*  And it's not pro forma. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=619.48s)]
*  It's not lip service. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=620.48s)]
*  I really believe that. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=621.48s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=623.48s)]
*  Sounds like you're saying she's not coming to New York. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=624.52s)]
*  I want to ask you about some of the Americans coming to Israel. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=628.0s)]
*  Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis is visiting Israel this week and he's presumed to be running [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=630.88s)]
*  for president here, as you know. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=635.04s)]
*  You've endorsed Republicans in the past. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=637.08s)]
*  Do you plan to meet with him? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=639.84s)]
*  What do you think of him? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=641.52s)]
*  I've never endorsed any candidate for any job in America. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=644.64s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=649.88s)]
*  You were very supportive of Mitt Romney. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=650.88s)]
*  And I've checked this record. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=652.28s)]
*  Now I met equally with President Obama when he was candidate Obama. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=655.08s)]
*  And I do that as a matter of fact. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=660.08s)]
*  Actually, I meet, Margaret, with senators like Senator Schumer who came here recently [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=661.64s)]
*  with a large Democratic delegation or Republicans who came with, for example, Mitch McConnell. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=666.48s)]
*  Just recently. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=672.52s)]
*  We're talking about the last few weeks. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=673.52s)]
*  I've met equally, 50-50, I've checked the numbers, 50 percent, 50 percent, with Republicans [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=674.76s)]
*  and Democrats, hundreds and hundreds of them, governors, senators, members of Congress. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=680.2s)]
*  And let me tell you, I do that so regularly and so frequently that members of the Knesset, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=685.0s)]
*  our parliament, complain that I meet with American lawmakers and executives more than [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=692.5200000000001s)]
*  I do with them. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=698.6s)]
*  So that sounds like you're saying... [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=699.6s)]
*  But it reflects the fact that I think that the bipartisan relationship with America is [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=701.6400000000001s)]
*  vital for Israel. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=706.12s)]
*  Is that a yes, your meeting with Ron DeSantis? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=707.32s)]
*  Of course, I'll meet with everyone. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=709.44s)]
*  Why not? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=712.6400000000001s)]
*  I meet with Republican governors and Democratic governors. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=713.6400000000001s)]
*  I'm not avoiding the question, and actually I'm rushing right into it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=716.48s)]
*  I meet with every American representative, governor, senator, members of Congress, and [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=720.08s)]
*  I think it's my job. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=726.36s)]
*  And I think it's important for Israel's bipartisan support in the United States. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=728.6800000000001s)]
*  I make a point of it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=733.5600000000001s)]
*  Because for the first time, there was a poll from Gallup last month that showed Democrats [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  are likelier to sympathize with Palestinians than with Israelis for the first time. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=738.04s)]
*  I know it's easy to dismiss polls, but this seems to be a reflection of public sentiment [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=743.4399999999999s)]
*  in the United States that relates directly to Israel's influence in America. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=748.52s)]
*  Forty-nine percent of Democrats sympathize with Palestinians, 38 percent with Israelis. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=754.7199999999999s)]
*  Do you think that matters? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=760.12s)]
*  Yeah, I do think it matters, and I think we have to work harder to persuade our Democratic [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=761.12s)]
*  colleagues, or those of those our Democratic colleagues who forget perhaps that Israel [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=767.96s)]
*  is the solitary democracy in the Middle East, that America has no better friend and no better [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=774.6800000000001s)]
*  ally than Israel. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=779.48s)]
*  But I'll tell you why I think this happens. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=780.88s)]
*  First of all, it's happening over time. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=782.1600000000001s)]
*  It happened over time. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=784.08s)]
*  It's not related to this or that administration in Israel because it happened, it continued [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=785.08s)]
*  under the previous government as well. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=789.1800000000001s)]
*  I think there is a demonization of Israel in some of the reports, many of the reports [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=791.32s)]
*  that come out of here. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=796.2s)]
*  And I think there is a portion of the American public that finds it hard to understand that [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=797.36s)]
*  once you enter the realm of nations, you have to act to defend yourself. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=802.0s)]
*  And we constantly have to defend ourselves against terrorism that is aimed against our [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=807.8000000000001s)]
*  people. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=813.24s)]
*  And sometimes when that happens, you have what are called collateral damage, which means [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=814.24s)]
*  civilian casualties that are unfortunate. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=817.6400000000001s)]
*  They're not deliberate. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=819.6s)]
*  And that often enables the—a vilification of Israel to take place. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=821.12s)]
*  And I think we have to work hard to persuade both sides of the aisle— [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=826.96s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=831.24s)]
*  —and the independents in between. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=832.24s)]
*  Yes, both sides of the aisle, and in this case, Democrats, because we have solid support [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=833.88s)]
*  among independents and solid support among Republicans and considerable support among [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=840.9200000000001s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=845.36s)]
*  But I'm not going to give up. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=846.36s)]
*  I'm going to do everything I can to tell the truth about Israel, that it's a vibrant [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=847.36s)]
*  democracy, that it's the only one that keeps full civil rights in the Middle East and a [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=851.32s)]
*  very broad radius, that America has no better friend, that Israeli intelligence, cybersecurity [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=856.52s)]
*  and defense cooperation with the United States has saved countless American and Israeli lives. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=862.24s)]
*  I don't think America has a better ally than Israel anywhere on the planet. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=867.5600000000001s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for your time this morning. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=873.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=877.28s)]
*  And happy Independence Day for us, and I hope for you, too. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=878.28s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=882.6800000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbslkiAypfw&t=886.48s)]
