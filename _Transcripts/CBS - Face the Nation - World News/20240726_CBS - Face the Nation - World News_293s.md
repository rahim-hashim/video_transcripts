# France's high-speed rail system hit by arson attacks ahead of Olympics opening ceremony
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA)
*  Hours before the official start of the Olympic Games, France's high-speed rail system has been severely disrupted by several arson attacks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=0.0s)]
*  The country's prime minister says the acts were, quote, carried out in a prepared and coordinated manner. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=9.0s)]
*  Authorities haven't announced any arrests yet, and no injuries have been reported. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=15.0s)]
*  CBS Saturday morning co-host Dana Jacobson is on the ground in Paris following this story for us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=19.0s)]
*  She's also a CBS News and sports correspondent. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=24.0s)]
*  Dana, good to see you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=26.0s)]
*  Dana, this was coordinated. What do we know right now? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=28.0s)]
*  Lindsay, good to see you too. And that's exactly right. And the National Train Company is saying the same. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=32.0s)]
*  There are four basic lines. Think of it as the north, the east, the southeast, and the west. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=37.0s)]
*  The west, the Atlantique, was affected by this the most seriously, as was the north and the east. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=42.0s)]
*  And what we know is some cables, basically clusters of cables, were doused with fuel and then set on fire. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=49.0s)]
*  They were able to thwart the fourth attack as some members of the train, I guess, security and also workers, they saw something going on and able to scare people away. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=56.0s)]
*  But on those other three lines, major disruptions, cancellations, delays because of those fires. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=67.0s)]
*  Now, this is similar to an attack that was seen in 2023. And in that attack, a far-left group claimed responsibility. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=72.0s)]
*  So right now, a criminal investigation has been launched to investigate who may be behind these attacks. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=79.0s)]
*  As you mentioned, it was an attack as they're looking into it for criminal reasons, not necessarily for terrorist reasons, but it's way too early to say on that front where we are. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=85.0s)]
*  So what impact is this having on travelers, on logistics? I imagine with the opening ceremonies kicking off today, the games officially beginning, there are still the wrongs of tourists trying to get there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=94.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's two things. There are a lot of people that are here in Paris are trying to get out. It's a big vacation time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=106.0s)]
*  So at least 800,000 people have been affected by this. I mentioned delays and cancellations. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=110.0s)]
*  So as of this afternoon, the trains got back up and running a little bit. Think of it as one in three trains were running and going. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=115.0s)]
*  We also found out earlier that there were four trains that were carrying athletes. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=122.0s)]
*  And what we've been told by the rail line is that all of those athletes got transportation here to the opening ceremony that we're coming now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=126.0s)]
*  Not all the athletes attend the opening ceremony, but at least 7,000 are expected to be here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=133.0s)]
*  So good news, at least for those athletes and for the rest, they've warned that this will take all weekend and people need to have a lot of patience. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=138.0s)]
*  If they can delay travel, they're asking them to do so. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=144.0s)]
*  Wow. Fascinating that athletes were part of this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=146.0s)]
*  So you mentioned too early still to tell exactly motive and all of that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=149.0s)]
*  But you have been covering security there and and what it feels like, what it looks like. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=154.0s)]
*  Will there be any difference in security posture in light of this? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=159.0s)]
*  Well, security was already on a heightened alert at this point. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=163.0s)]
*  They have 45,000 on hand just for the opening ceremony every day. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=168.0s)]
*  Thirty to forty five thousand security officials will be somewhere around plus twenty thousand private security officials. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=173.0s)]
*  And an attack like this is something that they were aware of, something that could happen, may not be the ones that you think of, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=180.0s)]
*  but certainly cause disruption. So it may not change how they go about things. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=188.0s)]
*  It's something simply that they will continue to watch for. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=192.0s)]
*  You know, this is on a much lighter note, but the threat right now, not just any threats that may be to people who are here or the environment. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=195.0s)]
*  We have our opening ceremonies tonight. Mother Nature is taking her shot. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=203.0s)]
*  We have a 60 to 80 percent chance of rain, an inch to an inch and a quarter is expected. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=207.0s)]
*  It's about 15 days worth of rain that you would normally get. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=213.0s)]
*  And that's a problem not only for the opening ceremonies, but also because remember they're using the sand, the river here for swimming events. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=217.0s)]
*  And the more rain that there is, it affects the filtration system. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=224.0s)]
*  So everybody will be watching that. So obviously there are several different things. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=227.0s)]
*  And I know it's very different security versus that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=230.0s)]
*  But can I just say that people are still excited for the opening ceremonies to take place along the river? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=233.0s)]
*  It's something that goes with any big event. When we talked to a security expert earlier in the week, he said you have a large event like this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=239.0s)]
*  There is always risk. You can never get rid of it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=244.0s)]
*  The things that they are always aware of are attacks potentially like what we saw with the trains that again right now they have no direct link to the Olympics and also lone actor attacks possibly. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=247.0s)]
*  Just think of, you know, somebody with a knife and a crowd of people and then larger scale events that could possibly happen. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=259.0s)]
*  So security is on high alert for all of those. We were told by French authorities there are about a thousand people that leading up to the Olympics, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=266.0s)]
*  they've removed from having the ability to be here based on potential threats and believing that they could be bad actors on behalf of other nations as well. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=273.0s)]
*  So while we hear about the things that did happen, we often hear less about the things that are thwarted. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=282.0s)]
*  And there have been several leading up to the games. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=287.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=289.0s)]
*  Dana Jacobson following it all for us. Thank you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rl7XOjjhZA&t=290.0s)]
