# Gaza needs "significant scaling up" of humanitarian aid, U.N. official Philippe Lazzarini says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU)
*  Philippe Lazzarini is the Commissioner General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=0.0s)]
*  for Palestinian Refugees. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  The U.S. is its largest donor. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=7.28s)]
*  Good afternoon to you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=9.6s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  I want to go straight to questions, but I did want to first acknowledge our condolences. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=14.8s)]
*  I saw that 29 of your employees were killed in Gaza, according to the announcement, some [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=22.12s)]
*  while sleeping in their beds at home during these bombings. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=28.48s)]
*  We're sorry. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=33.52s)]
*  Can you tell us what people at home need to know about what's happening inside of Gaza [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=34.52s)]
*  right now? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Listen, Gaza is an unprecedented humanitarian crisis which is unfolding under our watch. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  We have one million people who have moved from their home. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=50.2s)]
*  The Gaza City has been, entire neighborhood have been flattened down. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=53.92s)]
*  Hospitals have been hit. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=59.72s)]
*  People in our shelter have been hit. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  More than 30 installations of the UN have been also hit. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=64.2s)]
*  Thousands of people have been killed there. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=69.4s)]
*  And as you indicated, we have 29 staff also killed among our workers. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=71.48s)]
*  They are all teachers, doctors, gynecologists, psychosocial workers. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=77.28s)]
*  And certainly, we might have more people to come. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=81.96s)]
*  What we know also is Gaza is under a total siege until yesterday. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely nothing entered into Gaza. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=92.36s)]
*  Well I saw that those 20 trucks did make it in yesterday through the Rafa gate, but that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=97.28s)]
*  the UN estimates that's what, 4% of an average day imports. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=103.0s)]
*  Secretary Blinken said he expects more trucks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=108.36s)]
*  What do you know about what aid is coming? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=111.48s)]
*  But what we need is a significant scaling up of a supply line into Gaza, and it needs [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=116.08s)]
*  to be sustained, and it needs to be uninterrupted. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=123.12s)]
*  Before October 7, we had up to 500 trucks entering into Gaza, and this was under a blockade. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=126.44s)]
*  At the time, already 80% of the population was dependent on international assistance. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=134.32s)]
*  So we need Margaret much more than that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  Understood. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=145.48s)]
*  I do want you to address something though that got a lot of political attention here [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=146.48s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  There was a tweet from your agency that strongly implied aid was being taken by authorities [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=152.48s)]
*  who have links to Hamas. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=157.68s)]
*  That tweet was then deleted from your account, and UNRWA issued a statement saying no looting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=160.16s)]
*  had taken place. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=166.46s)]
*  Was there looting? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=169.88s)]
*  Is aid ending up in the hands of terrorists? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=171.06s)]
*  There was absolutely no looting. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=174.82s)]
*  Medicine and fuel have been taken from our headquarters in Gaza, in Gaza City, and has [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=178.2s)]
*  been handed over to local health workers coordinated with the local coordinator of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=186.2s)]
*  the World Health Organization. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  And this material ended up in the various hospitals, and the fuel which has been taken [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=196.56s)]
*  also ended up in the hospital. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  And you are running short on fuel now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  Today I issued a statement, an alarm, because in three, four days we will have no fuel anymore [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=210.08s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=217.56s)]
*  And what does it mean? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=218.56s)]
*  No fuel, no water, no bakery, no running hospital. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  But beyond that, that means also there will be no humanitarian operation. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  We need fuel to move the trucks to reach the people in need. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  This week you said UNRWA was on the verge of collapse. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=238.06s)]
*  There was already a $75 million shortfall. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=241.66s)]
*  President Biden did announce that the U.S. would provide about $100 million to help Palestinians [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=245.98s)]
*  in Gaza and the West Bank from already allocated funds. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=252.38s)]
*  Will that help your organization? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=255.94s)]
*  As you mentioned, the U.S. is our largest donor for the time being. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=257.98s)]
*  I do not know yet to break down of this $100 million additional, but it is true that our [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=264.46000000000004s)]
*  agency has been weakened for one decade of financial crisis. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=271.26s)]
*  And if there is no input of additional financial resources, we will certainly not be up to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=276.46000000000004s)]
*  the challenge. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  And we are, for the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, but also in the West Bank, the main [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  lifeline and the main hope for them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=291.14s)]
*  You are essentially filling the void of a government in providing some of these services. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=295.06s)]
*  UNRWA, will it be able to continue operating after Israel launches this expected ground [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=300.78s)]
*  invasion? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=307.65999999999997s)]
*  Listen, I have no intent to interrupt any operation. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=309.97999999999996s)]
*  We have to continue to advocate to keep the border open, to bring fuel inside, to bring [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=314.97999999999996s)]
*  the supply inside and also asking to the Israeli and also the armed group in the Gaza [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=321.02s)]
*  Strip, the Hamas, not to target any civilian infrastructure, not to target our shelter [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  where we have half a million people seeking protection in the UNRWA school. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=334.78s)]
*  And basically, whether there is a ground invasion or not, we need to continue to provide [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=340.58s)]
*  assistance and protection to the civilian more than ever. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=346.62s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner General, for your time. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxY-6UXBQU&t=350.94s)]
