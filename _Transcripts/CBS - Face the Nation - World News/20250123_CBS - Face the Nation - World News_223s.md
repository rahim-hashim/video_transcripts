# Trump closes immigration operations opened by Biden in Latin America
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s)
*  At the direction of President Trump, about 1,500 troops are being deployed to the southern border [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=0.0s)]
*  with increased operations to block illegal migrant crossings set to start in the coming days. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=4.48s)]
*  CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez joins me now. So Camilo, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=9.84s)]
*  we'll get to that in a minute, but I want to ask you about your new reporting about President Trump [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=14.88s)]
*  closing immigration offices in Latin America. What can you tell us and what is significant about that? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=18.64s)]
*  Hi, Lindsay. We obtained internal State Department documents that show that the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=24.8s)]
*  Trump administration has directed officials to cease operations at offices that the Biden [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=28.88s)]
*  administration set up in Latin America, in Colombia, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Guatemala, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=35.12s)]
*  to essentially screen immigrants there and to offer them a legal and safe alternative to crossing the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=41.2s)]
*  U.S.-Mexico border. Illegally, the Biden administration argued, Lindsay, that these offices, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=48.16s)]
*  alongside other legal immigration pathways, would dissuade and discourage migrants thinking [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=54.16s)]
*  about crossing the border illegally from doing so, and instead to wait and to apply for these legal [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=60.16s)]
*  immigration programs. But the Trump administration, according to this memo, Lindsay, is now [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=66.8s)]
*  reassessing how these programs actually serve U.S. national interests. That is the wording of this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=72.64s)]
*  memo and thus is shutting these offices down in Latin America. This is obviously part of a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=80.64s)]
*  broader effort by the Trump administration to really dismantle the Biden administration's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=87.44s)]
*  immigration legacy, Lindsay. What more do we know about the troops heading to the southern border [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=92.48s)]
*  and what they'll be doing? Well, we know that the Trump administration has directed the Department [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=96.32s)]
*  of Defense to deploy at least 1,500 U.S. Marines and Army personnel to El Paso and San Diego sectors [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=101.68s)]
*  in Texas and California to help customs and border protection in an operational capacity, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=109.28s)]
*  including to help the agency set up border barriers to repel migrants from crossing into the U.S. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=115.28s)]
*  illegally. That is on top, Lindsay, of the 2,500 troops that were already stationed there [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=121.6s)]
*  under the Biden administration. That has long been a mission of the military to help CBP [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=126.4s)]
*  accomplish its border security mission. But President Trump is seeking to vastly expand [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=132.16s)]
*  that role by also tasking the military, for example, Lindsay, to help the Department of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=139.04s)]
*  Homeland Security deport people to their home countries like Mexico. And that is a step that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=145.04s)]
*  we understand now the military is prepared to do. So that is a big change. However, we should, of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=150.56s)]
*  course, underscore that the military is barred under longstanding law from actually processing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  migrants and arresting them. What can you tell us about a new memo that suggests involvement by the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=163.28s)]
*  DOJ? Well, as part of this massive deportation operation that President Trump has been promising, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=168.32s)]
*  his administration this week directed the Department of Homeland Security to grant the authority [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  to certain Justice Department law enforcement agencies to find, arrest, and detain people who [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=182.48s)]
*  are here in violation of federal immigration law. So undocumented immigrants who are here [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=189.2s)]
*  without proper documents now, certain agencies within the DOJ, such as the DEA, FBI, and the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=194.72s)]
*  U.S. Marshals Service, as well as the ATF, can now have immigration authorities and can be deputized [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=201.36s)]
*  as immigration officers. Agents in those offices can be deputized as immigration officers to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=209.12s)]
*  arrest and deport people who are in the country illegally. Lindsay. Camilo Montoya-Galvez, thank you. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=215.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscvWRCQz2s&t=221.6s)]
