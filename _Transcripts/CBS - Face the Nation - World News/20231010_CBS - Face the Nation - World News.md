*  I visited israel for the first time [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=616.48s)]
*  As a newly elected senator [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=619.2s)]
*  And I had a long long trip [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=622.8000000000001s)]
*  Meeting with golda mayer in her office [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=626.48s)]
*  Just before the yom kippur war [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=630.16s)]
*  And I guess you could see [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=635.04s)]
*  The consternation of my face as she described what was being faced [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=637.36s)]
*  They were facing [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=641.84s)]
*  We walked outside in that that sort of hallway outside her office [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=644.4s)]
*  To have some photos she looked at me all of a sudden said would you like to have a photograph? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=650.5600000000001s)]
*  And so I got up and followed her out [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=656.88s)]
*  We're standing there silent looking at the press she could tell I guess I was concerned [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=659.52s)]
*  She leaned over and whispered to me. She said don't worry senator biden [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=665.44s)]
*  We have a secret weapon here in israel [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=670.4000000000001s)]
*  My word is what she said we have no place else to go [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=674.24s)]
*  We have no place else to go [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=680.4s)]
*  For 75 years is it as soon as the only guarantor of security of jewish people around the world [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=684.48s)]
*  So that the atrocities of the past could never happen again [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=692.88s)]
*  And let there be no doubt [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=696.5600000000001s)]
*  The united states has israel's back [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=698.96s)]
*  We will make sure the jewish and democratic state of israel can defend itself today tomorrow as we always have [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=702.08s)]
*  It's as simple as that [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=709.44s)]
*  these atrocities [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  I've been sickening [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=714.1600000000001s)]
*  We're with israel let's make no mistake. Thank you. Mr. President. What was your reaction? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=717.2800000000001s)]
*  And there you have it the president of the united states stating clearly that the united states [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=732.1600000000001s)]
*  stands behind [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=738.1600000000001s)]
*  Israel and denouncing the acts of terror as sheer evil [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=739.82s)]
*  Going into specifics about the number of civilians who have been slaughtered in his words [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=744.8000000000001s)]
*  babies women raped and paraded in the president's words [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  Uh, he is giving some wide latitude to the israeli government to strike back at hamas [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=756.16s)]
*  But is trying to prevent civilian casualties. I want to bring in our senior force foreign correspondent holly williams [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  Who is also with me here in tel aviv the president also saying there are now 14 [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=769.04s)]
*  Americans among the dead and there are a number of american hostages, but he did not say how many [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=775.34s)]
*  How does this complicate that planned invasion of gaza that's news isn't it nora americans amongst the hostages [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=782.64s)]
*  Hamas is using those hostages to try and blackmail israel saying that they won't negotiate a prisoner swap until the israeli [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=790.08s)]
*  Strike stop even threatening to execute [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=797.04s)]
*  One of those hostages every time that is israel bombs palestinian civilians civilians with no warning [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=800.16s)]
*  Um [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=807.1999999999999s)]
*  This is really a kind of blackmail that hamas is using [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=808.7199999999999s)]
*  And israel is acting at this point as if it's not hand [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=812.56s)]
*  But I think the reality is that this is a political problem for israel because on the one hand [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=816.7199999999999s)]
*  They want and need to punish hamas [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=821.68s)]
*  But on the other hand the family members of every single one of those hostages will be demanding that israel's government brings their loved ones home [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=824.24s)]
*  safe [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=832.8s)]
*  And how does that carry itself out? We know that the israeli defense forces have already called up [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=834.0s)]
*  360 000 reserve forces some of those reservists are coming from america here to help [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=840.78s)]
*  Israel fight there are already 35 battalions on the border with gaza. What happens? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=847.92s)]
*  How are they softening targets now? Yeah israel is clearly going on the intent on the offensive [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=854.24s)]
*  They're hammering the gaza strip with airstrikes a ground invasion is expected in the days to come [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=860.0s)]
*  As I said israel's acting as if the hostages don't impact impact that but I spoke to a former [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=867.52s)]
*  Israeli intelligence officer just a few days ago who said the hostages have a massive impact [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=873.8199999999999s)]
*  And he doesn't know how the israeli government is going to deal with that [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=878.64s)]
*  Holly williams [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=883.04s)]
*  I know you have been reporting on the southern border and will continue what you have learned tonight on the cbs evening news [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=883.92s)]
*  Thank you very much. Also want to bring in our senior white house correspondent [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=890.24s)]
*  Weijia jang and weijia. I know the president has been working the phones since this conflict began [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=894.4799999999999s)]
*  four days ago [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=901.12s)]
*  This is a hurried diplomatic effort [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=902.88s)]
*  It is nora and he actually had a phone call yesterday with big western allies france germany the uk and italy [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=905.8399999999999s)]
*  That resulted in a joint statement because the issue here is not only supporting israel [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=913.36s)]
*  But he wants to send the message of deterrence to any potential bad actors who want to exploit this situation [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=918.64s)]
*  That there is a coordinated effort to stand beside israel and make sure it has everything it needs to defend itself [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=925.52s)]
*  It's also notable nora that the president made this speech fresh off that meeting [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=934.08s)]
*  In the situation room and we spotted one national security advisor who is an expert in hostage affairs [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=938.9599999999999s)]
*  And as you and holly were talking about [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=946.2399999999999s)]
*  He just made news that the administration has confirmed that americans are among the hostages that hamas has taken [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=948.88s)]
*  We also know that the administration has offered support has offered to put forth hostage [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=956.0s)]
*  Negotiators and members of the intelligence community to aid in this effort [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=962.54s)]
*  But I have to tell you nor there is [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=966.24s)]
*  A frustration here because they say we are relying on the families who are telling us that their loved ones are not there [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=968.32s)]
*  We don't know how many people are missing and we certainly at this point do not know how to track and find them [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=975.12s)]
*  But they have vowed to do everything they can to try to reconnect those hostages, especially americans nora [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=981.92s)]
*  Nora [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=989.36s)]
*  We're jay jang at the white house. Thank you also want to bring in our chief washington correspondent major garrett and [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=991.52s)]
*  Major let's talk about how the united states is assisting the israelis the president mentioning this [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=998.48s)]
*  us [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1005.6s)]
*  Strike carrier group the uss ford on its way here [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1006.5600000000001s)]
*  There's also talk at the pentagon about sending another aircraft carrier of course deploying additional munitions and help [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1009.36s)]
*  To resupply the iron dome. This is you could see an all hands on deck process [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1016.4s)]
*  Yes, the president made clear. He will move whatever u.s [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1022.0s)]
*  Assets militarily make sense to reinforce the israelis as they continue this war [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1024.8s)]
*  That's benjamin not net yahoo's word against hamas in gaza. He also talked the president did about asking congress for assistance [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1030.08s)]
*  But congress is disorganized the house of representatives isn't even functioning right now nora [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1039.04s)]
*  So the pentagon and the administration will use whatever available resources it has under law now [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1044.16s)]
*  But until the house organizes itself [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1049.76s)]
*  It is not a co-legislative partner in providing future needs for the united states to assist israel [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1051.6000000000001s)]
*  That is a huge concern here in america one other thing [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1057.92s)]
*  What's the relationship between benjamin net yahoo and president biden? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1061.68s)]
*  Well, it last decades started in the early 80s when biden was a young senator and benjamin net yahoo was an upcoming [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1064.88s)]
*  Aid within the israeli embassy here in washington. They know each other well [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1072.0s)]
*  There have been strains in this relationship periodically but forged in fire. They are now as the president made clear [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1075.84s)]
*  This is a different context [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1082.32s)]
*  Barbarity of this magnitude the president said cannot be ignored and will be dealt with first by israel and also [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1084.3799999999999s)]

*  for israel [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1175.74s)]
*  Well, I think he wanted to leave no doubt jureka that the u.s. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1177.66s)]
*  views this as a an immoral terrorist attack by hamas that this was [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1182.46s)]
*  Murder pure and simple. I mean you talked about the fact that he called it pure unadulterated evil [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1189.3400000000001s)]

*  Uses palestinians as human shields to carry out its atrocities [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1216.86s)]
*  So he was setting out very clearly [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1222.62s)]
*  How the u.s. Views hamas this is not some military conflict between two countries that have a dispute [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1225.98s)]

*  in other words, he is going to be looking for more funding for assistance to [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1273.74s)]
*  Israel and that sends an even clearer signal to congress that they need to figure out their leadership situation sooner rather than later [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1279.02s)]
*  Because he wants them to pass a package of aid. He also mentioned and we we knew this [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1287.82s)]

*  Israel it was notable that there was a hostage affairs expert from the national security council [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1318.06s)]
*  In that picture as well another sign [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1324.54s)]
*  That that the u.s. Views the hostage situation [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1328.6200000000001s)]
*  To be of utmost concern right now, particularly now that we know that there are americans who have been taken hostage [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1332.22s)]
*  And nancy at the very top of that special report [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1340.38s)]
*  I thought it was interesting too to hear from holly williams talk about speaking with israel body [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1342.86s)]
*  retrieval [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1348.4599999999998s)]
*  Teams to confirm that there were decapitated babies in southern israel one of the places hardest hit and I feel like [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1349.5s)]
*  The president also painted a picture. I know at the rally I was at yesterday for instance [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1357.1s)]
*  Some people were asking me why aren't you showing pictures of this and why aren't you showing pictures of that? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1362.78s)]
*  And you know what we were able to show even yesterday was pretty brutal but in reference to children [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1367.74s)]
*  And women and the president really gave us that picture when he said, you know an act of sheer evil [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1373.3400000000001s)]
*  Over a thousand slaughtered among at least 14 americans as you mentioned, but he said babies [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1379.5s)]
*  Being killed women raped assaulted and paraded as trophies when you hear that [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1384.3000000000002s)]
*  Matched with some of the imagery that not only that people are seeing in the news, but that's circulating online [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1390.46s)]
*  Um, it increases this anger and sadness that I feel like a lot of people [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1396.7s)]
*  Um have talked about [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1401.9s)]
*  Right. He described it as as bloodthirstiness [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1403.9s)]
*  And he said it really recalls some of the most brutal brutal acts [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1407.18s)]
*  by isis which is [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1412.3000000000002s)]
*  of course, a major [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1414.22s)]
*  terrorist group that the u.s [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1416.6200000000001s)]
*  Dismantled piece by piece and I think it's not an accident that he brought up isis because he was clearly looking to send the [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1419.0800000000002s)]
*  Signal that hamas you may be next [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1425.98s)]
*  Um, and he also made a point to mention that there were victims of the holocaust [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1429.66s)]
*  Yeah from the 1940s who were taken hostage. So these are individuals [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1436.6200000000001s)]
*  Who are [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1443.02s)]
*  In their 80s or 90s? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1444.38s)]
*  Who had been taken? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1447.1s)]
*  Hostage who have already lived through so much. I thought it was also notable jerica [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1449.18s)]
*  That the president said that um that israel has every right to respond he made that [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1455.74s)]
*  Abundantly clear. He said he just got off of his third call with the prime minister [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1463.24s)]
*  And what he told him was that our response the u.s response if something like this had happened to us would be swift [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1468.38s)]
*  decisive and overwhelming [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1476.04s)]
*  So essentially what he was doing there jerica was basically saying to the world [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1478.54s)]
*  Hey, whatever israel does now [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1483.5800000000002s)]
*  To defend itself to go after hamas. This is exactly what the united states the world's policeman [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1485.98s)]
*  Would be doing as well. So throwing his entire support behind [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1493.8200000000002s)]
*  Israel and he said something else I thought was equally notable. He said that anyone who's thinking of taking advantage of this situation [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1499.0800000000002s)]
*  Uh, our heart may be broken, but our aims are clear [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1506.22s)]
*  Don't try it. Yeah, I mean and even as he said those statements it was he said don't [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1510.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, simple as that. Um a lot was was shared in terms of again painting the picture [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1515.98s)]
*  Still a lot of questions, but uh, it is clear [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1521.66s)]
*  I think it has been clear where the president and many lawmakers stand on this issue [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1524.6200000000001s)]
*  Nancy cordis again. Thank you so much for helping us understand and break everything down and guiding us through this conversation [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1529.42s)]
*  We will see you later on america decides but right now we're going to take a quick break ahead [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1536.24s)]
*  We'll have the very latest on the standoff in congress. You're streaming cbs news. Stay with us [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLmYzN0qMKs&t=1541.4399999999998s)]
