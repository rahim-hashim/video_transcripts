# Plane carrying prisoners from Russia lands in Turkey after deal announced
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM)
*  All right, if you're just joining us, we are following breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=0.0s)]
*  A major prisoner swap is underway between the U.S. and Russia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=5.28s)]
*  Americans Evan Gurskiewicz and Paul Whelan are among the list of prisoners to be freed. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=9.6s)]
*  Also among them, American-Russian journalist Alsuk Hermasheva, also believed to be headed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=14.3s)]
*  home. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=19.8s)]
*  We have CBS News intelligence and national security reporter Olivia Gazes with us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=20.8s)]
*  We also have the former U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, on the phone. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=25.0s)]
*  We're going to get to Mr. Sullivan in a bit. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=30.08s)]
*  But Olivia, I want to start with you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=32.44s)]
*  If you can talk about who else is included in this swap. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=34.86s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=38.16s)]
*  I think we're still learning those details as they're being released. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=39.16s)]
*  We do know that it is a constellation of prisoners that the Russians have held and that the U.S. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=43.54s)]
*  has held. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=49.64s)]
*  The three Americans who are coming home are being given to the Russians at a cost, right? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=51.64s)]
*  We do know that the Russians were keenly interested in a convicted murderer held in a German prison [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=57.92s)]
*  known as Vadim Krasikov. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  He assassinated a Chechen Georgian who fought against Russian troops in Chechnya and had [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=65.44s)]
*  been serving a life sentence in Germany. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=73.16s)]
*  We understood the Russians to be keenly interested in him. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=75.48s)]
*  But of course, he wasn't in the U.S.'s custody. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=78.32s)]
*  So we have to see whether that he was part of the final deal that finally got this over [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=81.52s)]
*  the finish line. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=86.8s)]
*  We understand that it is one of the most complex deals, as officials who were involved in it [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=88.13999999999999s)]
*  described it to me, in U.S. Russian and even U.S. Soviet history, when again, spy swaps [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=93.08s)]
*  were the norm. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=98.52s)]
*  In 2014, there was a massive spy swap between the U.S. and Russia in which 10 Russians went [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  back and officials said this was even more complex than that one. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=106.52s)]
*  Olivia, these three Americans coming home certainly cause to celebrate, but there are [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=110.2s)]
*  other Americans still being held in Russia. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=116.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=118.56s)]
*  It is important to note that this is a huge success. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=119.56s)]
*  These three Americans had a lot of attention paid to their cases. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  In the cases of Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich, they were deemed wrongfully detained by the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=127.28s)]
*  U.S. government. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=132.12s)]
*  The U.S. case got personal attention from President Biden and was going through the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=133.72s)]
*  State Department's deliberative process in terms of determining whether she was officially [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  wrongfully detained. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=142.28s)]
*  But there are still a number of Americans who are held in Russian prisoners, among them [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=143.82s)]
*  a teacher, Mark Fogel, whose family has also been very vocal in trying to get him released. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=148.44s)]
*  There's a musician recently taken named Michael Travis Leake, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Gordon [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=154.76s)]
*  Black recently imprisoned. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=159.8s)]
*  And a Russian-American ballerina, Ksenia Karolina, who remains imprisoned. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=162.56s)]
*  Their cases probably not as clear cut. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=167.6s)]
*  Again, the U.S. has a very specific deliberative process through which it determines whether [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  these are actually political prisoners or whether, as Ambassador Sullivan was describing, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=174.28s)]
*  they committed some minor infraction or even broke a Russian law and therefore received [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=179.16s)]
*  outsized punishments by the Russian government. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  Olivia, what type of conversations had to have been taken place to involve so many agencies [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=186.72s)]
*  and so many countries? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=191.54s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=192.82s)]
*  Well, we know from past cases that the Russians don't like to deal with diplomats as much [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=193.82s)]
*  as they like to deal with intelligence officers. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=198.82s)]
*  Very often these cases are handled by the CIA, which has run point in the past for very [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=202.22s)]
*  sensitive negotiations, including Brittany Greiner. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=207.7s)]
*  And that's more the Russians' preference than the U.S. preference. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=211.34s)]
*  I think the U.S. would have preferred to engage diplomatically in all of these cases, so it [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=214.62s)]
*  was not to lend credence to the idea that either Paul Whelan or Evan Gershkovich had [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=220.02s)]
*  in any way connections to the agency or to espionage or to any sort of activity of that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=225.18s)]
*  kind. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=232.38s)]
*  And that's why they would have preferred diplomatic channels. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=233.38s)]
*  But the Russians often insist on keeping things quiet, on wheling dealing and on dealing with [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=235.70000000000002s)]
*  the CIA via their intelligence services in these kinds of discussions. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=243.3s)]
*  How can you tell us about the process where the U.S. government tries to determine when [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=248.62s)]
*  Russia accuses an American, how does the U.S. government respond to that and determine that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=252.9s)]
*  somebody is actually a political prisoner? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=257.53999999999996s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=260.14s)]
*  It can be a lengthy process, and there are strict guidelines by which it is done. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=261.14s)]
*  When an American is detained anywhere overseas, U.S. officials immediately request consular [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=266.09999999999997s)]
*  access to that person. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=271.84s)]
*  They try to get a lawyer in the room, they try to get U.S. diplomats in the room to understand [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=273.18s)]
*  what exactly has come to pass, what the person may be charged with or what the allegations [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  are. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=282.26s)]
*  From there, there is a, it's not a public process, but it is a deliberative process [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=283.26s)]
*  within the SPIHA, which is the Special Presidential Envoy's Office, who will determine whether [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=287.94s)]
*  their cases actually violated a local law or whether this is, again, somebody taken [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=295.54s)]
*  capriciously by a foreign government and is being held as a political prisoner. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  There's no visibility into that process, but it has guidelines established by Congress [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=305.86s)]
*  that the U.S. uses in order to officially declare somebody wrongfully detained or not. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=310.26s)]
*  Well, Olivia, as we're having this conversation, we have live pictures of the plane landing [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=315.3s)]
*  in Turkey now carrying these Americans home. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=320.02000000000004s)]
*  What were, Evan Gurskowitz, Paul Whelan, Alsuk Kermasheva, what were they facing if this [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=324.54s)]
*  deal didn't happen as far as a life in a prison in Russia? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=329.76s)]
*  Well, let's start a moment. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=336.78s)]
*  Let's just pause. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=337.78s)]
*  I mean, the fact that we're getting pictures of an exchange in Turkey is absolutely historic. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=338.78s)]
*  Obviously, a third country that everybody needed to agree on for this swap to take place. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=343.02s)]
*  I got chills when you told me that it was actually happening, an incredible moment in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=348.42s)]
*  which a very hard-fought negotiation appears to have succeeded. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=352.94s)]
*  In all of these cases, Paul Whelan, again, was the longest-held American detainee in [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  Russia, was in a penal colony, was beaten, had his things taken away, was abused, told [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=364.78s)]
*  these stories when he managed to get them out of the Russian penal colony where he was [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=371.97999999999996s)]
*  being held. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=377.2s)]
*  He was sentenced to 16 years in that kind of a Russian prison for charges that, again, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=378.44s)]
*  the U.S. has insisted were trumped up. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=384.26s)]
*  His family has said are absolutely false, and he, of course, has maintained his innocence [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=386.62s)]
*  throughout. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=390.76s)]
*  He was arrested during a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in 2023, guilty of nothing more [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=392.76s)]
*  as we have heard the slogans than committing the act of journalism, which, of course, is [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=398.36s)]
*  not a crime. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=402.48s)]
*  But he was sentenced in a very hasty trial in early July to also 16 years in a Russian [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=404.02s)]
*  penal colony. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=411.28s)]
*  We saw the pictures of him in the Russian cell. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=412.48s)]
*  We could not hear him, but we saw him at some points try to express optimism, holding up [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  a heart symbol, smiling for the press. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=421.76000000000005s)]
*  And we have routinely heard U.S. government officials who have met with them, diplomats [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=425.44000000000005s)]
*  on the ground in Russia, describe them as resilient, as strong, as really keeping up [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=429.8s)]
*  their spirits in the face of incredible adversity for years, and in Wieland's case, years and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=436.0s)]
*  years. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=441.20000000000005s)]
*  And as we watch these pictures, the live picture of the plane bringing these Americans home, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=442.20000000000005s)]
*  you have to think about the families who have been afraid that they may never see their [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  loved ones again. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  I want to bring in White House correspondent for the Associated Press, Zeke Miller. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=451.4s)]
*  Zeke, can you tell us, have we heard anything from the White House? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=455.32s)]
*  We have not heard anything from the White House, and I would not expect to hear anything [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=459.92s)]
*  from them until these Americans are wheels up back to the United States. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=463.92s)]
*  That's something that we've seen in other reported prisoner swaps that have taken place. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=469.84s)]
*  Under multiple administrations, they are very tight-lipped until the moment where they are [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=474.96s)]
*  in U.S. custody and out of Russian custody and on their way safely back to their families. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=479.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, this is all happening at such a critical time in American politics. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=484.6s)]
*  We're less than 100 days away from an election. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=488.12s)]
*  President Biden just a short time ago said that made the decision to not run for reelection. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=491.56s)]
*  How big a deal is this for the Biden administration? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, this has been one of the major foreign policy priorities of the president. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=501.92s)]
*  In the case of Paul Whelan for pretty much his entire administration and Evan Kershkovitz [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=508.16s)]
*  the last year and change since his detention. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=512.5600000000001s)]
*  So this has certainly been very high on the list for President Biden and his administration. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=515.52s)]
*  And it was one of the things that he mentioned is something that he wanted to get done in [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=521.1600000000001s)]
*  his final six months in office in that Oval Office address just a little over a week ago. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=524.64s)]
*  So being able to actually bring it, you know, show it deliverable on one of his top priorities [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=530.52s)]
*  for the end of his time, if his one and only term in office is certainly a feather in the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  cap for the president's foreign policy legacy that he's trying to show the American people [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=542.96s)]
*  in his closing days with less than six months left before he leaves the White House. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=548.44s)]
*  Zeke, I know the families of Paul Whelan and Evan Kershkovitz have been trying desperately [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=552.12s)]
*  to keep their loved ones in the national spotlight and put pressure on the White House. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=556.72s)]
*  Have you heard as the White House been having conversations with the Whelan family, the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=561.88s)]
*  Kershkovitz family? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=565.84s)]
*  Has there been a lot of pressure to make this happen? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=567.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, there's certainly been ongoing conversations between the White House, the State Department, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  other U.S. government officials and the Whelan Kershkovitz family. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=576.9200000000001s)]
*  The families of all detained Americans, not just in Russia, but in other countries as [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=581.76s)]
*  well, that's been a priority of the Biden administration. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=585.0s)]
*  It was also a priority of the Trump administration to sort of keep an open line of communication [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=586.6800000000001s)]
*  them feel seen, making them feel heard. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=593.92s)]
*  In different contexts, we've seen that from the White House, the Biden administration, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=596.36s)]
*  with the case of American citizens who were detained in Hamas captivity in the October [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=599.8s)]
*  7th attack in Israel. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=605.4799999999999s)]
*  So that has been sort of a hallmark of how the U.S. government, you know, in over really [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=607.36s)]
*  over the last decade has approached the issue of wrongfully detained or American hostages [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=613.4799999999999s)]
*  you know, transparent, ongoing conversations with the families. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=618.72s)]
*  And certainly, if this deal is concluded, we'll certainly hear a lot more about the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=623.72s)]
*  depth and duration and the cadence of those conversations. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=628.08s)]
*  Again, all of this is happening in the midst of our presidential race. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=632.84s)]
*  Donald Trump has said that if he won the White House again, he would get Evan Kershkovitz [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=637.36s)]
*  released on day one. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=642.1600000000001s)]
*  He has been saying that. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=643.48s)]
*  He has been promising that. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=644.96s)]
*  The fact that this happened today under the Biden administration, how significant is that? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=646.44s)]
*  You know, it certainly does neuter a political message that former President Trump was going [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=652.1600000000001s)]
*  to use on the campaign trail. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=660.12s)]
*  But this is one of those moments that really does transcend politics. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=661.12s)]
*  This is, you know, the return of Americans held overseas, you know, is sort of foundational [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=664.2800000000001s)]
*  to the role of a president of any party. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=671.2s)]
*  So you would sort of like to see some sort of bipartisan consensus around doing this. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  At the same time, you know, it's hard to turn blinders on in a political year. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=679.72s)]
*  Certainly there'll be some sort of politically-tinched reaction, particularly as we learn about the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=684.36s)]
*  other side of that agreement, who had to be traded in order to secure the release of these [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=687.84s)]
*  men. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=693.0s)]
*  And those are very tough policy calls. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=694.0s)]
*  And certainly, there may be some things that some people may criticize. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=696.28s)]
*  So it'll be very interesting to see how, on one hand, you're talking about the very positive [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=700.92s)]
*  release of, potential release of Americans held wrongfully overseas, but also at what [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=705.32s)]
*  cost and how that will play out in the public space and the political space, if someone [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=710.36s)]
*  will have to follow in the days and weeks ahead. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=715.24s)]
*  And we want to mention that we've learned that the families of the released Americans [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=717.24s)]
*  have been invited to the White House. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=720.48s)]
*  Again, we are seeing live pictures of a plane in Turkey carrying these three Americans [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=722.6s)]
*  back home. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=728.52s)]
*  We're still awaiting details as to the specifics of this deal. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=730.32s)]
*  But I want to ask Zeke, is there also the concern about backlash? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=733.88s)]
*  There will certainly be some who criticize the administration for giving Vladimir Putin [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=737.2s)]
*  what he wants. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  Though three Americans are coming home safe, there are some who argue that this gives an [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=743.5600000000001s)]
*  incentive for Putin to continue to do this kind of thing. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=748.88s)]
*  That really is a question that is asked every time one of these deals are struck. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=753.0s)]
*  It's a valid question because there are no clear-cut answers here. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=758.96s)]
*  Because on one hand, you do incentivize this sort of behavior on the part of Russia, on [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=762.96s)]
*  the part of other American adversaries to take essentially hostages in order to secure [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=767.92s)]
*  the release of their own priorities or their own international agendas. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=774.24s)]
*  And that's a policy problem. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=780.96s)]
*  At the same time, there's a, we've heard this over multiple administrations, what they view [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=782.4s)]
*  as a moral obligation to try to secure the release of Americans. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=786.2800000000001s)]
*  And I think what we'll probably hear, assuming this deal does go all the way through today, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=790.6800000000001s)]
*  which very hopefully does, we'll hear more about that soon, essentially how this administration [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=795.32s)]
*  has had to weigh those complicated concerns. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=801.84s)]
*  These are moments where there's joy that you get these Americans back, but nobody's very [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=803.72s)]
*  happy about having to do this sort of arrangement. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=807.72s)]
*  It's a very tough policy trade-off. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=810.24s)]
*  Zeke Miller, White House correspondent for the Associated Press, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=814.04s)]
*  I want to turn now to William Pomeranz. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=817.64s)]
*  He's the senior fellow and former director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=820.68s)]
*  First off, thanks so much for joining us, William. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=825.04s)]
*  Give us a quick overview. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=827.08s)]
*  Where do U.S.-Russia relations stand right now? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=828.68s)]
*  Well, they are in a very difficult position. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=831.88s)]
*  It's very encouraging that some of these essentially hostages have been released, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=837.0s)]
*  but I don't see this as a real turn in U.S.-Russia relations. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=843.0s)]
*  How is a deal like this able to be negotiated when tensions are so high between these two countries? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=849.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, I think it is able to be negotiated because everyone gets something in this exchange. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=855.9599999999999s)]
*  We're still waiting to see all of the Americans and who they are coming home, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=864.52s)]
*  but I think that Russia, in the sense, wanted to make a deal. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=871.08s)]
*  This will be a propaganda coup for them because they have gotten some of their [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=876.4399999999999s)]
*  prisoners in the West to the Russian Federation, but I don't think this will have a significant [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=882.92s)]
*  impact on U.S.-Russian relations, especially since the war in Ukraine is ongoing. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=890.44s)]
*  William, can you give us a sense of how the Russian court system works? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=895.32s)]
*  Because we have heard from the U.S. government from the beginning [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=898.52s)]
*  that these Americans did nothing wrong, that they were political prisoners. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=901.32s)]
*  Can you give us a sense, a little information about the Russian court system, how it works? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=904.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, the court system is very much biased to the Russian state and the prosecutor's office, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=911.32s)]
*  and essentially there is no ability to have a defense for these defendants. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=918.52s)]
*  So it was a foregone conclusion that they would be convicted. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=924.84s)]
*  The only positive thing about the conviction is that once they were convicted, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=928.92s)]
*  the Russians would say they had a fair court system and that they basically indicted and [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=934.92s)]
*  convicted all the people. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=944.52s)]
*  A really powerful moment that we're watching live is the plane sits on the tarmac in Turkey, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=946.1999999999999s)]
*  carrying these three Americans home. William, if this deal didn't happen, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=950.4399999999999s)]
*  what were these Americans facing? What kind of conditions would they be enduring in a Russian prison? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=955.64s)]
*  They would be enduring very harsh conditions. In many cases, no access to families or Western [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=962.92s)]
*  media and so forth. They would be isolated. And it was just a traumatic position for all these [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=973.0s)]
*  Americans who, as you said, did nothing wrong, yet found themselves stuck inside the Russian prison [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=982.12s)]
*  penal system. Now we know that several Russian prisoners are being released as part of this [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=990.0400000000001s)]
*  exchange. Are there concerns about the concessions that the U.S. had to make in these cases? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=996.6800000000001s)]
*  WILLIAM BRANGHAM, The New York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1002.84s)]
*  We will have to wait and see who is traded in this swap. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1004.12s)]
*  Obviously, in the previous swap with Brittany Greiner, they swapped a major Russian, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1009.72s)]
*  basically war criminal and gun runner for Brittany Greiner. So we will have to wait and see as to who [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1018.12s)]
*  is exchanged. But I think that, in light of the terrible conditions that these Americans were [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1025.08s)]
*  placed under, I think that a deal will be a positive aspect for this event. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1032.84s)]
*  MICHAEL SCHERER, The New York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1041.72s)]
*  Will Russia and Putin view this as a win as well? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1042.4399999999998s)]
*  WILLIAM BRANGHAM, The New York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, The New [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1045.56s)]
*  York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, I'm sure he will. He always thinks everything is [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1046.9199999999998s)]
*  a win for him. And Russia has a tradition of no prisoners left behind. And so whoever Russia was [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1049.48s)]
*  able to exchange, I believe that there were some people who had been arrested in Slovakia. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1059.16s)]
*  But I think Putin will herald this as a win and an attempt to say that Russia was able to get [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1065.88s)]
*  its prisoners and that it made no concessions to the West. Indeed, everyone who was exchanged from [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1075.24s)]
*  the American side had already been convicted. MICHAEL SCHERER, The New York Times, The New [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1083.16s)]
*  York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, I want to bring in Olivia Gazis. Olivia, I want to [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1086.92s)]
*  talk about, we have been here before. We have been here with Brittany Greiner. We have been here with [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1089.72s)]
*  Trevor Reed. And now we're here with Evan Gurskiewicz and Paul Whelan and also Kerma Shema. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1093.64s)]
*  Are we going to be back here again? Is Putin going to continue to do this? And is there any sort of [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1099.88s)]
*  warning that the U.S. government puts out for Americans that this could happen to them if they [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1105.88s)]
*  travel to Russia? VIVIEN SCHUMAN, The New York Times, The New York Times, I think, Michael, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1112.3600000000001s)]
*  as you have been discussing, there is clearly a benefit that the Russians can see to opportunistically [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1114.6000000000001s)]
*  taking Americans on its soil and accusing them of something, either legitimately or not, in order [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1120.8400000000001s)]
*  to leverage their eventual release. We have seen it happen time and again. And that is why, when [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1126.68s)]
*  these cases arise, and this is not to blame the people who go there, but the State Department does [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1132.36s)]
*  stress Russia has a travel advisory in place. It is a level four. That is the highest level [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1138.1999999999998s)]
*  advisory against traveling into the country, precisely because of the dangers that Americans [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1144.76s)]
*  could face if they step foot on a very aggressive adversary's soil. So they try to remind Americans, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1150.1999999999998s)]
*  you are not welcome there, you are at risk of being arbitrarily detained there, you are at risk [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1160.76s)]
*  of being imprisoned there. Do not travel. That is hard, of course. There is a robust Russian-American [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1166.36s)]
*  community in the United States. There's plenty of reasons to want to travel for Russia, for reporting, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1172.44s)]
*  for business, for family relations. So not everybody heeds that warning. But it is a fact that the U.S. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1176.44s)]
*  government stresses it is dangerous to go there. Do not go. And that's why that travel advisory is [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1183.16s)]
*  in existence. I also want to ask about what's taking place right now. Again, we're still awaiting [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1188.44s)]
*  the details of this deal, but I have to imagine there are many government agencies involved [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1194.68s)]
*  in the transport of these Americans back home. Absolutely. We do know from previous cases that [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1199.8s)]
*  this ends up being a whole of government undertaking. It's the White House, it's the [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1206.44s)]
*  State Department, it's the CIA. Think about all of the logistics that need to be involved in [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1210.6000000000001s)]
*  coordinating families, in determining where is a sort of neutral territory for the swap to take [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1215.72s)]
*  place, coordinating planes to get there, negotiating with prisons, dealing with justice departments. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1222.76s)]
*  You can see why it is one of the most complex undertakings and politically fraught undertakings [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1228.92s)]
*  that governments can engage in. The pictures, I assume, show that there are multiple planes [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1234.44s)]
*  on the tarmac. We do know this deal is historically complex in how it was constructed. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1241.24s)]
*  And we do know that it was a months-long endeavor, and in the case of Paul Wheeler, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1246.92s)]
*  a years-long endeavor by the U.S. government to deal with the Russians, to find the key that would [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1251.72s)]
*  unlock a deal in order to secure the release of the Americans who had been deemed wrongfully [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1257.0s)]
*  detained and that the U.S. wanted to have back. What was the interest for the U.S. in getting these [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1263.08s)]
*  prisoners home safe, and what international concerns arise when Americans are imprisoned [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1267.8s)]
*  abroad? Well, I mean, the safety of American citizens, you will hear the U.S. government say, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1272.6s)]
*  is its paramount interest, right? The U.S. is going to protect whoever it is, wherever it is, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1278.28s)]
*  is going to endeavor to bring them home to safety and to their families, especially in cases where [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1285.1599999999999s)]
*  these people are arbitrarily detained by a hostile foreign government. We know that Russia is not the [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1289.8s)]
*  only one who does this. There are dozens of other Americans being held overseas in places like China, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1295.64s)]
*  Venezuela, Iran. And in every case, there is an intensive process that the U.S. government [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1301.48s)]
*  undertakes in order to determine whether these individuals can be released. It becomes more [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1307.16s)]
*  fraught when they have dual citizenship. As we've been discussing, some of the prisoners [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1312.68s)]
*  that Russia has taken have dual American and Russian citizenship, in which case the Russians [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1318.2s)]
*  can claim we are treating this person as a Russian and not as an American citizen. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1323.16s)]
*  China has done so as well. When there have been joint Chinese and American citizens detained on [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1328.44s)]
*  Chinese soil, the Chinese will say we are detaining one of our own citizens, and therefore we do not [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1333.48s)]
*  even have to offer consular access to you. And so that is why this process that we've been talking [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1339.0s)]
*  about of designating somebody wrongfully detained is laborious, requires a lot of lawyers and [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1345.88s)]
*  investigation and dealing with a foreign government in order to say there is actually [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1352.28s)]
*  no there there and we need the citizen back. I want to turn now to AP White House correspondent [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1357.08s)]
*  Zeke Miller. Zeke, I want to talk about the vice president. I imagine that she will also be at the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1362.36s)]
*  White House when these Americans arrive home, but how significant is this for her campaign? Will this [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1368.92s)]
*  be something that we see her bring up as she runs for the White House? Yeah, we see [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1375.56s)]
*  currently in Houston this morning to attend a memorial service for Jackson Lee, but her schedule [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1382.52s)]
*  has her returning to Washington, so presumably she'd want to be involved in whatever sort of [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1388.04s)]
*  welcome there is here back in the United States. She's a member of the Biden administration and she [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1394.28s)]
*  is running on the Biden-Harris administration record, and this isn't about to be yet another [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1404.28s)]
*  policy success that she would be able to point to. I think it's certainly safe to say she's going to [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1410.36s)]
*  talk about that in the days and weeks ahead. At the same time, this is not one of those issues [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1419.9599999999998s)]
*  that moves a ton of votes, but it's a sort of thing that can help show competence and [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1427.7199999999998s)]
*  the capability to lead the country that she will try to associate herself with as she tries in the [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1433.56s)]
*  next 96 days to make her case to the American people that she should be in the Oval Office. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1442.28s)]
*  William Pomerantz, senior fellow and former director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1447.1599999999999s)]
*  we were talking about U.S.-Russia relations, and one thing that strikes me is that [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1451.08s)]
*  the Putin administration has been indelibly tied to American politics over the last few years, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1455.56s)]
*  and there is a perception that Putin certainly favors former President Trump winning the White [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1465.32s)]
*  House again. Is it surprising at all that Putin was willing to release these Americans under the [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1471.1599999999999s)]
*  Biden administration? Yes, I think that is surprising in a variety of ways, but I think [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1476.28s)]
*  obviously Russia wanted to make this deal as well. I think it helps Putin's position. I think he [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1485.6399999999999s)]
*  would have wanted to wait a little while and maybe get some glory to former President Trump, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1493.32s)]
*  but I think the pressure, essentially, on world opinion to get some of these people released [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1502.8400000000001s)]
*  was a drag on Russia. Again, not that they don't have other problems, serious problems as well, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1511.0800000000002s)]
*  but now this one problem is off the table. What is the role of Turkey as sort of the stopping point [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1517.88s)]
*  for this prisoner swap? I think Turkey has tried to play an intermediary role throughout this war [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1527.56s)]
*  in Ukraine, between Russia and Ukraine, and so Turkey will gain some prestige by being able to [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1536.52s)]
*  pull off this prisoner swap, and I think Erdogan will use this to try to promote Turkey as an [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1547.08s)]
*  intermediary for some sort of peace deal. I don't know if Erdogan really has the respect [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1555.4s)]
*  of the Ukrainians to do that, but I think he will try to use it as establishing Turkey as the [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1564.2s)]
*  peacemaker, and there are lots of attempts to have peace negotiations, and I think this will [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1573.88s)]
*  basically help Erdogan and Turkey to play that role. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP031PM1TAM&t=1580.52s)]
