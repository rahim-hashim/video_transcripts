# Biden energy coordinator says Gulf states have "more room" to boost oil supply
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o)
*  As President Biden met with Middle Eastern leaders last week, he was accompanied by Amos [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=0.0s)]
*  Hoxtein, the special presidential coordinator for International Energy Affairs. He's with us now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=4.4s)]
*  Mr. Hoxtein, welcome to Face the Nation. Good to have you here in person. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=9.6s)]
*  It's great to be here in person. Thank you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=12.4s)]
*  So you were one of the few U.S. officials in the room when President Biden met with [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=14.32s)]
*  Saudi leaders. Why was this trip worth the political risk? What did you get? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=19.28s)]
*  Well, I think this was a historic trip. First, it started just landing in Saudi Arabia in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Jeddah as the first ever flight for a president to fly from Israel directly to Saudi Arabia, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=29.04s)]
*  with the backdrop of Saudi Arabia opening the, announcing that they're opening the skies for [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=35.2s)]
*  the first time for Israeli aircraft, for all aircraft, including flights to and from Israel [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=39.92s)]
*  over its airspace. Comes on the backdrop of a major achievement over the last few months of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=44.4s)]
*  a ceasefire in Yemen, where thousands of people have been killed over the last seven years. This [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=50.56s)]
*  has been the longest ceasefire we've had, with a commitment from Saudi Arabia to work to extend [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=56.72s)]
*  the ceasefire even further. Major announcements for food security and achieving contributions from [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=62.96s)]
*  the GCC, from the Gulf countries on food security. But none on oil yet. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=70.96s)]
*  Well, we had major announcements on cooperation on energy writ large. And if you recall, just before [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=75.28s)]
*  the president announced his trip, just a few days before that, OPEC Plus made a major shift in its [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=82.08s)]
*  policies, recognizing that since Putin started amassing forces, the markets have been affected, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=87.52s)]
*  and that there was a supply demand issue, and announced increases in supply of 50% [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=93.36s)]
*  for July and August. And based on what we heard on the trip, I'm pretty confident that we'll [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=97.92s)]
*  see a few more steps in the coming weeks. So OPEC Plus meets August 3rd. Saudi has some, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=103.36s)]
*  very little spare capacity. So are you saying you got to wink and a nod that they're going to pump [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=111.44s)]
*  more? I think what we discussed, first of all, it's not just about Saudi. It's about we met with [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=115.76s)]
*  with the GCC and with Saudi Arabia. There is, I'm not going to go into how much spare capacity there [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=120.48s)]
*  is in Saudi Arabia and in UAE and Kuwait, etc. But there is additional spare capacity. There is room [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  for increased production. As we've told producers in the United States, we've had conversations [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  over the last several months and weeks with OPEC. And I believe that there is still more room to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=137.76s)]
*  see additional steps. Saudi says it's got like a million spare barrel capacity. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=144.32s)]
*  Again, it's not just about Saudi. This is OPEC. So there are other countries as well. So what we [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  need is to see a little bit more. But let's look at what has happened since the president announced [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  his trip. Oil prices at that point were at about 120. Today oil prices are around 100, 101 dollars. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=157.92s)]
*  So that's a 20 dollar decline based on the steps. Some of that due to economic concerns, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=164.08s)]
*  though. China looking like it's slowing and concerns here about consumption going down. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  So there's no doubt there's never one reason why oil prices go up or why oil goes down. As you know, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=173.68s)]
*  when oil prices go up, they tend to say there's only one reason. That's the political leadership. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=178.96s)]
*  But if you think about it this way, over the last few months, the president has [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=183.68s)]
*  supplied the U.S. market with a million barrels a day, which is a historic level. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=188.56s)]
*  From the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We've never done that before. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=191.92s)]
*  And that ends in September? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  No, that will end towards the end of the year. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  Will it end towards the end of the year? Can you afford to stop putting emergency supply on the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=200.0s)]
*  market? Well, look at what has happened. The private sector, as we talked to them in the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=204.48s)]
*  United States, said they can increase production in the United States by about a million barrels a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=209.6s)]
*  day, but it's going to take time to invest in it. It'll come at the end of the year. So we stepped [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=213.6s)]
*  in. The president stepped in and said, I'll fill that gap. So hopefully my expectation is that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=217.68s)]
*  the private sector in the U.S. will have those increases coming so we don't need to have [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=223.6s)]
*  the emergency from the U.S. government. In the meantime, we've seen the prices, both the oil [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=228.48s)]
*  price, but also the price of the pump has come down at the fastest rate that we have seen in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=234.4s)]
*  over a decade. So from over $5. And remember this, just a few weeks ago. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=238.56s)]
*  It's still pretty high. $5, still pretty high. It may have come down. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=243.2s)]
*  It's not $5 anymore. It's now $4.55 and I expect it to come down more towards $4. And we already [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=245.04s)]
*  have many gas stations around the country that are below $4. So this is the fastest decline rate [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  that we've seen against a major increase of oil prices during a war in Europe, where one of the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=258.24s)]
*  parties in the war is the third largest producer in the world. So these are extraordinary circumstances. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=264.88s)]
*  We've taken very tough measures to address them right away, both for the American consumer, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=270.56s)]
*  really for global economy too. Well, we'll watch to see if those gas prices continue to fall. I [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=275.44s)]
*  want to ask you about what the administration is pushing around the world, which is this concept [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=280.96s)]
*  of putting a cap on the price of Russian oil that is sold so that it's not cutting back on the amount, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=285.52s)]
*  but rather the windfall profits Putin can profit off of it. What's to stop Vladimir Putin from just [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=292.24s)]
*  saying, fine, I'm just going to stop pumping? Well, I think that the way, look, the price cap. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=299.28s)]
*  Does that ruin your plan if he does that? Well, first, he could do that tomorrow, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=304.32s)]
*  regardless of what we do on a price cap. You know, Putin has been an unreliable supplier, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  unfortunately. But I think what we're doing is we're designing the mechanism so that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  he can still, he still would have revenues. He needs those revenues to, that's the only revenues [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  he really has in his country. There's nothing else in Russia except for oil and gas. Well, JP Morgan [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  says he's got enough cash that he's sitting on that he could cut by five million barrels in that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=327.44s)]
*  extreme example that the price of oil would go up to over $300 a barrel, almost $400 a barrel. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=332.24s)]
*  Well, what we want to be able to do is to mitigate where the price of oil on the world market doesn't [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=337.76s)]
*  actually impact Russia at all, because we're going to put a price cap so that all they have [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=343.52s)]
*  is to get that price and no more than that. We believe that that is the way to do it. So if [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=348.88s)]
*  prices go up, he still won't get that price and we can reduce that price. Do you have buy-ins for that [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=353.2s)]
*  yet? Why would India or China comply? Well, first, at the G7 a couple of weeks ago, the G7 [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=356.48s)]
*  endorsed this idea as a good idea. We're now starting to have the conversations with the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=363.12s)]
*  major consumers. And I would ask the question the other way around. Doesn't every buyer try to get [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=367.12s)]
*  a lower price? So I think every buyer is incentivized to pay less. And I'll go a step further. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  Right now, regardless of what you see as the global oil price, that's not what Putin's getting. So [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=378.8s)]
*  these headlines about Putin getting some kind of a math between how much is he selling times the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=383.76s)]
*  price of oil in the world, that's not his revenue because he's already agreed to major discounts. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=390.4s)]
*  But he's still taking in money and he's still funding this war. That's what we're trying to stop. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=395.12s)]
*  Right. But in the meantime, I want to ask you quickly about the president's climate change [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=398.56s)]
*  efforts. This bill and his proposal is completely stalled right now. The president says he's going [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=404.48s)]
*  to take executive action. What is the plan? What are you going to actually do here in the United [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=409.28s)]
*  States? Well, I think we've tried to get a plan where we can incentivize, create incentives for [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=413.44s)]
*  US investment. You can't block new oil and gas drilling, right? You can't do some of those things [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=420.56s)]
*  because they would counter your efforts. Well, I think what we want to do in this bill that we [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  have proposed, and we are hopeful that we still hope that that's what Congress does, is to give [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=429.28s)]
*  the kind of incentive assurances that we can have additional American investment in climate, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=434.08s)]
*  renewable energy, electric vehicles. Why wouldn't we want to do that? Why would we want to make, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=441.2s)]
*  to create an environment in which China is ahead of us, the rest of the world is making the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=445.76s)]
*  investments and we're not? We want to be able to put the kind of incentives that there'll be [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=450.47999999999996s)]
*  additional investment in the infrastructure for renewable energy, for solar, for wind and for [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=454.96s)]
*  electric vehicles and for a nuclear fleet in this country. That's how we get to climate. We didn't [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  get that today. The president is determined to take some action that he can through executive [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=465.44s)]
*  orders and through other actions. We'll see what we can do this week and in the coming weeks. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=470.64s)]
*  But again, I think that the responsibility here is to be able to invest into our future, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=476.56s)]
*  whether we like it or not. Those some don't like it. This is the future of energy markets [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=481.68s)]
*  in the United States and around the world. We got to decide. Do we want the US to lead? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=487.12s)]
*  Right. Or do we want the Chinese to lead this? You got to convince Senator Joe Manchin. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  We'll be talking about that ahead in this segment. Thank you very much for coming in. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=495.2s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG1gXjf8G8o&t=499.28s)]
