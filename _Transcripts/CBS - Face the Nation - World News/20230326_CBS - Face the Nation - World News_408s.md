# Warner says White House supports his bill targeting TikTok
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [March 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8)
*  We go now to Senator Mark Warner, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us from King George, Virginia. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=4.54s)]
*  Good morning to you, Senator. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=6.58s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=7.58s)]
*  It was a pretty intense five hours of questioning of TikTok's CEO this past week. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=9.48s)]
*  Your bipartisan bill has White House support, and it would deal with TikTok by giving the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=15.74s)]
*  Commerce Department power to review and potentially ban technology flagged by U.S. intelligence [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=20.8s)]
*  as a credible threat. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=27.38s)]
*  Will it pass in a divided Congress? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=29.14s)]
*  We're now up to 22 senators, 11 Democrats, 11 Republicans. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=31.380000000000003s)]
*  We've had strong interest from the House. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=35.9s)]
*  I think they wanted to get through their hearing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=37.82s)]
*  And clearly, while I appreciated Mr. Hsu's testimony, he just couldn't answer the basic [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  question. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=46.1s)]
*  At the end of the day, TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance, and by Chinese [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=47.1s)]
*  law, that company has to be willing to turn over data to the Communist Party or, in one [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  of my bigger fears, we've got 150 million Americans on TikTok, average of about 90 [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=58.92s)]
*  minutes a day, and how that channel could be used for propaganda purposes or mis or [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=63.96s)]
*  disinformation advocated by the Communist Party. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=69.72s)]
*  But has the White House made clear to you that they want this bill to pass and do intend [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=73.04s)]
*  to ban it, or is a forced sale more likely? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=77.58s)]
*  Well, I think the White House is very in favor of this bill. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  We give the Secretary of Commerce the tools to ban, to force a sale, other tools, and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=85.52s)]
*  end of the day, one of the things that may lead to a ban is the Chinese Communist Party [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=92.36s)]
*  has said they felt like the algorithm, the source code that resides in Beijing is so [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  important that they'd rather see a ban than give that source code up to be placed in a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=103.34s)]
*  third country, which again, I think speaks volumes about the potential threat that this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=108.25999999999999s)]
*  application poses. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=113.24s)]
*  Well, the Commerce Secretary, though, recently said that the politician in her thinks a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=114.8s)]
*  ban will mean losing every voter under 35 forever. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=119.58s)]
*  And if you look at use of TikTok, I mean, just last week, President Biden showed up [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  in celebrity videos on TikTok from the White House. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=127.34s)]
*  Plenty of lawmakers, including your Democratic colleague, Senator Cory Booker, uses it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=132.2s)]
*  A number of House progressives use it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=137.28s)]
*  Given how important this platform is to Democrats, can you actually get TikTok taken care of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=140.44s)]
*  before 2024 when you might need it for political outreach? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=146.32s)]
*  Well, Margaret, I think there's a lot of creative activity that goes on on TikTok. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=149.84s)]
*  But I absolutely believe that the market, if TikTok goes away, the market will provide [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=154.54s)]
*  another platform. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=160.56s)]
*  And at the end of the day, that could be an American company, could be a Brazilian company, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=161.56s)]
*  could be an Indian company. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=165.32s)]
*  But the Commerce Secretary is saying there's a political cost if it goes away. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=168.04s)]
*  And that's what she fears. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=172.0s)]
*  I think, listen, I have met with Gina Raimondo on this issue. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=173.0s)]
*  I think she will make very clear that she believes TikTok is a threat as well. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=178.6s)]
*  And listen, if at the end of the day, you could end up with a forced sale and that forced [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=183.88s)]
*  sale also makes sure that the core algorithm, the source code resides someplace different [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=188.44s)]
*  than China, that could be a outcome that would be successful as well. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=195.3s)]
*  But end of the day, you cannot have American data collected, nor can you have the ability [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=199.86s)]
*  for the Communist Party to use TikTok as a propaganda tool. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=205.10000000000002s)]
*  60 percent of the company is owned by other investors, including U.S. firms. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  So is this a policy that you really need to address with Americans to stop them from investing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  in companies like this? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=218.5s)]
*  Well, that's one of the reasons why I think our approach, the Restrict Act, says rather [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  than dealing with TikTok in a one-off fashion, or a few years back it was Wall-Way, the Chinese [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=224.7s)]
*  telecom provider, or years earlier, the Russian software company Kaspersky, we need to have [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=229.94s)]
*  a set of tools, rules-based, so they can stand up in court. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=236.42s)]
*  TikTok would still get its day in court, even under our law, that says if there's a foreign [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=240.42s)]
*  technology from a place like China and Russia and it poses a national security threat. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=246.22s)]
*  And one of the things we also require is that the intelligence community has to declassify [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  as much of this information as possible. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=255.82s)]
*  So it's not simply like, hey, trust the government. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=258.36s)]
*  We got to make the case. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=260.98s)]
*  I want to ask you, since you sit on the Senate Banking Committee about this rolling turmoil [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=261.98s)]
*  that we are in, do you think there needs to be more regulation of mid-sized banks now? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=266.54s)]
*  If it ends up that a stress test that would have been applied to these mid-sized banks [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=272.38s)]
*  would have spotted this, of course I'd add additional regulation. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=277.86s)]
*  I think, though, what appears to me is two things happened. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=280.9s)]
*  One, basic banking regulation, if this has been only a $5 billion bank, not a $200 billion [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=284.38s)]
*  bank, should have spotted the fact that this management and the regulators missed basic [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=290.29999999999995s)]
*  banking 101, the interest rate mismatch. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=295.62s)]
*  And two, one of the things I think we also have to look at is this was the first time [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=298.9s)]
*  we've had an internet-based run. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=302.85999999999996s)]
*  There was literally $42 billion taken out of this bank in six hours. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=305.08s)]
*  That's the equivalent of 25 cents on the dollar. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=310.58s)]
*  And I'd like to know why some of the venture capitalists spurred this run in the first [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=313.02s)]
*  place. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=317.18s)]
*  Interesting topic. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=319.78s)]
*  I want to ask you, though, as well about your relationship with SVB Bank and political donations. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=320.78s)]
*  You received $21,600 from their political action committee, nearly $6,000 from its CEO. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=328.06s)]
*  Do you feel any pressure to give those funds away? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=334.62s)]
*  Is there a point to it? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=337.02s)]
*  We're going to hear the facts on Tuesday. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=339.1s)]
*  And if there's malfeasance at the bank, of course I'm going to give the money back. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=340.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=344.18s)]
*  Senator, before I let you go, I want to just follow up on what you shared with us when [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=345.18s)]
*  we spoke back in January when you were very frustrated that the administration wasn't [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  sharing more information about the classified materials improperly held by the current president [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=353.6s)]
*  when he was out of office and the former president. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  You've been briefed. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=363.34000000000003s)]
*  Any more clarity on this? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=364.56s)]
*  Any further information? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=366.1s)]
*  We need more information about these documents. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=368.4s)]
*  And more importantly, we need to make sure that what the intel community has done to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  mitigate the harm. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=377.08s)]
*  And we're still in conversations with the Justice Department. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=379.41999999999996s)]
*  The administration's position does not pass the smell test. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=382.9s)]
*  We've got a job not to go into the legal ramifications, but to make sure that the intelligence community [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=388.08s)]
*  has done what's right. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=393.4s)]
*  And we've got some additional tools. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=395.0s)]
*  We can restrict some of the spending. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=397.36s)]
*  We're inactive conversations with the Justice Department, but we've got to get those documents. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=399.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=404.32s)]
*  Senator Warner, thank you for your time today. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEbLWVP6Vd8&t=405.32s)]
