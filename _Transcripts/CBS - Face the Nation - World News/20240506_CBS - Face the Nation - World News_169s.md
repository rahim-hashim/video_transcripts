*  Elaine talk to us more about what the presidents of China and France are seeking to accomplish through this visit [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  With this visit marks 60 years of official relations between France and China, but it's not [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=30.0s)]
*  ceremonial not just [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=36.56s)]
*  top of macrons list today is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=38.36s)]
*  Ukraine because he believes that President Xi because of his close ties with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=41.8s)]
*  Russian leader Vladimir Putin could help to restore peace and stability in the region and in fact ahead of this visit [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=46.44s)]
*  President Xi said he was willing to work with France and the international community to find what he called the right path [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=54.8s)]
*  To solve the crisis now next on the list is business because in post-covid times [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=61.76s)]
*  France is hoping to beef up the contracts it has there French companies will be hoping to renegotiate new ones and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=68.2s)]
*  Renew old ones and China is looking of course to sell some of its surplus production for example electric cars to France [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=75.76s)]
*  So this is the first time we're seeing Xi Jinping go to Europe since the pandemic and I thought to myself [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=83.8s)]
*  You know part of the messaging here. I'm sure is hey Russia. I have other friends. Hey America. I have other friends [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=89.44s)]
*  Why is this trip in Europe being so closely watched by officials in Washington? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=97.16s)]
*  We are expecting president Xi to try to persuade president Macron to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=104.6s)]
*  Pull back a bit from the US and that's part of his aim at [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=109.76s)]
*  loosening the US grip on [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=114.72s)]
*  Global dominance China very much likes to see itself as a major player now France [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=117.0s)]
*  Recently said that it has no desire to be a vassal to the US [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  But my crop also very strongly saying the US is a strong ally of both France and Europe [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  There's also the issue of course of Ukraine this visit to France comes just over a week after [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=135.08s)]
*  Secretary of State Blinken was in China where he warned and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=141.8s)]
*  President Xi against supplying the goods that can help to build up munitions used by Russia in Ukraine and President Macron [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=146.12s)]
*  repeated that more as a request and an encouragement because of course France doesn't have the same clout [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=155.44s)]
*  But just to show that they are indeed both on the same page [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  Alright Elaine, thank you very much [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnkG8UuqIAM&t=167.48s)]
