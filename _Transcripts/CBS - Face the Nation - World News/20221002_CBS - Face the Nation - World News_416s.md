# McMaster says Russian army in Ukraine is facing a "moral collapse"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0)
*  the Trump administration national security advisor in 2017, retired lieutenant general [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=0.0s)]
*  H.R. McMaster, who joins us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=6.78s)]
*  H.R., thank you for updating us on what's happening on the ground in Ukraine with the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=9.26s)]
*  Russian invasion. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=15.72s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to what Defense Secretary Austin called a significant development [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=16.88s)]
*  on the battlefield in the past 48 hours. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=23.28s)]
*  What do you see happening? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=27.28s)]
*  What do you forecast as Vladimir Putin's next move? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=28.76s)]
*  Hey, good morning, Margaret. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=33.52s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=34.28s)]
*  Well, this is a tremendous victory for for the Ukrainians, and it's a victory that I [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  think that they could turn into a cascading series of defeats of Russian forces. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=40.24s)]
*  This is the the encirclement of Lyman and the and the Russian forces pulling back. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  But also in the last two days, the Ukrainians also simultaneously defeated a Russian a Russian [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  counterattack and also made progress further in the south near the strategically important [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=57.44s)]
*  city of Kursan. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=62.48s)]
*  And I think, Margaret, what we might be here is really at the precipice of of really the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  collapse of the Russian army in Ukraine, a moral collapse. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=69.08s)]
*  And I think they must really be at a breaking point if you look at just the numbers of casualties, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=74.1s)]
*  the vast area that they're trying to defend. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=80.2s)]
*  And now, of course, Russia is trying to mobilize conscripts and send them to the front untrained. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=83.44s)]
*  And I think it's very important to to also understand that these forces that are in full [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=90.72s)]
*  retreat now out of Lyman were really the first round of mobilization. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=95.32s)]
*  Remember when Putin was trying to recruit more and more people with paying about three [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=100.32s)]
*  times the average wages to get so-called volunteers to go forward. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Those forces were hastily trained, thrown into that front. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=109.8s)]
*  And these are the forces that are collapsing just right right now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=112.8s)]
*  Well, and as that happens on the battlefield, rhetorically, you hear President Putin raise [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=116.08s)]
*  the volume again, dangling that nuclear threat on Friday. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=123.16s)]
*  And there was another Russian leader who talked about using low yield nuclear weapons. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=127.72s)]
*  It's not clear what NATO or the U.S. response would be if Russia used a nuclear tactical [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=132.88s)]
*  weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=139.0s)]
*  What do you think it should be? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=141.64s)]
*  Well, I think the message to him is if you use a nuclear weapon, it's a suicide weapon. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=142.64s)]
*  And the response from NATO and the United States doesn't have to be nuclear. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=148.8s)]
*  First of all, I would say, Margaret, he's under extreme pressure. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=153.08s)]
*  I mean, you you have the failures on the battlefield, which we talked about, but also the mobilization [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=155.68s)]
*  is failing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=160.8s)]
*  I mean, what he's done is he's mobilized almost 300,000 people to leave the country. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=161.8s)]
*  These are these are men who were fleeing to neighboring countries to to escape this this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=166.6s)]
*  conscription. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=171.08s)]
*  And you have the Russian people now saying, OK, I thought this was a special military [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=172.36s)]
*  operation that Putin said, hey, just leave this to me. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=176.32s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=179.08s)]
*  Now he's going to them to bail him out with this with this mobilization. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=180.08s)]
*  And what you're seeing among the hyper nationalist group of bloggers and and even on state media [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=184.2s)]
*  is a blaming of the military. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=190.9s)]
*  And what the military is going back to Putin is saying, hey, it's not our fault. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=192.4s)]
*  So it's the cycle that he's responding to with the only quiver he has left, which is [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=196.28s)]
*  to to to to to threaten the use of a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=201.44s)]
*  I'll tell you, Margaret, I don't think a nuclear weapon is usable there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=206.12s)]
*  So I think that we ought to take it seriously. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=209.44s)]
*  We have to. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=211.36s)]
*  But we ought to not allow this to cow us in terms of the support for the Ukrainians. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=212.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=217.56s)]
*  Well, the other weapon he has is energy, of course, and tracking this potential sabotage [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=218.56s)]
*  on the gas pipeline. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=224.58s)]
*  I want to also ask you about when you were in office back in 2017, which is the first [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=226.46s)]
*  time that the U.S. gave us offensive weapons to Ukraine. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=231.18s)]
*  I remember when you were put in that position of having to explain a conversation then President [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=237.22s)]
*  Trump had with Russian officials in the Oval Office where he mentioned classified information [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  and you you called it wholly appropriate at the time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=249.9s)]
*  Given what's going on now, this investigation into the classified material at Mar-a-Lago, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=253.85999999999999s)]
*  were you ever uncomfortable with the former president's handling of classified information? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=258.74s)]
*  Well, remember, I left in February, March of 2018. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=263.86s)]
*  But while I was there, I did not see any problems in handling of classified information. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=269.34s)]
*  And what you're talking about really is a session in which the president did not disclose [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=274.62s)]
*  classified information, but somebody leaked it and then it was published in a newspaper. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=278.74s)]
*  The classified information. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=284.22s)]
*  I think what is important is to go back to that period and that provision of javelins, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  of the defensive capabilities to the Ukrainians was really important. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=291.58000000000004s)]
*  And the argument I made to President Trump at the time was, hey, these people who tell [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=294.18s)]
*  you that it's provocative to provide Ukraine with defensive capabilities, actually what [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=298.3s)]
*  provokes Putin is weakness. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=303.14s)]
*  And he was persuaded by that argument. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=305.86s)]
*  And I think that argument is still relevant today. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=307.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, as Putin is encountering these difficulties, I think it's now time to remove some of the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=310.58000000000004s)]
*  restrictions that we've put on ourselves in terms of the support to give the Ukrainians. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=315.86s)]
*  And I'm talking about really long range surveillance capabilities tied to long range precision [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=319.58000000000004s)]
*  strike. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=324.42s)]
*  And that's really what they need, I think, to maintain the momentum militarily at this [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=325.42s)]
*  stage. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=329.38s)]
*  I have a follow up question on that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=330.38s)]
*  But just to button up the question I asked you, that was a no. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=331.38s)]
*  You were never uncomfortable with the handling of classified information. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=333.74s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=338.62s)]
*  Margaret, there were systems in place. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=339.7s)]
*  I don't know what happened to those systems. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=341.02s)]
*  But I was never uncomfortable with it while I was there. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=344.06s)]
*  But that was a long time ago now. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=346.18s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=348.54s)]
*  I know when you're in office, you never like answering counterfactuals. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=349.54s)]
*  But you're not in office. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=353.46s)]
*  So was Vladimir Putin so committed to this invasion that he would have gone through with [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=355.46s)]
*  it no matter what? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=360.42s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=365.22s)]
*  Think about all the support that we've given now to the Ukrainians. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=366.5s)]
*  What if we had done that a few years ago? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=369.36s)]
*  I think Putin may have come to the conclusion, well, Ukraine cannot be subsumed at an acceptable [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=371.8s)]
*  cost. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=377.88s)]
*  And of course, he was wrong in all the assumptions that led to the invasion. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=378.88s)]
*  And he's been proven wrong by courageous Ukrainians who are defending their sovereignty. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=381.88s)]
*  But I think deterrence by denial for us was a failure. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, in many of the actions that we took in the months before the invasion almost, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=389.64s)]
*  I think, inadvertently greenlighted it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=395.12s)]
*  Pulling our forces out of the Black Sea, listing all the things we weren't going to do. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=396.8s)]
*  And I think the Biden administration has recovered from that very well. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=401.12s)]
*  But I think now is the time, Margaret, to lift restrictions on the support that we're [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=405.0s)]
*  giving Ukrainians so they can finish this fight on their terms. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=409.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=412.44s)]
*  H.R. McMaster, thank you very much. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcYvuPFGw0&t=413.44s)]
