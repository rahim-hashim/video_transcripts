**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0)
*  A series of Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 20 people in the past [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=0.0s)]
*  24 hours. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=5.5s)]
*  That includes attacks in and around the capital of Beirut, a move which the Biden administration [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=6.88s)]
*  has warned against. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=11.620000000000001s)]

*  Debra? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=16.36s)]
*  Israeli jets pounded southern Lebanon today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=17.36s)]
*  In Nabatea, Israel hit a municipal building which killed 16, including the city's mayor, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=20.44s)]
*  and wounded over 50. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=27.28s)]
*  And despite U.S. concern over Israel's bombing campaign in Beirut, there were a series of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=29.619999999999997s)]
*  strikes around the capital this morning. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=35.1s)]
*  This comes a day after Hezbollah vowed to strike deeper inside Israel. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=38.3s)]
*  The Israeli military says it is targeting Hezbollah's strongholds, but there have been [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=44.019999999999996s)]
*  over 2,000 casualties and nearly 11,000 wounded, many of them civilians. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=49.14s)]

*  of this large influx of injured patients. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=67.36s)]
*  And aid organizations are also struggling to cope with the sudden demand to provide [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=71.16s)]
*  food and shelter for around 1.2 million people who have fled their homes because of the war. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=76.36s)]
*  Some of them are staying with family or in schools and office blocks, but many displaced [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=84.36s)]
*  people have come here to Beirut and are simply pitching tents wherever they can. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=90.0s)]
*  Lindsay? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvYumu_GQ0&t=95.88s)]
