*  CBS News foreign correspondent Deborah Pata reports from Kyiv. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=22.8s)]
*  It's happening with lightning speed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=29.12s)]
*  Advancing Ukrainian troops in the northeast Kharkiv region are taking back lost territory. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=31.48s)]
*  Despite casualties along the way, the gains have been rapid and dramatic. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=37.96s)]
*  And it's taken everyone by surprise. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=43.2s)]
*  Ukraine kept the operation a tightly guarded secret. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=47.96s)]
*  For now, journalists have been banned from reporting from the front line. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  But across the region, the blue and yellow flag has been raised in towns and villages [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=57.4s)]
*  occupied for more than half a year. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=63.44s)]

*  of the invading forces. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=74.12s)]
*  In liberated Balaklia, jubilation and tears. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=76.96s)]
*  In the words, these residents have waited so long to hear, everything's going to be [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=82.64s)]
*  OK, says the soldier. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=88.16s)]
*  For six months we prayed you would save us, sobs this woman. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=91.76s)]
*  It's a humiliating defeat for Vladimir Putin's men, who have been forced to beat a hasty [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=98.28s)]
*  retreat. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=104.0s)]

*  troops in Donetsk. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=111.12s)]
*  Ukraine has been emboldened by the steady supply of Western military aid, but it needs [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=113.36s)]
*  more to keep the momentum going, says the mayor of the now occupied militipol Ivan Fedorov. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=118.76s)]
*  Right now, Russia still holds around a fifth of this country. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=135.92s)]
*  Nobody expects this to be over quickly, but Ukrainians are daring to hope today that the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=140.52s)]
*  war could be starting to swing their way. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=145.8s)]
*  These are the most significant battlefield successes since they crushed Russia's attempt [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=148.72s)]
*  to seize Kiev at the start of this nearly seven-month-long war. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=153.88s)]
*  Margaret? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zka49VfvY&t=158.20000000000002s)]
