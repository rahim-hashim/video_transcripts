# John Kirby says NSC has "national security concerns" about TikTok
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [March 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4)
*  Now with White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, good to have you here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=0.0s)]
*  A lot to talk to. I want to start right where Senator Warner left off. Does the White House [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=4.8s)]
*  want to share more information about these classified materials? He says it doesn't pass [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=9.52s)]
*  the smell test. We're fully cooperating with the Justice Department on this ongoing investigation, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=13.52s)]
*  Margaret. That's got to be the focus, making sure that we preserve that process. And so that's what [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=18.8s)]
*  we're doing. And, you know, of course, at the appropriate time and in an appropriate setting, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=23.68s)]
*  we certainly understand the desire by members of Congress to know more, to see more. But we've got [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=28.32s)]
*  to make sure that we are full cooperation with the Justice Department on this right now. As for what [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=34.0s)]
*  Senator Warner was laying out there and giving the White House the tools to make a call on TikTok, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=38.8s)]
*  this has been going on for years now. Yeah. The review of whether to allow it. If it's a national [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=44.32s)]
*  security threat, doesn't there need to be swift action rather than more debate? Well, there's an [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  ongoing, as you know, review by the Committee on Foreign Investment. Three years now. It's an [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=54.32s)]
*  ongoing review. It's an independent review. We want to respect that process. But look, in the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=58.64s)]
*  meantime, the president's already said we absolutely have national security concerns about that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=63.2s)]
*  application and he's banned it from government devices. We don't want to get ahead of this review. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=68.0s)]
*  We have endorsed the restrict act, pending legislation. We'd love to see that passed by [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=72.16s)]
*  the Congress so that the president can have additional tools and authorities. We showed [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  a video in that last segment of the president on TikTok from a video shot by a celebrity [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=80.96s)]
*  inside the White House. So for the 150 million Americans who still use this app, how do you say [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=86.08s)]
*  to them, sorry, we're going to take it away? It's not on government. It looks hypocritical. It's not [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=91.36s)]
*  on government devices. We do have legitimate national security concerns. We have legitimate [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=96.08s)]
*  national security concerns over TikTok. It's a useful political platform. I just would tell you [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=102.08s)]
*  that again, our concerns on the national security front are valid. We've banned it on all government [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=108.72s)]
*  devices. We've got to get through this CFIUS review to see what the outcome is there before [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=113.76s)]
*  we move ahead. In the meantime, again, the president welcomes congressional action on a [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=118.96s)]
*  restrict act. Well, we'll see when it moves and what the action will be, ban or for sale. Let's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=124.4s)]
*  take a break. I want to talk to you about Syria and Iran in a moment. We return to our conversation [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=132.24s)]
*  with National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. I want to ask you about what has been [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=137.84s)]
*  happening in Syria with these attacks on U.S. forces there. We had this deadly attack on Thursday [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=143.68s)]
*  by these Iran-aligned groups, a U.S. retaliation, and then three other known attacks on U.S. positions. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=150.88s)]
*  President Biden said he would act if U.S. troops were under fire. Is the U.S. going to retaliate? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=158.4s)]
*  We have acted with U.S. troops under fire. First of all, condolences are condolences to the family [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=165.12s)]
*  of the U.S. contractor, U.S. citizen who was killed. That's devastating news that no family [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  wants to ever get, and we certainly grieve with them, and we're obviously hoping for a speedy [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=175.84s)]
*  recovery for those who are still suffering from the wounds. But this was a serious attack by [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=181.04s)]
*  these militant groups, and the president retaliated swiftly and boldly, significantly, to deal with [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=186.4s)]
*  You're right. There were some follow-up response from these militant groups. Not a lot of damage [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  caused, although one service member was injured. So we're going to see where this goes, but the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=199.6s)]
*  president in Ottawa made it very clear that we're going to always act to defend our troops and our [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=204.64s)]
*  facilities. And here's what's not going to change, Margaret. The mission in ISIS is not going to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  change. We have under a thousand troops in Syria that are going after that network, which is, while [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=213.6s)]
*  greatly diminished, still viable and still critical. So we're going to stay at that task. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=218.0s)]
*  The president is committed to keeping those 900 or so troops in Syria? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=222.56s)]
*  Absolutely. The head of central command testified earlier in the week there have been 78 attacks by [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=225.84s)]
*  Iran-backed groups against Americans since 2021. That was before these recent strikes. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=231.28s)]
*  They don't appear to be deterred by these verbal threats or even the retaliation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=237.12s)]
*  That's why, again, the president acted so swiftly and boldly here in this particular case. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=242.32s)]
*  I certainly am not going to rule out the potential for additional U.S. action if the president [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=246.8s)]
*  deems it appropriate and necessary to continue to protect our troops and our facilities. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=251.44s)]
*  We're going to keep at that. And that message is sent loud and clear. Now, again, these Iran-backed [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=256.24s)]
*  militant groups, decisions that they're going to have to make, they need to know. And we demonstrated [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=261.6s)]
*  here this week that the United States will always act decisively to protect our people. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=266.48s)]
*  But to cause American fatality, did this Iranian-backed group know that parts of the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=271.12s)]
*  radar defense system were not fully operational at the time they carried out that drone attack? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=277.36s)]
*  We've seen no indication that they had that kind of knowledge. And in the past, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=282.16s)]
*  on some of these other attacks, I mean, they have used similar capabilities to go after our troops [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=287.76s)]
*  and our facilities there in Syria. So there's no indication that they would have had knowledge of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=292.88s)]
*  that. Vladimir Putin said yesterday that Russia struck a deal with Belarus to station tactical [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=296.72s)]
*  nuclear weapons on its territories by July 1st. And then by about April 3rd, he says they're [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=303.12s)]
*  transferring ballistic missile systems and beginning training. Is he serious? Is this just [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  more saber rattling? We're just going to have to watch and see where this one goes, Margaret. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=313.6s)]
*  We have not seen any indication that he's made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  around. We've in fact seen no indication that he has any intention to use nuclear weapons, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=324.16s)]
*  period, inside Ukraine. Obviously, we would agree that no nuclear war should be fought. No nuclear [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  war could be won. Clearly, that would cross a major threshold. I would also tell you that as we [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=334.48s)]
*  monitor this, and we monitor it every day, you have to with the rhetoric coming out of Moscow, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=340.24s)]
*  and rhetoric that's been coming out since the beginning of the war, that we've seen nothing [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=344.88s)]
*  that would cause us to change our own strategic deterrent posture. Why would he do this now? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  You'd have to ask Mr. Putin. I can't speak to that. I think in some of the Russian media reports, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  they linked it to claims that the United Kingdom was going to provide depleted uranium rounds. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=359.68s)]
*  There is no radioactive threat from depleted uranium rounds. They're common on the battlefield. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=364.8s)]
*  Even Russia uses similar rounds. So if that is in fact the justification, it's a stake through a [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  straw man. There's no radioactivity concerns with that. Here in the United States, Taiwan's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  president is scheduled to begin a visit later this week in New York and then next week out in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=380.88s)]
*  California. Republican lawmakers will visit with her. Has the White House asked Democrats not to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=385.76s)]
*  do so? There's been no request by the White House to Democrats not to meet with President Tsai. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=391.84s)]
*  Members of Congress have every right to manage their agenda and their meeting schedule as they [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=397.28s)]
*  seem fit. I think it's important to remember what this is. This is a transit. They're normal. She's [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=402.08s)]
*  done six before. It's a long transit. She's done six before. Tension with China has never been this [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=405.92s)]
*  high. Look, we understand that. The president has said clearly he believes it's important to [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=409.92s)]
*  keep the lines of communication with China open. He wants to have another conversation with President [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=416.24s)]
*  Xi. We'll move in that direction, but these transits are normal, particularly for this [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=420.0s)]
*  particular president. No date for that call with President Xi. Thank you so much for joining us [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  here. We'll be right back. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMMaDo7ml4&t=430.16s)]
