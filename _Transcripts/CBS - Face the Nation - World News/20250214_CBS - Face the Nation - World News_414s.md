# Vance accuses Europe of promoting censorship
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE)
*  Welcome back. Thanks for staying with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=0.0s)]
*  While addressing the Munich Security Conference, Vice President Vance, in sort of veiled language, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=2.0s)]
*  maybe not so veiled, accused European countries of exercising some manner of censorship. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=8.44s)]
*  It's an important point. Let's take a listen. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=14.36s)]
*  In Britain and across Europe, free speech, I fear, is in retreat. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=17.04s)]
*  So I come here today not just with an observation, but with an offer. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=22.66s)]
*  Just as the Biden administration seemed desperate to silence people for speaking their minds, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=27.56s)]
*  so the Trump administration will do precisely the opposite, and I hope that we can work [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=32.36s)]
*  together on that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=37.64s)]
*  I want to bring in our reporter panel. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=38.64s)]
*  Tom LoBianco is the founder and national politics reporter for 24 Sight News. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=41.16s)]
*  Stephanie Lai is White House correspondent for Bloomberg. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Stephanie joins us from Munich. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=48.68s)]
*  Tom is right here with me at the table. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=50.16s)]
*  Stephanie, I want to start with you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=51.56s)]
*  That reference to censorship. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  How did that land with the Europeans who were there to listen to the vice president? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=56.2s)]
*  Well, the room was packed, but it didn't seem like many of the applause lines in his speech [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=60.24s)]
*  garnered much response from the people in the audience. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  There were a couple of chuckles here and there, but for the most part, it seemed like the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  crowd was quite stiff when he was speaking. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=74.4s)]
*  Now part of that is because the speech was essentially Vice President JD Vance's chance [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=76.84s)]
*  to assail leaders at the Munich Security Conference in his address that really threatened to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=81.44s)]
*  inflame the growing rifts between the U.S. and Europe, and it really failed to quell [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=86.92s)]
*  the concerns among European allies that were already wrangled from President Donald Trump's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=91.24s)]
*  remarks earlier this week about the handling of the war in Ukraine and some of his comments [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=96.8s)]
*  on tariffs. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=101.84s)]
*  And Stephanie, as I read the speech and looked over it, it appeared that the vice president [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=102.84s)]
*  was saying, look, you have in these various European countries a rising sentiment among [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=107.48s)]
*  some of your people that are with hard right political instincts. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=113.16s)]
*  That's troublesome in Germany, it's possibly troublesome in other European countries. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  And what Vance was saying, if I heard it correctly, was you better keep these voters because if [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=121.7s)]
*  you continue to ignore or push them aside, they're going to grow stronger. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Is that the way the room heard it? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=131.76s)]
*  It does seem like that was how it was received. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=134.36s)]
*  And in fact, he also had a similar sentiment at the AI summit in Paris when he said that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=136.56s)]
*  AI technology had been used by some of our foreign allies and adversaries to censor political [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  views. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  And that was in line with what you had mentioned on this populist, this growing right wing [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  across the world. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think JD Vance's message was very much that if the U.S. is to get involved, you cannot [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=157.72s)]
*  be continuing to do this sort of thing with your AI technologies and in your policies. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=163.88000000000002s)]
*  Stand by, Stephanie. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  Tom, this is the vice president sort of giving right giving voice to a kind of free speech [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=172.68s)]
*  permissiveness. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=179.5s)]
*  All speech is good, even if it if not terrifies, rankles those, for example, in Germany who [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=180.5s)]
*  are concerned about the rise of what appeared to them to be far right sentiments. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=186.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=191.84s)]
*  Take it in context. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=193.08s)]
*  This comes before the German elections. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=194.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=196.24s)]
*  They were going to have it mirrors a lot of the language that Elon Musk has used. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=197.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=201.6s)]
*  And posted on X. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=202.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=203.6s)]
*  And if you look at it, you talk about free speech. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=204.6s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, certainly, you know, we appreciate more than anybody. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=212.36s)]
*  The First Amendment. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=213.36s)]
*  But in this universe where people are dialed into their phones constantly, where X is in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=214.76s)]
*  some ways become the official government platform and certainly in some cases, there's an incredible [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  amount of false news out there. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=226.08s)]
*  Whether whatever you term that, it's wrong. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=229.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=232.72s)]
*  Often promoted by one of the most powerful figures in the world right now, Elon Musk. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=234.36s)]
*  And Europeans are skeptical of that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=238.8s)]
*  They have different rules and regulations about what constitutes hate speech, damaging [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=241.08s)]
*  speech, disinformation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=246.12s)]
*  And even one of the things that the vice president talked about is, well, your efforts to control [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=248.12s)]
*  that or police that social media space more aggressively than we do are by definition [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=252.52s)]
*  censorship. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  That's not the way the Europeans view it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=260.52000000000004s)]
*  And it also comes as Germany has asked for data on how Elon Musk is amplifying the false [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=261.8s)]
*  information because they want to know this is he is the most powerful political force [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=269.24s)]
*  at the moment right now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=274.68s)]
*  And we also saw that Vance met with Alice Weidel, the head of the AFD party. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=276.96s)]
*  Extreme right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=283.08s)]
*  It has some neo-Nazi stuff in its past. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=284.08s)]
*  Whether or not that's still the case, it is very extreme right. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  How you interpret that is very important. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  And what Vance is saying, whether he means that he'd the populace or whether he's using [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=294.84s)]
*  it to amplify and help out the AFD. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  He'd or amplify. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  Stephanie, I want to play for you something that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=306.32s)]
*  Poland today that I'm certain also attracted quite a bit of attention on the continent. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=310.48s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=315.68s)]
*  The American troop levels on the continent are important. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=316.68s)]
*  What happens five or 10 or 15 years from now is part of a larger discussion that reflects [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=319.88s)]
*  the threat level, America's posture, our needs around the globe, but most significantly the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  capability of European countries to step up. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  And that's why our message is so stark to our European allies. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=335.5s)]
*  Now is the time to invest because you can't make an assumption that America's presence [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=339.54s)]
*  will last forever. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=345.22s)]
*  One thing definitely true about what the defense secretary said. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=347.62s)]
*  The message was stark. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=350.66s)]
*  True, Stephanie? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=351.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=352.86s)]
*  And this is something that we've been hearing from many members of Trump's administration, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=353.86s)]
*  not just the defense secretary, but also Vice President JD Vance in his remarks this week [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=358.14s)]
*  really emphasize the point that the U.S. is not going to be a partner that can just [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=362.9s)]
*  continue to prop up every single country's defense funds. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=367.53999999999996s)]
*  His main message in his bilateral meetings with many world leaders this week alone has [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=371.5s)]
*  been that Europe has to step up its security guarantees and spending. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=376.02s)]
*  And so I think this message is very clear in that immediately there is interest. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=381.46s)]
*  I think Trump had even said earlier this week that he would be open to more aid to Ukraine, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=386.38s)]
*  but that interest comes with the caveat that this isn't a guarantee forever. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=391.42s)]
*  Not a guarantee forever and probably an exchange for investment in rare earth minerals in Ukraine [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=397.3s)]
*  or other commodities there of interest to the Trump administration. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=402.5s)]
*  Tom LoBianco here at the desk. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=406.7s)]
*  Stephanie Lyon. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=407.9s)]
*  Munich, thank you very much. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=408.9s)]
*  Stand by later in the show. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=410.54s)]
*  We'll bring you back for more conversation. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlXzqOiGnE&t=412.1s)]
