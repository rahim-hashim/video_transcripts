# Dozens injured after car ramming in Munich; Hegseth rules out NATO membership for Ukraine
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI)
*  Police in Munich have arrested a suspect accused of driving into a union demonstration injuring dozens of people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=0.0s)]
*  The suspected attack happened just hours before Vice President JD Vance arrived in Munich to discuss the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=7.0s)]
*  So I want to bring in CBS News foreign correspondent Holly Williams to talk a little bit more about this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=13.0s)]
*  Holly, what do we know about this incident? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=17.0s)]
*  Good morning, Vlad. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=20.0s)]
*  Well, German police say that at least 28 people were injured, including some children, some people seriously, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=21.0s)]
*  after that man drove his car into a crowd at around 1030 this morning local time at a square near downtown Munich. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=27.0s)]
*  As you know, world leaders are gathering in Munich today ahead of a security conference tomorrow, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=34.0s)]
*  including Vice President JD Vance and Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=40.0s)]
*  The police say that they fired a shot at the car and then detained the driver, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=44.0s)]
*  who they say is believed to be a 24-year-old asylum seeker from Afghanistan. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=49.0s)]
*  Now, the governor of that region, Bavaria, said that the incident is suspected to have been an attack. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=55.0s)]
*  The crowd was gathered there for a protest organized by a union. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=61.0s)]
*  Now, Germany goes to the polls for a national election in just over a week. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=65.0s)]
*  Immigration is already a key issue, and this incident will likely play into that at that national election. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=70.0s)]
*  Wow. All right. We'll be tracking that throughout the next couple of days, Holly. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=79.0s)]
*  Let's pivot to a discussion that we started yesterday about Ukraine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=83.0s)]
*  As you know, President Trump spoke with both Vladimir Putin and President Zelensky of Ukraine this morning. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=87.0s)]
*  He posted that he feels that a deal can be reached to stop the war. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=93.0s)]
*  As you can imagine, there is mixed reaction to this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=97.0s)]
*  First, I want to play, Holly, for you sound from the former ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=99.0s)]
*  Listen to what he had to say. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=105.0s)]
*  I think there is a real possibility. I think there is a real possibility. All sides want it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=106.0s)]
*  The Russians are hurting. They need to stop this war. They've got incredible economic problems. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=111.0s)]
*  The Ukrainians obviously want to stop this war, and Europeans do, and the United States does. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=117.0s)]
*  So, yes, I think there's a real possibility this war could end this year. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=122.0s)]
*  All right. So folks want the war to end. That's clear. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=125.0s)]
*  But Holly, this is a post from former National Security Advisor John Bolton, and it says in part, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=129.0s)]
*  It is unconscionable to allow Russia to assault Ukraine's sovereignty, recruit enemies like North Korea to aid in their fight, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=134.0s)]
*  and then sell out the Ukrainians by conceding the loss of their territory and NATO security guarantees or membership. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=141.0s)]
*  By making these and other concessions before negotiations even started, Trump has effectively surrendered to Putin on Ukraine. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=148.0s)]
*  I saw another post from Ambassador Bolton, Holly, where he said that the Kremlin is drinking vodka straight from the bottle [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=155.0s)]
*  after hearing from President Trump yesterday. What are you hearing from your sources on the ground about this? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=163.0s)]
*  Well, look, President Trump sounded very positive, didn't he, after that phone call with Putin. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=168.0s)]
*  The Kremlin said that the phone call lasted nearly one and a half hours. I think here's the problem for Ukrainians. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=174.0s)]
*  What kind of ceasefire will Trump and Putin negotiate, and will it actually bring a lasting peace to Ukraine? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=180.0s)]
*  I mean, yesterday, the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegs, said that while the U.S. supports an independent Ukraine, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=187.0s)]
*  it does not support NATO membership for Ukraine with all the security guarantees that that would bring. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=194.0s)]
*  The U.S., he said, would not contribute soldiers to any international peacekeeping force in Ukraine. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=199.0s)]
*  And he also said that returning Ukraine to its pre-2014 borders was, quote, unrealistic. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=204.0s)]
*  So as a result, some Ukrainians fear that a ceasefire negotiated by President Trump could involve handing over part of their country, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=211.0s)]
*  part of their territory to Russia, without the security guarantees they want to stop Vladimir Putin reinvading, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=218.0s)]
*  doing it all over again in a few years' time. If that happened, it would be, it would effectively be a huge victory for Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=225.0s)]
*  It would reward him for invading Ukraine and igniting a war that has killed hundreds of, not killed, but caused hundreds of thousands of casualties on both sides. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=235.0s)]
*  Vlad. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=245.0s)]
*  Really quickly before you go, and I know this is happening in real time because the news is still just breaking, but has there been any reaction from Brussels? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=247.0s)]
*  I've seen some statements from European leaders that anything that happens with regards to ultimately a deal happening between Ukraine and Russia, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=255.0s)]
*  the Europeans would have to be involved and be supportive of it. So what are you hearing from on that front? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=263.0s)]
*  So, look, the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegs, had said yesterday that Europe needs to do more for European security. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=268.0s)]
*  And we've heard the same thing from European defense ministers, that Europe should do more, that Europe should step up its efforts. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=273.0s)]
*  But in an interview, a recent interview by Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky, he said that any security guarantees for Ukraine need to include the United States. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=280.0s)]
*  All right, Holly Williams with that deep analysis for us this morning. Holly, I appreciate you so much. Thank you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZ1qNwVwQI&t=292.0s)]
