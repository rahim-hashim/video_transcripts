# Some North Korean troops in Russia moving toward Ukraine border, Austin says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8)
*  There is a bit of breaking news that we want to get to, and that is a major escalation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=0.0s)]
*  in Russia's incursion into Ukraine with the help of North Korea. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=5.2s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had this to say about reports that North Korean troops [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=9.94s)]
*  wearing Russian uniforms are now on the march headed towards Ukraine's border. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=14.4s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=18.8s)]
*  We believe that DPRK has sent some 10,000 troops into eastern Ukraine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=19.8s)]
*  There they've been drawing equipment and conducting some training, and some of those troops have [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=27.68s)]
*  begun to make their way towards the border of Ukraine in the Kursk region. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=34.64s)]
*  Whether or not they'll be employed in the fight is left to be seen yet, but certainly [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=44.56s)]
*  if they are employed then that's very disturbing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=51.28s)]
*  So we remain concerned that they're going to use these troops in combat. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=56.46s)]
*  I won't speculate on the timing of employment. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=60.16s)]
*  Again, this is something we're going to continue to watch and we're going to continue to work [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=64.16s)]
*  with allies and partners to discourage Russia from employing these troops in combat. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=67.72s)]
*  Again, this is a violation of the UN security agreement. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=77.8s)]
*  So this is pretty serious. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=86.04s)]
*  Again, we're going to continue to watch it and continue to work with our allies and partners [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=91.04s)]
*  to discourage it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=100.08s)]
*  As I said in the opening statement, about 10,000 North Korean troops have been deployed [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=103.12s)]
*  in eastern Russia and in addition to that, we have been deployed here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=107.84s)]
*  Alright, listening in from the Pentagon there, we'll continue following those developments [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=114.08s)]
*  and bring any of the breaking news headlines that might come out of that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkWmeGXZRi8&t=118.52s)]
