**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ)
*  We want to turn now to the war in Ukraine, where residents of Kherson are fleeing the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=0.0s)]
*  city this weekend after sustained Russian bombardment knocked out power and water supplies, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=4.88s)]
*  the latest in Moscow's effort to undermine Ukrainian morale after more than nine months [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=10.88s)]
*  of brutal assault. CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Livesey is in Kyiv with this report. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=15.52s)]
*  Ukraine has already proven it can withstand the Russians. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=22.64s)]
*  But what about the winter? At the front line, the cold and relentless artillery. Maybe Russia's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=26.48s)]
*  only hope to weaponize winter and freeze Ukraine's momentum. Trenches like these become more and more [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=36.0s)]
*  commonplace the closer you get to the front line. And there's a really good reason for it. You don't [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=42.56s)]
*  just see and hear the flashes of artillery, but you can feel the thuds deep in your gut. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=47.6s)]
*  But Ukrainians can also feel it right at their doorstep. Natalia Khristenko was coming home [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=53.52s)]
*  after drinking tea in Kherson. Medics, overwhelmed throughout a night of bombardment, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=60.64s)]
*  didn't arrive until morning. Their city, only recently the scene of dancing after Russia's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=66.16s)]
*  retreat, now limps through the dark and cold. Much like the capital Kyiv, the scene of a deadly [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=72.0s)]
*  missile attack this week. Ina and her son, are two, have to shelter in a community tent. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=79.84s)]
*  We have no electricity and no water. Our phones and devices are out of battery. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=87.12s)]
*  We do everything we can to distract Arthur from what's really going on. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=91.28s)]
*  Kyiv's mayor, Vitaly Kalichko, is fuming. Right now, before the winter, the people, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  Putin and Russians, want to let us be without electricity, without heating, without water. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=101.2s)]
*  It's genocide. It's actually terrorism. The main goal of Russians to bring depression [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=107.44s)]
*  of society. I talk to the people, no negotiations with Russians. We, people, is angry. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=116.16s)]
*  And the mayor says he never stops worrying about a nuclear disaster. In fact, the shelling has been [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=124.88s)]
*  so severe, the country had to disconnect all of its nuclear power plants temporarily. It was the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=130.4s)]
*  first time in 40 years. Margaret? Chris Lipsay, thank you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pRkjTr0dQ&t=136.4s)]
