# National security adviser Jake Sullivan describes "monumental effort" to secure prisoner swap
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg)
*  Let's listen in to the White House press briefing room, press secretary, Corinne Jean-Pierre. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=0.0s)]
*  To bring your loved ones home where they belong. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  And with that, I will turn it over to our national security advisor, Jake Sullivan. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=7.76s)]
*  Thank you, Corinne, and good afternoon, everyone. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=15.68s)]
*  Today, as you've seen and heard from the president and from Corinne, we've completed one of the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=18.28s)]
*  largest and certainly the most complex exchange in history. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  And Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, Alsou Kermesheva, and Vladimir Kara-Murza, three American citizens [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=27.16s)]
*  and one American green card holder, are finally coming home. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=33.44s)]
*  I have the honor and pleasure of joining the president this morning in the Oval Office [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=37.4s)]
*  as he shared the wonderful news with the families. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=40.76s)]
*  And then together, they spoke with Paul, Evan, Alsou, and Vladimir, who are on the tarmac [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  in Ankara with U.S. officials where the exchange happened. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=48.84s)]
*  To say that everyone in the room was overjoyed, even at a loss for words, is an understatement. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=52.88s)]
*  Since taking office, President Biden and Vice President Harris have made clear that they [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  will not stop working until every American wrongfully detained or held hostage around [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  the world is reunited with their family. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=67.08s)]
*  As an administration, we're proud to celebrate the return home of over 70 such Americans [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=69.76s)]
*  from places around the world like Afghanistan, Burma, Gaza, Haiti, Iran, Russia, Venezuela, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  Rwanda, and elsewhere. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=81.28s)]
*  Today's exchange is a feat of diplomacy that honestly could only be achieved by a leader [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=84.0s)]
*  like Joe Biden. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=88.56s)]
*  At his direction, the professionals in our national security, foreign policy, and intelligence [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=89.56s)]
*  community worked tirelessly and relentlessly to secure the release of 16 individuals who [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=93.92s)]
*  were detained in Russia. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=99.8s)]
*  The three American citizens, one American green card holder, five German citizens, and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=102.0s)]
*  prisoners in exchange for eight individuals held in a combination of the United States, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=107.76s)]
*  Germany, Norway, Slovenia, and Poland. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  The president was himself personally engaged in the diplomacy that brought this about, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=117.12s)]
*  including multiple conversations with Chancellor Schultz, with the other leaders of the countries [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  who provided some of the Russians as part of the exchange, and most recently, as has [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  now been reported, calling the prime minister of Slovenia early in the afternoon of Sunday, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  July 21st, to coordinate the final arrangements to make the final piece of this deal fall [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=139.16s)]
*  into place. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=143.88s)]
*  There is no more singular or concrete demonstration that the alliances that the president has [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  reinvigorated around the world matter to Americans, to the individual safety of Americans, and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=151.36s)]
*  to the collective security of Americans. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=156.84s)]
*  And we're deeply grateful to our allies who supported us in these complex negotiations [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=159.64s)]
*  to achieve this outcome. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=163.92s)]
*  And while I'm standing at this podium, the president is reaching out to give personal [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=165.44s)]
*  thanks to the leaders of Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, and Turkey. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=170.28s)]
*  And honestly, guys, I can just say this was vintage Joe Biden rallying American allies [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=175.6s)]
*  to save American citizens and Russian freedom fighters, and doing it with intricate state [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=183.04s)]
*  craft, pulling his whole team together to drive this across the finish line. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=187.4s)]
*  ... who are enduring an unimaginable ordeal. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=192.4s)]
*  From the president on down, we've stayed in regular and routine touch with them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  I spent a lot of time with the families of Evan and Paul and also, most of the time, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=202.0s)]
*  as you can imagine, those are tough conversations. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=208.72000000000003s)]
*  But not today. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=211.68s)]
*  Today... [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=212.68s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=213.68s)]
*  Whew. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  Today was a very good day. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to build on it, drawing inspiration and continued courage from it for all of those [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=221.08s)]
*  who were held hostage or wrongfully detained around the world. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=226.24s)]
*  And that includes Mark Fogel, who we are actively working to get his release from Russia as [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=229.36s)]
*  well. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=235.28s)]
*  And there are others being held in Syria, Afghanistan, other countries around the world [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=236.28s)]
*  who we are working to get released. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=240.28s)]
*  And just on a personal note, I want to say that this is the culmination of a monumental [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=243.0s)]
*  level of effort and level of skill by my teammates across the national security enterprise. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=247.08s)]
*  My colleagues here at the NSC, my colleagues at the Central Intelligence Agency, my colleagues [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=254.0s)]
*  at the State Department, these are dedicated, talented professionals who are not in the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=258.2s)]
*  headlines, who don't get to stand at a podium like this one. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=263.12s)]
*  And it was at the president's direction that they built and pulled off the most intricate, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=266.56s)]
*  deal of its kind in memory. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  So they know who they are. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=273.2s)]
*  I salute them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=275.4s)]
*  And every American should be proud to have those kind of people standing up on their [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=277.02s)]
*  behalf and on behalf of American security. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  While this has unfolded, we've been closely monitoring the events in the Middle East as [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=288.12s)]
*  Since October 7th, we have worked to deter and prevent escalation into a wider regional [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=289.12s)]
*  war. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=294.08s)]
*  That risk has always been there. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=295.2s)]
*  That risk is there now. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=297.12s)]
*  We are determined to engage in deterrence, defense and de-escalation to try to ensure [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=298.8s)]
*  that we do not have a wider regional conflict or escalation that goes unchecked. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=304.72s)]
*  So I'm happy to get more into that in response to your questions. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  And with that, I'll turn it over to you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=313.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=315.32000000000005s)]
*  Thanks, Jake. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=316.32000000000005s)]
*  Whose idea was it to try to go big and bring everyone home at once instead of going for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=317.32000000000005s)]
*  a simpler one-for-one type deal? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=323.04s)]
*  And why? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=326.04s)]
*  That's a great question, which I don't feel entirely comfortable answering because this [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=327.88s)]
*  was an organic process involving a lot of people across our government. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=332.8s)]
*  But what I will say is this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  The president sat us down on a regular basis over the course of the detentions of Paul, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=338.64s)]
*  Evan and also, and really pushed us to think about what configuration would actually work [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=344.12s)]
*  to make this happen. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=350.82s)]
*  And it was through an iterative process of back and forth with various of the allies [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=353.12s)]
*  I mentioned, with engagements with our Russian counterparts, where we were making proposals, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=359.4s)]
*  getting responses, that this all came together. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=365.96s)]
*  And so I would say that if you had not had Joe Biden sitting in the Oval Office, I don't [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=369.12s)]
*  think this would have happened. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=373.56s)]
*  But as I said in my remarks, there were a lot of other people who played a central role [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  in building out the pieces of this and then executing on that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=379.36s)]
*  And the execution phase of this, to get this level of coordination together, to have those [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=383.0s)]
*  plans all land on the tarmac at the same time from multiple different countries with so [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=388.24s)]
*  many different individuals coming from Russia and going back to Russia, really extraordinary. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=393.08000000000004s)]
*  And I think team effort can be a cliché, but I think in this case it's a warranted description [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=398.8s)]
*  of what happened. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=404.04s)]
*  So, was Alexei Navalny supposed to be a part of this deal before he died in prison? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=405.92s)]
*  So we had been working with our partners on a deal that would have included Alexei Navalny. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=409.88s)]
*  And unfortunately he died. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=421.0s)]
*  In fact, on the very day that he died, I saw Ivan's parents and I told them that the president [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  was determined to get this done even in light of that tragic news and that we were going [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=432.92s)]
*  to work day and night to get to this day. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=436.72s)]
*  And so that work continued over the course of the past few months and culminated in today. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=440.72s)]
*  You've mentioned it a little bit, but can you describe and give us a little bit more [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=444.72s)]
*  color on that Oval Office conversation just before the president came out? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=448.12s)]
*  Did all four Americans get to speak? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  Did each of the family members get to speak to their loved ones? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  Did the president tear up? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=455.96000000000004s)]
*  Did you tear up? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=457.56s)]
*  I saved my tearing up for this podium. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  I would like to strike that from the record if we could use that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if that's permitted. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=465.71999999999997s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  So, the president invited the family members in at the moment that we received the word [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  from the tarmac in Ankara that the exchange was complete. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  And he was able to give them the news directly that the exchange was in fact complete. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  Then Paul, Evan, and Alsou were in one place. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=487.12s)]
*  Vladimir was actually in another place. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=493.12s)]
*  So he conducted two calls from the Oval Office. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=494.12s)]
*  One with the three American citizens on the phone. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=497.12s)]
*  And he welcomed their freedom, said that on behalf of the American people he was so proud [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=501.12s)]
*  to have them out, and then very quickly turned the phone over to their family members. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=508.12s)]
*  And then the French family got the opportunity to engage by phone with their loved one who was out. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=513.52s)]
*  He then conducted a second call with Vladimir. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=518.52s)]
*  And Vladimir's wife, one of their daughters, and their son were there to be able to speak [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=521.52s)]
*  with him. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=529.52s)]
*  And the president and he also got to reminisce on the fact that they were both pallbearers [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=530.52s)]
*  together at John McCain's wedding, John McCain's funeral. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=535.52s)]
*  And so it was a kind of extraordinary personal exchange in the Oval Office. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=540.92s)]
*  And the family members were both overwhelmed, of course, by the events of the day and also [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=547.92s)]
*  standing there in the presence of the U.S. president at the resolute desk. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=552.92s)]
*  So it was quite a moment. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=556.92s)]
*  And can you talk about how the administration tries to make sure this doesn't incentivize [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=559.92s)]
*  more arrests of innocent Americans beyond what the president said, advising people not [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=565.92s)]
*  to go abroad in certain places, especially because you're looking at this inherent imbalance [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  between releasing or between securing the release of innocent Americans in exchange [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=575.3199999999999s)]
*  for wrongly convicted criminals, including a murder? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=579.3199999999999s)]
*  Look, it's a fair question. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  It's a question that we grapple with every time that we look at the hard decisions involved [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=583.3199999999999s)]
*  in one of these exchanges. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  It is difficult to send back a convicted criminal to secure the release of an innocent American. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=592.72s)]
*  And yet sometimes the choices between doing that and consigning that person basically [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=599.72s)]
*  to live out their days in prison in a hostile foreign country or in the hands of a hostile [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=606.72s)]
*  power. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=612.72s)]
*  So from our perspective, we have assessed and analyzed that risk and we have judged [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=613.72s)]
*  that the benefit of reuniting Americans, of bringing people home and also of vindicating [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=621.12s)]
*  the idea that the American government are going to do what it takes to protect and secure [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=626.12s)]
*  the release of innocent Americans, that that benefit outweighs the risk and that's how [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=633.12s)]
*  we have proceeded. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=638.62s)]
*  I would point out in addition to that, that in periods of time when the U.S. government [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=639.62s)]
*  didn't tend to do prisoner exchanges, Americans were unjustly detained and held hostage overseas. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=645.62s)]
*  In periods where we did, Americans were unjustly detained and held hostage overseas. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=652.62s)]
*  So I think there are real questions and Roger Carstens, the hostage negotiator at the State [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=657.52s)]
*  Department has actually pointed out that in this analysis, it is not quite as clear cut [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=663.02s)]
*  that the evidence actually demonstrates the kind of result that your question speaks to, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=668.4s)]
*  that a lot more people get taken because we do these exchanges. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=675.4s)]
*  But it's something that we have to pay attention to and it's something that makes these decisions [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=678.34s)]
*  by the president not simple decisions, hard decisions, and yet as he did today, he was [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=682.84s)]
*  prepared to make them. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=688.28s)]
*  Can you explain a bit more, when did it become clear that Krasikov was this lynchpin to a [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=689.28s)]
*  deal like this and was it during the negotiations of O'Britney Greiner? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=694.98s)]
*  When you're engaged in a negotiation and one side lays down a position, there's not like [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=701.38s)]
*  a light bulb moment when you say, okay, that position is immovable. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=706.3s)]
*  That has to be tested and alternatives have to be suggested and proposals get put on the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=710.14s)]
*  table and rejected, new proposals and rejected. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=715.66s)]
*  So it is less of a aha moment, okay, now we know, and it's more something that you accumulate [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=719.7s)]
*  through the experience of the negotiation. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=728.62s)]
*  And so over the course of this negotiation, we did reach the conclusion that Krasikov [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=731.3s)]
*  was a key. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=735.9799999999999s)]
*  You've discussed obviously the president's involvement, direct involvement in all of [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=736.9799999999999s)]
*  this. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=740.66s)]
*  Can you talk us through any involvement that the vice president had? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=741.66s)]
*  Was she also speaking directly to other leaders and allies? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=743.8199999999999s)]
*  So as I said in my opening comments, both President Biden and Vice President Harris [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=748.24s)]
*  unjustly detained Americans, hostage, American hostages in absolute priority. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=755.34s)]
*  And in this particular case, Vice President Harris actually had an opportunity to engage [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=761.5s)]
*  with Chancellor Schultz earlier this year at an opportune and timely moment at the Munich [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=767.1800000000001s)]
*  Security Conference where she talked about this issue with him. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=771.82s)]
*  That followed on a conversation that the president had just a short time before that and it was [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=776.44s)]
*  in the run of high level engagements and a back and forth that the president and the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=781.18s)]
*  chancellor were having that Vice President Harris was actually able to sit face to face [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=786.54s)]
*  with Chancellor Schultz and talk through the elements of this. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=790.0999999999999s)]
*  And then I've sat in the Oval Office more times than I can count over the course of [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=794.68s)]
*  the past years, providing briefings and updates on this and getting peppered with questions [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=798.8599999999999s)]
*  by both the president and the vice president, thinking through strategy, iterating the approach [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=804.4s)]
*  she was a participant in very much, a core member of the team that helped make this happen. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=811.0600000000001s)]
*  Two quick questions. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=816.0600000000001s)]
*  One, as it relates to the president's interactions with Chancellor Schultz. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=817.0600000000001s)]
*  It's been detailed to us, but maybe from the podium you could help us understand. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=819.9s)]
*  Chancellor Schultz had to make a big sacrifice giving up Krasikov here, a Russian criminal. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=823.7s)]
*  What specifically did the German chancellor say to President Biden about his willingness [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=828.1800000000001s)]
*  to do this? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=832.34s)]
*  Well, I will leave that to Chancellor Schultz because I think for important and sensitive [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=833.34s)]
*  conversations, leaders should speak for themselves. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=838.14s)]
*  The White House said he said for you, and then he said, I will do this. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=841.78s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=845.3s)]
*  And if so, can you at least detail that? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=846.3s)]
*  I can confirm that he did say that, but I thought you were asking sort of to elaborate [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=848.26s)]
*  in greater detail, which I just I'm afraid I don't feel comfortable doing because he [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=852.5s)]
*  can, he can speak to his conversations with the president. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=856.74s)]
*  What I will say, and President Biden made this point when he spoke to the press just [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=859.74s)]
*  a short time ago, that relationship between the president and the chancellor, relationship [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=863.94s)]
*  of respect, relationship of genuine friendship, had the character of being able to work through [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=869.5400000000001s)]
*  this sensitive issue in a way that wasn't antiseptic or professional. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=875.5400000000001s)]
*  It was two guys actually trying to figure out a solution. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=880.5s)]
*  That was the nature of all of the conversations, and ultimately the chancellor was able to [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=884.0400000000001s)]
*  say to the president, let's do this. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=887.58s)]
*  Just to be clear, my second question, today is clearly a day of celebration, but already [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=888.9000000000001s)]
*  there is some criticism, including from the Republican vice presidential nominee, J.D. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=892.62s)]
*  Vance, who moments ago said, I think what this demonstrates, I think that really what [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=897.4599999999999s)]
*  this shows is that a lot of bad guys across the world are worried that Donald Trump is [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=902.26s)]
*  coming back into office. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=905.98s)]
*  Your response to those comments? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=907.5799999999999s)]
*  I don't follow. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=909.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=910.5s)]
*  Thank you, Jake. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=911.5s)]
*  Can you talk about what, if any, engagements the U.S. officials had with Vladimir Putin [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=912.5s)]
*  as part of this? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=917.5s)]
*  No engagement directly with Vladimir Putin. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=919.0999999999999s)]
*  What about his deputies? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=921.66s)]
*  There was extensive engagement with Russian officials over the course of this. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=922.78s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the details because those channels are sensitive and need to be [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=927.3000000000001s)]
*  protected for exactly this reason, because having those sensitive channels enables us [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=931.1s)]
*  to produce results like today. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=936.22s)]
*  And then last week in the Oval Office, President Biden said that he remains committed to bringing [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=937.22s)]
*  Americans home during his final six months in office. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=942.02s)]
*  How important was it for him to get this deal before leaving office? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=945.94s)]
*  Honestly, I don't think he was thinking about it like, I've got to get it before I leave [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=951.7800000000001s)]
*  office. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=957.0200000000001s)]
*  He was thinking about it from the family's perspective, which is every day is a lost [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=958.0200000000001s)]
*  day. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=961.62s)]
*  So I want to do this as rapidly as humanly possible. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=962.62s)]
*  I want to push the pace on it because the longer that these Americans are held abroad, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=965.2600000000001s)]
*  the greater the risk and the greater the pain. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=971.34s)]
*  So for him, it was really important to do the deal, but less tied to his time in office [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=974.1s)]
*  and more tied to the power and responsibility he had and wanted to exercise to get this [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=980.58s)]
*  done as fast as he possibly could. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=985.3s)]
*  I just want to follow up on this interaction with the Russians. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=986.3s)]
*  Does this in any way lay any groundwork for discussions about the war in Ukraine with [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=991.3s)]
*  the Ukrainians? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=998.3s)]
*  I mean, just to sort of say, look, we've cooperated on this. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=999.3s)]
*  Is there any path that this creates any sort of goodwill in terms of creating more discussion? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1003.54s)]
*  We do not see a link between the hostage negotiation or the detained persons negotiations and any [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1011.74s)]
*  potential diplomacy over the war in Ukraine. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1019.78s)]
*  We see those as operating on separate tracks. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1021.6999999999999s)]
*  One is really about the practical issue of producing this exchange. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1024.82s)]
*  The other is a much more complex question where the Ukrainians will be in the lead and [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1028.94s)]
*  the United States will consult closely with all of our allies to support them when they [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1035.5s)]
*  are prepared to step forward and engage in that kind of diplomacy. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1040.3s)]
*  Can I just follow up on – so if we can't have you here and not ask you what was happening [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1043.3s)]
*  in unfolding, the Middle East and with Iran and with the killing of Hanyan, can you please [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1050.3s)]
*  just give us your assessment of how high the temperature really is and how great the risks [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1056.7s)]
*  are now of an all-out war, a bigger war? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1062.26s)]
*  Just taking a step back, we have been laser-focused on trying to prevent that wider war since [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1067.58s)]
*  October 7th. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1072.82s)]
*  There have been moments that have required intensive effort to keep a lid on things. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1075.22s)]
*  The risk has always been there and the risk remains today. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1083.4599999999998s)]
*  We believe we do have to be engaging in intensive efforts now through deterrence, through de-escalation, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1089.1s)]
*  through diplomacy to prevent a wider war, and we will continue to do that. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1095.6999999999998s)]
*  Thanks, Jake. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1099.9399999999998s)]
*  Back in May, former President Trump made the comment that Russia would release Evan Gorshkovich [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1100.9399999999998s)]
*  for him after the upcoming election, quote, but not for anyone else. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1105.78s)]
*  Did that comment complicate negotiations at all, and do you have a response to Trump's [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1111.06s)]
*  comment now? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1116.1399999999999s)]
*  Look, I'm just happy these guys are out and home and I won't wade into the comments [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1118.1399999999999s)]
*  of the former president. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1125.82s)]
*  What about Jimmy Wilgus? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1126.82s)]
*  Are you working on him? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1127.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1128.82s)]
*  Jake, you noted that the president spoke to the leader of Slovenia right around the time [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1129.82s)]
*  he was making his decision on his political future. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1134.82s)]
*  How much was the thinking that he had to go through on his future part of this process [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1137.34s)]
*  leading up to these negotiations? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1143.98s)]
*  Was it something that weighed on him for days ahead of his call? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1145.98s)]
*  Look, to be honest with you, the way in which this unfolded played out over the course of [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1150.78s)]
*  weeks, even months, to put all of the pieces in place. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1157.1399999999999s)]
*  So, the timing and the cadence of the different elements coming together, the feature of the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1162.54s)]
*  diplomacy and the decision-making of each of the countries involved, it wasn't about [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1169.86s)]
*  American politics, the American political calendar, the president's thinking on other [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1173.82s)]
*  issues. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1177.6599999999999s)]
*  And it did happen to line up on that Sunday in that way, but not through a conscious decision [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1178.98s)]
*  to make it so, but rather because that's when the pieces were falling into place. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1185.42s)]
*  And that's the moment when the president had to drop that final piece in. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1190.06s)]
*  And it just so happened to come a couple of hours before he made his announcement. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1194.1s)]
*  And when do you think we will actually see them on American soil? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1197.1799999999998s)]
*  Will the president greet them personally? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1199.82s)]
*  I think you can expect to see Evan, Paul, and also later tonight on American soil. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1202.3s)]
*  And as the president mentioned in his remarks earlier, they'll be landing at Andrews Air [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1212.1399999999999s)]
*  Force Base. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1217.38s)]
*  The president and the vice president will be out there to greet them. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1219.26s)]
*  Vladimir Karamurza is going to be traveling to Germany, and his family, who was here with [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1222.46s)]
*  the president this morning, will be traveling there to join him. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1228.7s)]
*  But as Vladimir and the president discussed today, we expect him back here in the United [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1231.74s)]
*  States soon for him to be able to see the president and other people in the U.S. government. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1236.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1241.5s)]
*  Thank you, Jake. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1243.14s)]
*  Switching gears for a moment, I want to ask you about the P deal that was breached with [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1244.14s)]
*  9-11 suspects by military courts down in Guantanamo. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1250.14s)]
*  Republicans are condemning this as showing weakness and calling it a sweetheart deal [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1255.42s)]
*  because it avoids trial and the death penalty. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1261.3s)]
*  I was wondering if the administration has any response to that. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1264.3s)]
*  As we said last night, the White House received word that the convening authority had entered [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1268.18s)]
*  these pretrial agreements that had been negotiated by military prosecutors with KSM and some [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1274.14s)]
*  of the other 9-11 defendants. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1280.0600000000002s)]
*  And we had no role in that process. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1282.66s)]
*  The president had no role. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1284.8600000000001s)]
*  The vice president had no role. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1285.8600000000001s)]
*  I had no role. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1287.14s)]
*  The president had no role. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1288.14s)]
*  And we were informed yesterday, the same day that they went out publicly, that this pretrial [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1289.66s)]
*  agreement had been accepted by the convening authority. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1295.94s)]
*  What the president did, upon learning of that, was direct his team to consult, as appropriate, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1299.5800000000002s)]
*  with officials and lawyers at the Department of Defense on this matter. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1306.14s)]
*  Those consultations are ongoing, and I have nothing more to add at this time. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1309.46s)]
*  And one more thing. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1313.1000000000001s)]
*  On Iran-Israel Hamas negotiations, now that the new Hamas negotiator is dead, who is there [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1315.46s)]
*  to negotiate with? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1326.0200000000002s)]
*  And why, in your estimation, would Hamas continue towards negotiating a subspired deal when [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1328.0200000000002s)]
*  the new negotiator was just killed by the people they're negotiating with? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1336.98s)]
*  It is too soon to tell what the impact of his death will have on the negotiations, and [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1341.38s)]
*  so I'm not going to speculate on that, especially in light of the broader dynamics and set of [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1349.18s)]
*  events unfolding in the region right now. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1353.98s)]
*  What I will say is this. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1356.34s)]
*  The ceasefire and hostage deal is the pathway to ending this war. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1358.3s)]
*  It is the pathway to getting all of the hostages home, including the American citizen hostages [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1361.66s)]
*  who are relentlessly focused on getting home, and we remain determined to get it done. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1366.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1371.22s)]
*  Did the president have a call today with Prime Minister Netanyahu, or is he having one? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1372.22s)]
*  I believe the Israeli government has put out that they're having a call. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1377.98s)]
*  We had not announced that yet, but in fact, the president is intending to speak with [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1382.38s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu later today. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1386.0200000000002s)]
*  They have not spoken yet. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1387.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1388.38s)]
*  And is the president going to express any displeasure about not having a heads up about [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1389.38s)]
*  the attack on the Hamas leader or these other big things that have happened in the last [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1396.5800000000002s)]
*  few days with Israel taking countermeasures? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1402.22s)]
*  So I'm not going to preview the president's message before he has a chance to speak directly [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1404.7800000000002s)]
*  And then if I had to predict, I probably will be tight lipped about the readout afterward. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1410.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1413.78s)]
*  Thanks, Jake. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1414.78s)]
*  I just wondered if you could make clear for us, when was the actual moment when you really [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1415.78s)]
*  knew that this deal was going to be done and that it was sealed, or was that not really [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1418.5s)]
*  until today and you actually saw them, you released people on the tarmac and anchored? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1422.66s)]
*  We steadily gained confidence following the president's call on the 21st of July, but [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1429.26s)]
*  that confidence was always tempered by the reality that this was a fragile deal, a complex [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1438.1s)]
*  deal that could fall apart at any moment from multiple different directions. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1442.5s)]
*  So we held our breath and crossed our fingers until just a couple hours ago. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1446.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1450.46s)]
*  Jake, I wanted to ask about arms control treaties. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1451.46s)]
*  It seems like Russia has been backsliding when it comes to these deals. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1454.4199999999998s)]
*  What is the update with that? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1459.1799999999998s)]
*  Is there any progress with getting them to rejoin any of these treaties? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1460.1799999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1465.26s)]
*  The short answer is there is no progress. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1466.46s)]
*  We have to engage. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1468.46s)]
*  And I have publicly stated, and my colleagues have also laid out our view, that there is [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1470.46s)]
*  an arms control agenda that's in the interests of the security of the United States, our [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1477.66s)]
*  allies, and frankly global stability. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1482.1s)]
*  And we have not seen reciprocity on the Russian side to engage in those discussions at this [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1485.44s)]
*  time. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1490.22s)]
*  So we're obviously working very closely with NATO, with our other allies and partners, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1491.4199999999998s)]
*  to ensure that our security is going to be strong, resilient, and credible no matter [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1496.9399999999998s)]
*  what comes next. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1503.26s)]
*  But we do remain available to engage in arms control, as we did with the Soviet Union at [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1504.58s)]
*  the height of the Cold War. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1508.98s)]
*  Last question. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1509.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1510.98s)]
*  Jake, can you just confirm that no money was exchanged, no sanctions were loosened to facilitate [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1511.98s)]
*  this deal? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1518.6999999999998s)]
*  Yes, I can confirm that. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1519.6999999999998s)]
*  And can you also speak to why the President chose not to use his moment in front of the [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1521.06s)]
*  cameras to deliver a warning to Putin? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1525.3400000000001s)]
*  He said, I don't need to speak to Putin. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1526.8600000000001s)]
*  But what he didn't convey was a price that countries will pay if they abduct Americans [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1529.1000000000001s)]
*  for political purposes. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1535.52s)]
*  We have made clear through every conceivable channel, and the President has made clear [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1537.5s)]
*  publicly on repeated occasions over the last two years about the costs and consequences [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1544.38s)]
*  of aggression, standing against United States interests, and of taking actions that we believe [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1550.5s)]
*  are unlawful and unjust. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1556.78s)]
*  We're going to continue to do that as we go forward. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1558.9399999999998s)]
*  For the President today, this was a moment to thank our allies. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1561.02s)]
*  It was a moment to celebrate the families, and most importantly, it was a moment to lift [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1564.98s)]
*  up the human achievement of getting both Americans, citizens of friendly countries, and Russian [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1568.78s)]
*  political prisoners out. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1577.1399999999999s)]
*  But as the President said, he doesn't need to talk to Putin for Putin to understand where [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1579.3s)]
*  the President stands. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1582.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1583.78s)]
*  What about Putin? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9vfEOOZvg&t=1584.78s)]
