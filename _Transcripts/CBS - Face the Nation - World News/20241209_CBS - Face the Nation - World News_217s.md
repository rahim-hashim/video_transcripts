# Syrians who left country during civil war return home after Assad regime collapse
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc)
*  We're seeing a return home to Syria for many now that former dictator Bashar al-Assad and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=0.0s)]
*  his government are no longer in control. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=5.72s)]
*  Syrian migrants who had left the country during the civil war lined up in countries like Turkey [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=8.2s)]
*  and are now crossing back into their homeland. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=13.16s)]
*  Crowds gathered to cheer for the release of prisoners jailed during the civil war who [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=16.28s)]
*  opposed the Assad regime. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=20.12s)]
*  Free prisoners were seen hugging people in the streets. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=22.2s)]
*  Joining me now on set is CBS News reporter Courtney Keeney. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=25.48s)]
*  She's been on the ground in Syria and the Middle East covering this region since 1998. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=28.4s)]
*  Courtney, what are you hearing from people inside Syria about the end of the regime? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=32.08s)]
*  I think the way it was best described to me is people are experiencing trauma 101. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=36.36s)]
*  My source said, speaking to her family, she said, remember, this was a sadistic regime [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  that was in place for over 50 years, generation after generation. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=45.12s)]
*  Jubilation, elation, grief, joy, fear. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=49.28s)]
*  Yesterday there were a lot of Israeli airstrikes that furthered their fear that Israel was [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=54.36s)]
*  going to come into Damascus, not knowing who was coming in and how it was going to go. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=58.8s)]
*  That was the initial fear. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=63.08s)]
*  People were staying at home and sharing information, but now we're seeing people coming out to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=64.88s)]
*  get supplies and Jolani really establishing this interim kind of authoritative government. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=68.92s)]
*  What do we know about him? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=75.52s)]
*  Well, what we know about him is he's issuing decree after decree today that are very key [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=76.52s)]
*  and important. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=80.32s)]
*  The first thing that he issued in the first place was a decree that said that the borders [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=81.32s)]
*  in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon are open and free for refugees to come back in. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  They have checkpoints. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=90.28s)]
*  Nobody will have to show ID or speak. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  That means they don't have to show their Alawite or Sunni or Shia or Christian, and they won't [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  have their accent detected. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=99.08s)]
*  That's been used in civil wars past to assassinate people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  People can go through these checkpoints and offer up their weapons and nothing else. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=103.96s)]
*  There will be no decree that women will have to wear any kind of dress. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=108.76s)]
*  No hijabs. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  They wear free dresses they want. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  Very well received. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  President Biden, in his remarks Sunday, talked about establishing a transition toward an [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=119.56s)]
*  independent and sovereign Syria. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=123.12s)]
*  What could that mean for the country's future? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=124.92s)]
*  Well, their future is very much dependent on their neighbors. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  How will Turkey play along? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=129.88s)]
*  Can Iraq show that they came out of a civil war and ISIS and established their own working [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=131.76s)]
*  government? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=136.36s)]
*  Lebanon is in tatters. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=137.36s)]
*  Can that be any support? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=138.84s)]
*  What will their relationship with Israel be? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=140.52s)]
*  How will the UN facilitate this? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  President Biden said they will take the lead and then we'll be seeing a change of administration. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=144.84s)]
*  So it's President Trump's. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  It's all in President Trump's hand as soon to be elect President Trump as he becomes [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  president. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=155.88000000000002s)]
*  It's all on him. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  Courtney Healy, thank you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  With the fall of Damascus, there is renewed hope for finding American journalist Austin [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=161.52s)]
*  He was kidnapped in Syria more than 12 years ago. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  The Marine Corps veterans mother Deborah Tice said Friday her family heard from a source [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=168.64s)]
*  vetted by the U.S. government that her son is alive and being treated well. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=172.48s)]
*  Last year, she spoke with CBS News about the U.S. efforts to bring her son home. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  There is sort of a fits and starts with movement, and I'm always assured that they're working [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  as hard as they can and fully committed. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=189.72s)]
*  And you know, there's only one measure for this. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=193.96s)]
*  When I have Austin in my arms, we've done the best job. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=199.36s)]
*  The FBI released a statement saying in part, quote, the FBI and our government partners [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=204.96s)]
*  remain committed to bringing Austin home to his family. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=208.92s)]
*  We are still offering a reward of up to $1 million for information that leads to Austin's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=211.72s)]
*  safe return. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skyc3YtNoFc&t=215.88s)]
