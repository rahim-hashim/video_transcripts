# World Bank Group president says global economy is in a "sharp slowdown"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ)
*  We now want to welcome David Malpass, president of the World Bank. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=3.12s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=4.48s)]
*  There are a lot of stressors on the global economic system right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  How do you describe where we are? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=9.64s)]
*  It's a sharp slowdown, including even China. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=11.56s)]
*  So we've seen the world growth fall by half since January in terms of GDP growth. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  But there's also shortages, there's inflation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  And the food shortages for the poorer countries are becoming a significant concern. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=23.32s)]
*  And they already are. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=29.0s)]
*  I mean, global inflation, it's not just the U.S., it's other wealthy countries around [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=30.0s)]
*  the world. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=34.12s)]
*  But you're also describing a recipe for global instability. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=35.12s)]
*  It feeds in when there's not enough food for weaker countries, poorer countries, that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  causes instability. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  And it's a big factor in the turnover of governments that's been occurring in quite a few of the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=49.04s)]
*  countries. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=54.72s)]
*  COVID caused the deepest global recession since World War II. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=55.72s)]
*  Now the world economy is in danger because of this Russian invasion in Ukraine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  How do you avoid a global recession with all of these factors? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=65.76s)]
*  Some countries, it's going to be very hard to do that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=71.08s)]
*  I think that leadership from the stronger countries is very important. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=73.32s)]
*  There are a lot of possibilities, tools. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=79.64s)]
*  For example, the central banks have many more tools than in 2008. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=82.6s)]
*  There are regulatory tools that they have. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  They now hold huge bond portfolios. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  Those could be, those are all funded by money from banks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  The bottom line is there needs to be lots more production. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=96.94s)]
*  And that's most available to the strongest countries. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=100.72s)]
*  The U.S. is the world's biggest economy and can increase production more than anybody [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=104.56s)]
*  else. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  If you were talking to Jerome Powell, the chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, you would [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=110.76s)]
*  say focus less on interest rates, focus more on what? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=114.04s)]
*  He's got multiple tools. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=117.56s)]
*  One is regulatory policy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  The Fed is an important regulator of banks. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=120.36s)]
*  So let the banks lend more. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  But then also on the bond side, reducing the bond portfolio would return more money to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  banks. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=132.28s)]
*  All of the money being used to hold the bond portfolio comes from banks. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=133.28s)]
*  And if they had more, they could lend. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=136.52s)]
*  And also the non-bank sector of the U.S. economy, that's one of the most innovative. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=138.68s)]
*  And it could put more money into the supply chain. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=144.66000000000003s)]
*  So a State Department official said a few days ago, food crisis will be at least a three-year [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  problem. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  What time horizon do you put on the food crisis and the energy crisis? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=154.16000000000003s)]
*  I'll say one thing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=158.4s)]
*  It's possible to produce enough to soften that crisis. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=159.84s)]
*  At the rate that we're going right now, the fertilizer isn't being made. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=164.56s)]
*  Fertilizer comes, a giant source of fertilizer is from natural gas through the ammonium channel [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=168.84s)]
*  into the most useful fertilizer. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=175.52s)]
*  And it also is used to make the electricity that converts the minerals into fertilizer. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=178.8s)]
*  And that's just not happening. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=185.52s)]
*  So a lot of the world is shutting down for lack of fertilizer. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=187.0s)]
*  And then those shortages of crops will last for multiple years. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=190.68s)]
*  We need to break that cycle and do it pretty forcefully now through announcements. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=194.8s)]
*  The Federal Reserve chair said this week in this country that recession is certainly a [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=199.84s)]
*  possibility, in part because of higher interest rates. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  Citigroup puts the odds of a recession at 50%. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  What's your projection here for the world's most important economy? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  We put out a report three weeks ago that didn't have the U.S. in recession, but we said in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  downside scenarios there could be. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=220.28s)]
*  And so I don't disagree with those estimates that you're saying there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=223.08s)]
*  So do you agree with Fed officials when they say it's going to take at least two years, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=227.0s)]
*  a couple of years before we get inflation back down to 2%? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=232.08s)]
*  It's going to take time to come down. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=235.88s)]
*  But again, that depends on what's your forecast for oil prices, for natural gas prices, for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=238.04s)]
*  fertilizer. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=244.0s)]
*  It's going to take months and months and maybe two years to bring inflation back down. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=245.0s)]
*  Thank you very much for your time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdA0eWxNHcQ&t=250.52s)]
