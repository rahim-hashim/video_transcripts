# Trump pushes Gaza plan as Netanyahu says ceasefire will end if Hamas doesn't return hostages
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk)
*  All right, so we are continuing to follow breaking news regarding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=0.0s)]
*  He says that fighting will resume in the Gaza Strip unless Hamas releases its hostage. They've given a deadline of Saturday [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=5.08s)]
*  Hamas said that they cut off the release of three more hostages on Saturday because Israel they say violated their ceasefire agreement [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=12.52s)]
*  So think about this. Let's do some timing here that news broke while this meeting was about to happen President Donald Trump [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=20.84s)]
*  Meeting with the King of Jordan King Abdullah there [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=28.66s)]
*  Mr. Trump continued to talk about his pressure on Arab nations to take in Palestinians as part of what he has promised of taking over [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=31.42s)]
*  Gaza, let's listen in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=38.900000000000006s)]
*  We will have Gaza. What is that? No reason to buy [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=41.260000000000005s)]
*  There is nothing to buy. It's Gaza. It's it's a war-torn area. We're gonna take it. We're gonna hold it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  We're gonna cherish it. We're going to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  Get it going eventually where a lot of jobs are going to be created for the people in the Middle East [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=54.580000000000005s)]
*  It's it's got to be for the people in the Middle East, but I think it could be a diamond. It could be an absolute [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=59.82s)]
*  Tremendous asset for the Middle East and you're gonna have peace. It's gonna bring peace in the Middle East [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=65.7s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News Middle East reporter Courtney Keighley. Welcome Courtney. Okay, so he was asked by what authority [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=71.14s)]
*  He said by US authority, but we have to keep in mind [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=77.84s)]
*  What about the will of the Palestinian people two million Palestinian people? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=80.98s)]
*  Absolutely, this is called the rate of return and this has been something that's been ongoing and in the Geneva Peace [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=88.14s)]
*  Conventions of 1948 also in the UN [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=94.06s)]
*  This has also been something that they've never gotten to in final status talks after Oslo [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=96.5s)]
*  Basically crumbled in 2000 and during the second Intifada, but it's one of the main pillars of peace now Palestinians [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=101.78s)]
*  There are refugees in Lebanon that they've been through multi generations in different wars same as Syria and there's 60% [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=109.46s)]
*  Of the Jordanian population is Palestinian the Palestinian problem [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=117.5s)]
*  Has bedeviled the region for all this time and many say unless this problem gets solved. There will be no [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=122.58s)]
*  prosperity or peace anywhere in the Middle East it's the crux of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=130.18s)]
*  Everything and the last time President Trump was president his first term [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=134.02s)]
*  He did go through with that Abraham Accords which left the Palestinians out of the equation now with the Gaza war now with this tenuous ceasefire [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=138.10000000000002s)]
*  With President Trump saying that US will hold this cherish this land and the Palestinians will be given land elsewhere [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=146.70000000000002s)]
*  That's really a non-starter for any of the Arab states and King Abdullah at this meeting that we just saw [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=153.3s)]
*  Them sitting in the Oval Office talking ahead of their longer discussion tried to put this as diplomatically as possible [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=158.86s)]
*  Charity, you know saying that they have a great relationship [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  avoiding that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=169.42000000000002s)]
*  third rail of politics that that discussion really of Palestinians [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=171.3s)]
*  But just basically saying and referring to that there's going to be an emergency Arab summit on February 27th [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=175.68s)]
*  So this is all on the table [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=183.74s)]
*  This is not going to be something that the Arab countries will allow or that they will take these Palestinians in [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=184.94s)]
*  Well, and you know if you did a word count between what President Donald Trump said and what the King of Jordan Mr [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=192.38000000000002s)]
*  Abdullah had to say you would see that the lion's share of the talking [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=198.62s)]
*  Was done by President Donald Trump when the King of Jordan was asked about this [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=201.94s)]
*  He had one word that he kept saying over and over and that is Egypt. How does Egypt factor into this? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=205.94s)]
*  Well Egypt and Jordan both have their peace deals with Israel and they've been critical partners and protectors of the state of Israel [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=213.5s)]
*  While other countries have been at war and the Iran nexus you had the Hamas and Hezbollah [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=221.94s)]
*  Nexus and the Iranians and the Shia crescent. So with it the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=227.86s)]
*  Egyptian Camp David accords that established peace during President Carter with the peace that was established between Jordan and Israel [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  30 years ago and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=240.74s)]
*  Jordan and Egypt get a lot of money and assistance from the US to keep the peace really and also keep regional stability [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=242.74s)]
*  so you have intelligence sharing with these leaders the general as [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  President Trump referred to him the other day general Cece of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=255.9s)]
*  They also want to keep their countries from spilling over into any kind of extremist conflict themselves [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  So it's not just money for aid and military assistance [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=267.06s)]
*  It's keeping their countries secure and keeping any spillover extremism from [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=270.90000000000003s)]
*  toppling their presidency or their kingdom and also [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=277.58000000000004s)]
*  Being aligned with Israel. So all of this is fragile and tenuous [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=282.38s)]
*  But it's something that the US has also said they haven't cut aid to Jordan and Egypt [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=286.48s)]
*  President Trump is not threatening to cut aid for instance, Jordan gets 1.6 billion dollars in aid [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=291.66s)]
*  Approximately Egypt get something similar and it's a lot of like I said intelligence sharing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=299.12s)]
*  It's not just keeping the peace and stability. It's also a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=305.0s)]
*  Relationship that's critical in terms of national security for all three countries [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, and now the news that broke during that meeting between the king and the president Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=315.12s)]
*  Really reinforcing what President Donald Trump said that if all hostages are not released by Saturday all hell will break loose [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  So you talk about tenuous you talk about fragile on many fronts there Courtney and Keely. Thank you so much for those thoughts [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HBzdpUE2vk&t=327.32s)]
