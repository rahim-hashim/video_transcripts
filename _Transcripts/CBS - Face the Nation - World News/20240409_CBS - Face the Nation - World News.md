**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w)
*  Secretary is in Washington today furthering talks about the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=0.0s)]
*  David Cameron met with the Secretary of State Antony Blinken this morning [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=5.04s)]
*  and reiterated the importance of Congress passing the multi-billion dollar aid package for Ukraine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=8.8s)]
*  Good morning, everyone. It's profoundly in your interests and your security and your future, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=14.88s)]
*  and the future of all your partners to release this money and let it through. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=21.6s)]
*  CBS News, intelligence and national security reporter Olivia Gasses has more from Washington. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=25.36s)]
*  Olivia, what came from the meeting today? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=32.96s)]
*  Sure, Liliya. So this is, of course, a meeting of the two top diplomats from among the world's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=35.76s)]
*  closest allies, very close partners who have an ongoing dialogue. But as you highlighted at the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=39.92s)]
*  top, chief among the concerns today was how to sustain support to Ukraine, both of them [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=44.4s)]
*  stressing that imperative of passing the 60 billion dollar supplemental that is still [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  languishing in the U.S. Congress. The foreign secretary said that in order for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=55.44s)]
*  Ukraine to reverse the losses that it sustained on the battlefield and reinvigorate its defenses [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  against Russia, that is an absolutely essential piece of aid. They also, of course, discussed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=68.72s)]
*  developments in Gaza and Israel, both of them acknowledging that some initial steps had been [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  taken by the Israeli government to boost the amount of humanitarian aid getting into the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=79.68s)]
*  enclave, but that more and more sustained actions are going to be necessary, crucial among them [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  opening up new crossings for aid to get through and establishing that deconfliction cell to better [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  coordinate with aid groups who are distributing that desperately needed aid across Gaza. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=95.2s)]
*  Question. Does Cameron's message have any impact on Congress and on lawmakers who are holding [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=100.48s)]
*  that aid? Sure. Well, he heads here from here at the State Department to meetings on Capitol Hill, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=107.2s)]
*  where he has a slate of meetings set up with senators and congressmen from both parties. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  He stressed at the presser here today that he's not here to lecture or cajole American policymakers [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=118.08s)]
*  about how to do their jobs, but again to highlight how profoundly in the U.S.'s interest it is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=122.88s)]
*  to put forward this support for Ukraine. It boosts the American industrial base and it [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=128.24s)]
*  sends an important message not only to Vladimir Putin about Western cohesion, but also to important [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=134.0s)]
*  onlookers, including North Korea, including Iran and including China, whose authoritarian leaders [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=140.72s)]
*  may be taking important lessons from not only what happens on the battlefield in Ukraine, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=147.36s)]
*  but the Western cohesion, the cohesion of the Western alliance that's backing him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=151.68s)]
*  Very quick about sending a message. Is it normal that he also met with Trump? Is that something [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=156.88s)]
*  that was to be expected before I let you go? He did stress that that was an important precedent. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=162.48s)]
*  He had previously met with Senator Romney, with Senator Obama in previous years. He highlighted [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  that Blinken had taken meetings with the British opposition leader, but he did not betray a whole [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=171.76s)]
*  lot of detail from his meeting with Mr. Trump, saying that it was private and they discussed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=176.56s)]
*  a range of international issues. Got it. Olivia, thanks so much. Thank you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_xP3RSb3w&t=179.92s)]
