# Poland in talks with U.S. about increasing troop presence, prime minister says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM)
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. President Biden heads to Poland this week, his second [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=0.0s)]
*  visit since Russia began its war in Ukraine. For more, we go now to Polish Prime Minister [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=9.36s)]
*  Mateusz Morawiecki. Good morning to you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=15.16s)]
*  Good morning. Good morning, ma'am. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=17.96s)]
*  So President Biden will be visiting Warsaw. We know you've said President Zelensky will [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  also be in Poland. What do you expect from these visits? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=25.64s)]
*  Well, I expect that there will be very strong confirmation of our resilience and our joint [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=29.68s)]
*  efforts to defeat Russia in Ukraine, because instead of saying, as some Western European [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=38.08s)]
*  politicians say, that Russia cannot be cannot win this war and Ukraine cannot be defeated, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=46.08s)]
*  we have to change the paradigm and we have to say Ukraine must win and Russia must be [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=53.2s)]
*  defeated. And I believe that the words of President Biden will reassure all Europe that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=59.6s)]
*  the United States is with us in this fight for freedom and peace. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=66.16s)]
*  It sounds like you're referring to the French president's recent comments. Does NATO actually [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  want Ukraine to win this war and regain its lost territory? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=76.16s)]
*  I believe so. I'm absolutely sure that this is the only way how we can restore peace and stability. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=81.2s)]
*  I cannot imagine that Putin and the Kremlin winning this war and then peace and stability [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=88.08s)]
*  is around us because the nature, the very nature of Russia is to conquer other countries. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=96.8s)]
*  Russia has actually summoned the worst of the 20th century, colonialism, imperialism, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=104.8s)]
*  nationalism. And this is the nature of the of Ruski Mir, as they call. And this is why [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=111.84s)]
*  it's such a critical moment in our history. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=118.96s)]
*  President Biden said he believes the war has to end in a negotiated settlement that's favorable [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=123.36s)]
*  to Ukraine. You said last year, Poland doesn't negotiate with criminals. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=128.32s)]
*  Nobody negotiated with Hitler. Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=134.0s)]
*  Are you saying peace is not possible if Putin stays in power? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=140.0s)]
*  I just came to hear this interview from Munich Conference. Munich Security Conference, very [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=143.92s)]
*  important platform to exchange opinions today. But in 1938, there was another Munich Conference [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=152.64s)]
*  where all the leaders of the Western world succumbed to Hitler and they believed they [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=159.84s)]
*  are bringing peace to their countries. And one year later, the Second World War broke out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=168.08s)]
*  We can, of course, negotiate, but it has to be under conditions [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=178.08s)]
*  and under the definition presented by Ukrainians themselves. It's up to them to define [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  what terms and conditions can be acceptable to negotiate with the Kremlin. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=189.44000000000003s)]
*  One of Ukraine's neighbors, Moldova, has warned that there is a plot to overthrow their government [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  and open a new front in the war. An ally of Putin recently said that Russia should denazify [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  and demilitarize Poland next. Do you see evidence that Russia is going to try to move into other [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=211.84s)]
*  countries, including yours? Yes, I do see lots of fingerprints of Russian forces, Russian services [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=218.16s)]
*  in Moldova. This is a very weak country and we all need to help them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=226.8s)]
*  But in terms of Poland, you are in NATO, so the United States would have to come to your defense [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=233.6s)]
*  if you went to NATO and asked for it. There are 11,000 U.S. service members on rotation in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=239.92s)]
*  Poland currently. I know your government's asking for more. Do you have any indications [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=245.6s)]
*  from the Biden administration that they will send more troops or make them permanent on your soil? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=250.48s)]
*  We are in the process of discussion with President Biden's administration about making their [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=256.08s)]
*  presence more permanent and increasing them. But I'm very grateful also for sending new [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=262.24s)]
*  patriot systems and other very modern weapons and munitions because this is also to some extent a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=270.16s)]
*  proxy for a presence of soldiers, but of course the two go in tandem. I also recall the words [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=277.76000000000005s)]
*  of President Biden from his last visit in Poland when he said that every inch or square inch [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=287.68s)]
*  of NATO's territory will be defended and Russia is not going to put any [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=298.96s)]
*  any inroads into those countries. I do believe that NATO countries, we are all very much secure, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=309.12s)]
*  but it's not only about us, it's also about creating stability around us in our direct [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=315.84s)]
*  neighborhood. If we fall to integrate Ukraine in NATO and the European Union, Ukraine will always [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=325.36s)]
*  be a buffer zone, which is not right. All right, Mr. Prime Minister, we'll be watching that visit. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=332.88s)]
*  Thank you for your time. Thank you. Thanks for having me. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcukCgxR6tM&t=339.6s)]
