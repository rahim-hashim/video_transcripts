# A look at Iran's presidential election
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck)
*  We're headed for a runoff between the two main candidates from this first round. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=0.0s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about them. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=7.68s)]
*  First of all, Mr. Jalili. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=9.36s)]
*  Well, Mr. Jalili, as it is being called, a hardliner, was a top negotiator long ago. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=11.36s)]
*  Nuclear negotiator. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=20.56s)]
*  Nuclear negotiator. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=21.56s)]
*  And he's being known because of his tough stand against the West. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=23.36s)]
*  So many people believe that he becomes the Iranian president, then Iran probably will [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=29.94s)]
*  have much more trouble with the West. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=36.660000000000004s)]
*  How does Mr. Jalili propose to fix the economy if it's not by trying to thaw things with [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=40.78s)]
*  the West and the U.S.? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  Well, he has promised many that they are going to rely on domestic, local resources rather [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=50.78s)]
*  than looking to the West to solve the problems, meaning that even if the nuclear deal is not [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=62.14s)]
*  renegotiated or done, still Iran can get along. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=68.94s)]
*  By being radically self-sufficient, a sort of a 100% made in Iran policy? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=75.58s)]
*  Yes, and also plus that Iran now has got many good and strong, powerful friends, Russia [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=83.5s)]
*  and China. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=92.3s)]
*  Iran really relies on its relationship and actually it is being called pivot to the East. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=94.3s)]
*  So Mr. Jalili would be comfortable looking for support to the East, especially Russia [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=100.78s)]
*  and China, and in effect turning his back on the West, America and Europe. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=109.62s)]
*  Well, Iranian officials, the whole administration, have said it is the West's fault because they [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=115.66s)]
*  see that it was the West that backed off from the deal. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=124.38s)]
*  But the deal did ease sanctions a little bit and life did improve somewhat. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=129.1s)]
*  How do they explain that? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=134.73999999999998s)]
*  As we know, Iran is divided. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  The point that you just mentioned is from the people who are a little bit disappointed [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=139.18s)]
*  with the administration and they want some changes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  And this is what Mr. Pesishkian, the other candidate, the moderate one, has promised [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=148.26s)]
*  people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=154.14s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about him. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=155.62s)]
*  Well, Mr. Pesishkian is a long-time member of parliament. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  He used to be for some time the minister of health, a heart surgeon himself, and he has [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=163.62s)]
*  promised to make relationship with the West a little bit better within the frame that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=171.94s)]
*  he can. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=178.5s)]
*  And he believes that there should be ease on many things like hijab or the other things [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=180.58s)]
*  that can make people's life easier. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=188.86s)]
*  So some people think or believe that he can deliver, but many also think that within the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=192.5s)]
*  framework of this present constitution, he will not be able to deliver many of those [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=199.86s)]
*  promises. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=208.02s)]
*  What power does the president actually have, given that the big national strategy is set [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=210.3s)]
*  by the supreme leader? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=217.3s)]
*  In Iran, a president is almost equal to a vice president in Western democracies. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=219.86s)]
*  So he cannot change foreign policy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=227.06s)]
*  He cannot change many things. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=230.46s)]
*  But in Iran, people believe that the one who implements those policies matters. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=233.82s)]
*  That is why they have gone for voting for this moderate candidate. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=241.45999999999998s)]
*  So the president can set the tone and has some limited administrative power, correct? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=247.14s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=256.3s)]
*  Does it matter to the average citizen who the president is? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=257.3s)]
*  Do you feel it in your life? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=261.26s)]
*  Well, as the nation is divided, some people think yes. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=263.94s)]
*  Maybe those who didn't participate in yesterday's election believe that no, it doesn't matter. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=270.42s)]
*  Whoever becomes the president, nothing will change. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=276.78s)]
*  That's some people say. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=279.62s)]
*  Now that this race has been distilled to two candidates, very different, opposite ends [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=281.82s)]
*  of the spectrum. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=288.5s)]
*  Is it likely to push all kinds of people to the polls for the second round? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=290.56s)]
*  I think that's the point that both candidates are counting on. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=297.46s)]
*  And as it is being said, Iranians are so unpredictable. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=302.94s)]
*  So who knows? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=309.22s)]
*  Next Friday, a lot of people might show up and then we'll decide who the next president [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=310.66s)]
*  is. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=316.62s)]
*  And it really can change, even a little, change the destination of the people of this country [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=318.02s)]
*  who desperately are actually asking for some changes. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=326.66s)]
*  Would you say that economic well-being is the number one issue for most voters? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=333.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=339.7s)]
*  I believe the economy is the first and most important matter for those people who go to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=340.78s)]
*  those polling stations. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=349.05999999999995s)]
*  They want to be able to put food on their tables, to be able to support their family, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=350.7s)]
*  to be able to support their children having education. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=357.21999999999997s)]
*  And also they want a little bit of ease on many strict and also quite hard rules, like [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=360.38s)]
*  the rules on women's covering, dress code, music. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=369.46s)]
*  There's a long list of such things that people want. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=376.26s)]
*  Does a president actually have the power to change those things or to adjust or to lighten [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=380.61999999999995s)]
*  the burden of the rules? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=389.34s)]
*  Well, many people believe yes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=391.21999999999997s)]
*  And of course there are things that cannot be changed. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=394.46s)]
*  Even a president wants to change it because we have a religion involved in these things. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=397.3s)]
*  Islamic Republic of Iran cannot denounce the hijab, but definitely implementation of that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=405.82s)]
*  rule will be different with a different person, different president in the office. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=412.54s)]
*  Stricter or not so strict? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=418.7s)]
*  It's a question of degree. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=420.14s)]
*  Yes, degree is stricter, not too much strict. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  So just allowing a little bit of dissent to show, a little bit of the people's demands [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=424.3s)]
*  and dissatisfaction to show is something a president could do as opposed to ordering [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=429.94s)]
*  a really harsh crackdown. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=436.54s)]
*  Yes, I think so. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=439.1s)]
*  Well, it's not expected that an ex-president can go and make friends with the U.S. or be [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=442.02s)]
*  an ally with the West, but definitely like little steps matter as it matters anywhere. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6dwsGvbck&t=448.7s)]
