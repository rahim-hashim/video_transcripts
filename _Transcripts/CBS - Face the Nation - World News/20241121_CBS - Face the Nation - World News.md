# ICC arrest warrant out for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, others
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s)
*  The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants Thursday against Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=0.0s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister, and the military chief for Hamas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=5.66s)]
*  The warrants accused the Israeli leaders of using starvation as a method of warfare in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=11.02s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=15.16s)]
*  The court also accused Hamas official Mohammed Daif of committing crimes against humanity [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=16.16s)]
*  on October 7, 2023. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=20.64s)]
*  Israel says it killed Daif in August, but the court could not confirm his death. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=23.72s)]
*  The White House National Security Council released a statement saying, quote, the United [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=28.36s)]
*  States fundamentally rejects the court's decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=32.06s)]
*  officials. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=37.44s)]
*  We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutors' rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=38.44s)]
*  process errors that led to this decision. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=42.54s)]
*  CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer has more from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=45.64s)]
*  Practically speaking, these arrest warrants could limit the prime minister and former [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=50.2s)]
*  defense minister's travel arrangements. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=54.84s)]
*  They stand to be arrested if they set foot in any of the 128 countries that are members [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  of the court. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  And that does include some U.S. allies, the U.K., France, Germany and Japan. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  But it does not include the U.S. itself or Israel. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=69.66s)]
*  The arrest warrants will also bolster Israel's critics around the world, who see the government's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=73.98s)]
*  military operations against Hamas as amounting to collective punishment against Palestinian [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=79.1s)]
*  civilians in Gaza. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=85.26s)]
*  And they may also further damage Israel's reputation internationally. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=87.26s)]
*  In the U.S., a National Security Council spokesman a short time ago said that the United States [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=92.3s)]
*  fundamentally rejects the court's decision to issue these arrest warrants for senior [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=97.18s)]
*  Israeli officials and referred to what it called troubling process orders. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  The council said it was discussing next steps with Israel, so we're waiting to hear what [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=109.14s)]
*  those will be. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=113.66s)]
*  The warrants may increase international pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to, say, improve the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=114.98s)]
*  delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza, something that is under consideration now as aid agencies [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=120.94s)]
*  have been ringing the alarm bells. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=126.98s)]
*  There's just not enough aid making it into Gaza now, and some of the trucks that do get [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=129.14s)]
*  across are being looted. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=133.74s)]
*  But inside Israel, these warrants may actually shore up Netanyahu's popularity, as Israelis [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=136.26s)]
*  will reject what they see as judgmental meddling in their affairs from abroad. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=141.86s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=147.82000000000002s)]
*  Elizabeth Palmer, thank you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=148.82000000000002s)]
*  For more analysis, John Alderman joins us now. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=149.98000000000002s)]
*  He's a senior vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Center for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=152.38000000000002s)]
*  Strategic and International Studies. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  John, I'm glad you're here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=158.54000000000002s)]
*  I want to dig into some of what Liz Palmer said. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=159.74s)]
*  I wonder if you can elaborate on her point about potential damage to Israel's reputation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  How could these warrants hurt Israel's standing in the international community? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=166.38000000000002s)]
*  Well, there are certainly a lot of countries, a lot of people in a lot of countries who [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=170.74s)]
*  think that Israel has been acting horribly in this war. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=174.74s)]
*  And they can say, look, here is an international court that agrees with us that what Netanyahu [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=179.14s)]
*  has been doing is criminal and should be prosecuted. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=185.54s)]
*  And for people who are critics of Israel, this validates their criticism. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=188.46s)]
*  For people who support Israel, this validates the Israeli criticism that everybody's biased [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=192.98s)]
*  against Israel, that there's profound anti-Semitism in international institutions. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=199.82000000000002s)]
*  And it really polarizes the situation rather than changes the situation in a constructive way. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, what about inside Israel? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=211.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean, do you see it having the opposite effect inside with these warrants helping [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=213.22s)]
*  Netanyahu's popularity and cachet among his own people? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=216.82000000000002s)]
*  There are certainly his political opponents who say this is a mark on the morality of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=222.10000000000002s)]
*  Israel, but for many of his political supporters, and I think a lot of Israelis who are sort [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=227.54s)]
*  of feeling in the middle, they are feeling isolated in the world. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=232.14s)]
*  They feel the world didn't care that 1200 Israelis were massacred on October 7th, 2023, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=235.74s)]
*  and that there is the double standard where Jewish lives are cheap. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=243.02s)]
*  And when Jews protect themselves, the world rises up, but didn't rise up during the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=247.5s)]
*  Holocaust and World War Two. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=253.14s)]
*  So I think for a lot of Israelis, there really is this sense of isolation and the ICC arrest [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=254.62s)]
*  warrants add to that isolation and make Israelis rally around Netanyahu to say we have to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=262.34000000000003s)]
*  defend ourselves ourselves. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=271.1s)]
*  The U.S. is sticking by Israel. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=272.94s)]
*  Could the U.S. face backlash from any allies for criticizing the International Criminal [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=274.54s)]
*  Court? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=278.46000000000004s)]
*  I've certainly spoken to people who said the U.S. has to be careful. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=279.82s)]
*  The U.S. has to worry about seeming like it's really out of the mainstream. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=282.74s)]
*  U.S. certainly cast the veto in the U.N. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=289.7s)]
*  Security Council about a ceasefire resolution yesterday because it didn't require the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=291.86s)]
*  return of hostages. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=298.18s)]
*  So I think the Biden administration is certainly comfortable with it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=299.66s)]
*  The Trump administration even more comfortable standing by Israel against international [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=302.86s)]
*  criticism. Whether that will lead to greater global isolation as a consequence is something [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=307.94s)]
*  we're going to have to see. But it seems to me that that standing by Israel at this moment, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=313.17999999999995s)]
*  rather than a break with the future, is probably foreshadowing what will be even more of a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=317.62s)]
*  future going forward. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=322.73999999999995s)]
*  Israel says that it killed the Hamas military leader in July, but the court wasn't able to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=324.14s)]
*  confirm that. Is that a misstep for the court if no living Hamas officials are being charged? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=328.26s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=335.62s)]
*  I'm not sure that they could really find somebody responsible at this point because Israel [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=337.54s)]
*  has done so many operations against so many leaders of Hamas and other organizations that [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=343.78000000000003s)]
*  target Israel. Their complaint is really not that it needs to be even handed. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=350.78000000000003s)]
*  Their complaint is that they are fighting for their survival. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=356.26s)]
*  That puts them in a different situation. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  It is unfair to criticize them for defending themselves against people who want to eradicate [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=362.22s)]
*  them. Of course, the charge that the other side wants to eradicate us is true on both [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=369.22s)]
*  the Palestinian side and the Israeli side, which is one of the reasons this is such a [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=374.1s)]
*  difficult conflict and one that's gotten much, much more difficult to solve. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=377.86s)]
*  John Ultraman, thank you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=381.82000000000005s)]
*  Thank you, Lindsay. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBrJqxIyk5s&t=383.98s)]
