# On the ground in Gaza as the war between Israel and Hamas rages on
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE)
*  We're over 100 days into a war that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=0.0s)]
*  to continue. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=4.48s)]
*  CBS's Charlie Dagata accompanied the Israeli military into Gaza and filed this. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=6.08s)]
*  We crossed into southern Gaza through the same breach in the fence that Hamas militants [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  punched through to launch their rampage, where soldiers of the 55th Brigade, 98th Paratroopers [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=18.04s)]
*  Division showed us a discovery they had made. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  A soldier kept his rifle pointed straight into the darkness down the shaft. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  Of the hundreds of miles of tunnels beneath Gaza, this one enabled Hamas fighters to infiltrate [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  under open fields undetected, planned long in advance. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  Made combat patrol here and he found the hole. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=44.64s)]
*  The hole was here, very small one, with the leather. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=49.16s)]
*  They're finding tunnels and shafts like this everywhere, but this is just a few hundred [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=53.2s)]
*  yards from the crossing itself and they believe it was used by Hamas militants to attack that day. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=58.6s)]
*  We pushed deeper into the territory toward the besieged city of Khan Yunus, witnessing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=66.0s)]
*  scenes of utter devastation following weeks of heavy bombardment that have not only leveled [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=71.08s)]
*  nearly every building here, it's taken a horrific toll on the civilian population. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=76.92s)]
*  The largest city in southern Gaza is still thought to be a Hamas stronghold, where militant [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=83.48s)]
*  leader Yahya Sinwar is, or was, hiding out. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=88.72s)]
*  Hamas health officials say the death toll has now soared to more than 26,000, among [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  them more than 10,000 children. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=98.4s)]
*  We came to what used to be an elementary school in this upscale neighborhood, once a Hamas [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  fighting position we were told, now an Israeli military base. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  A few moments ago there was a loud explosion and now the skies are filled with smoke. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  It just gives you an indication of first of all how close you are to Khan Yunus itself [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=115.64s)]
*  and how this battle is raging on. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=119.28s)]
*  We later learned that was a controlled explosion of a building to deny Hamas gunmen places [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=121.48s)]
*  to take cover and counterattack. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=126.92s)]
*  It's more than just urban warfare, says Lieutenant Colonel Anshee. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  They dressed with civilian clothing, so it was very difficult to be identified. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=133.6s)]
*  They move without their ammunition and they collect it wherever they, when they pop out [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=138.0s)]
*  from their underground infrastructure and then they shoot at us. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=141.64s)]
*  They try to shoot and run away. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=145.92s)]
*  The Israeli military say they've got Khan Yunus surrounded, yet Hamas leaders and the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=147.6s)]
*  more than 130 hostages still being held are yet to be found. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=152.48s)]
*  Driving back through the destruction, the challenge is not just about seizing territory [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=158.28s)]
*  above ground, but hunting down what's below. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=163.16s)]
*  Charlie Daggett has just returned to London from reporting in the region. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=168.12s)]
*  Charlie, journalists are not permitted into Gaza to freely report on the war and that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=172.04s)]
*  has been the subject of court cases in Israel. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=177.12s)]
*  So what restrictions did the IDF put on you? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah Margaret, we cannot get into Gaza from Israel or from Egypt for that matter because [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=183.48s)]
*  the Israelis are holding all the cards. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=189.6s)]
*  The only way you can get in is with the Israeli military on an embed. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=191.24s)]
*  What those restrictions mean is obviously by virtue of the fact that they're the ones [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=196.28s)]
*  who are showing you around, then they create the narrative of what you can see. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  In that particular one, we were there for maybe two, two and a half hours. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=202.8s)]
*  We weren't allowed to broadcast it for 24, 48 hours or even talk about it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=207.36s)]
*  There are embargo restrictions. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=212.48s)]
*  In some cases they want to see the material, but we never have it censored as such. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=214.12s)]
*  They never tell us to change the shots. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  It has to do with security issues. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=220.48s)]
*  This time they didn't ask to see it at all. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=222.64s)]
*  The difficult part is that we don't have any, we're not free to roam. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=226.08s)]
*  We're not free to get any of our own material or access and speak to anybody else there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  This is the third embed that I've had. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=236.28s)]
*  I haven't seen a single Palestinian. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=239.0s)]
*  I haven't seen any sign of life or death. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=241.12s)]
*  Haven't been able to get to any of these humanitarian centers or hospitals. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=243.96s)]
*  So it's been impossible for us to independently report what's going on there aside from the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=248.10000000000002s)]
*  incredibly courageous work of our colleagues inside Gaza. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  Indeed, our producer Marwan Al Ghul and those people living in the middle of this fight. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  But you have been in Israel for what the better part of three weeks. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=263.47999999999996s)]
*  And in that time there has been growing international pressure, including this ruling by [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=267.28s)]
*  the International Court of Justice ordering Israel to prevent acts of genocide, but [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=272.64s)]
*  stopping short of calling for an immediate ceasefire. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  I wonder what the soldiers you met with think of all this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=280.88s)]
*  Are they feeling fatigued? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=285.56s)]
*  There's definitely fatigue there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=288.36s)]
*  But as for the ruling itself, obviously soldiers never comment on government policy or politics. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=290.56s)]
*  When you ask them about civilian casualties, certainly genocide, they said they're doing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=296.96s)]
*  everything they can to avoid it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=301.36s)]
*  But Hamas hides in schools, hospitals, tunnels. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  And many Israelis, or there were many examples of Israeli soldiers shooting unarmed civilians, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=305.32s)]
*  even Israeli hostages in one case. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=310.88s)]
*  As for Israel itself, the country is kind of split. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=314.04s)]
*  Those who back Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who slammed those charges of genocide as [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=317.88s)]
*  outrageous and are looking for total victory, and the others who say, look, enough is enough. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=323.2s)]
*  We need to stop this. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  At least get a ceasefire in there. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  At least get the hostages out and at least discuss some kind of endgame. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=331.28s)]
*  Charlie, important reporting and thank you for your context. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=336.11999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxRjIa15zlE&t=340.15999999999997s)]
