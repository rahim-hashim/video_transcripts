# How Trump's tariffs could impact construction costs for Americans
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk)
*  All right, we're going to stay on top of the tariffs and what they mean for you and your wallet bottom line. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News business contributor Javier David. Javier, great to be with you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=5.5s)]
*  OK, so if I'm somebody that wants to do some home construction, if I'm looking or maybe I'm in the middle of home construction right now, budget is a big deal. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=10.0s)]
*  How big a deal is this for people who are looking to remodel their homes or maybe build a home right now? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=19.3s)]
*  Is it going to be twice as expensive? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=24.8s)]
*  It's well, maybe not twice as expensive, but it's going to be materially expensive. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=27.2s)]
*  And the gentleman that you just had on really laid it all out. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=30.4s)]
*  Just expect higher costs across the board. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=33.9s)]
*  Potentially, this is an industry that's kind of already under pressure on multiple fronts. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=35.9s)]
*  The interest rates of curtailed home buying and building activity, the mass deportation effort threatens a large pool of labor. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=39.7s)]
*  And now you have these tariffs to contend with and they're just put higher costs on imported goods and materials. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=46.2s)]
*  Residential construction uses a lot of material from China, Mexico, Canada, all of which, of course, are in the Trump administration's crosshairs. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=52.7s)]
*  So this impacts a lot of a range of goods. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=59.7s)]
*  And there's very little reasons to believe that companies won't pass those costs along to consumers, which just means more inflationary pressure. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=62.7s)]
*  Yes. So how quickly could we see these prices start to go up? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=69.0s)]
*  I mean, is it as soon as this week? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=71.9s)]
*  It could be because I think what the fear is, is some of these countries will implement sort of the tit for tat tariffs. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=74.4s)]
*  They will like implement their own actions against it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=81.1s)]
*  So you could see costs immediately. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=85.1s)]
*  It takes a little time usually to trickle into the system. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=86.69999999999999s)]
*  But, you know, certainly within a month, you can start seeing those prices impact. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=89.5s)]
*  You know, we've seen tariffs also throwing global financial markets into chaos today. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  But what does that really mean for the average American? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=98.5s)]
*  Are they going to feel it right now? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  I mean, not just with home building, but for other ways to the trickle down effect? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=104.3s)]
*  Well, they'll be looking at it on screens and shows like this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=108.3s)]
*  But my favorite piece of advice during times like these, don't look at your 401k. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  It's a short term volatility event. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=116.3s)]
*  It'll make you emotional, emotional investing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  Never a good idea. Just write it out. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=120.7s)]
*  Don't sell anything. Save as much as you can and just pay down those credit cards because those interest rates really will start to bite. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=122.6s)]
*  All right, Javier David, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGsjtikXttk&t=129.6s)]
