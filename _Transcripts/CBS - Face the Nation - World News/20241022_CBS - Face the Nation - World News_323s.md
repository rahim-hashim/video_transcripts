# What to know about Alexey Navalny's posthumous memoir
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58)
*  The posthumous memoir of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been released eight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=0.0s)]
*  months after he died in prison at the age of 47. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=4.92s)]
*  Navalny originally began writing Patriot as an autobiography in 2020 after he was poisoned [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=8.86s)]
*  and attacked many blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for, but he has denied involvement. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=14.52s)]
*  Before Navalny could finish the manuscript, he was arrested in Russia in 2021. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=19.88s)]
*  Navalny was an anti-corruption activist, politician and attorney who became a prominent figure [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=24.92s)]
*  in the Russian opposition movement after Putin was re-elected in 2012. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=29.98s)]
*  Russian officials said Navalny died of natural causes and U.S. intelligence earlier this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=34.46s)]
*  year said Putin probably didn't order his death. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=38.66s)]
*  Navalny's wife Yulia Navalny spoke to 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl about how she felt [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  while reading her husband's memoir. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  He said it was a dog house and this is the place where prisoners were sent to be tortured [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=49.32s)]
*  and raped and sometimes murdered. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  I wondered how you read those passages. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=58.26s)]
*  I was thinking of you when I read it and thought what is she feeling? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=61.86s)]
*  How are you reading this? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=65.88s)]
*  It's very tough moment for him to think about all these torturing place and torturing conditions [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=67.3s)]
*  and about him how he was laughing at these people even while he was there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=75.5s)]
*  For more on this let's bring in Alexandra Alter. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=85.74s)]
*  She's a reporter for the New York Times who covers books. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=88.14s)]
*  Alexandra, we have this book in front of us here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=91.14s)]
*  Such a fascinating, incredible read. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=93.98s)]
*  What in there surprised you if you can even sum it up? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=96.9s)]
*  Well, it's such an astonishing kind of document and piece of his legacy but what really surprised [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=99.94s)]
*  me was to hear his voice and to see his personality and sense of humor still intact in these really [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  horrific conditions in prison. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=112.84s)]
*  He's such a charismatic public figure but you really see him wrestling as a human with [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=115.02s)]
*  the fact that he's separated from his wife and children and probably will never see them [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=120.34s)]
*  again. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=123.69999999999999s)]
*  That his entire, the cause that he's devoted his life to, you know, Putin has imprisoned [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=124.69999999999999s)]
*  him and might end up silencing him. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=130.3s)]
*  So it's really crushing in some ways but it's also very inspiring. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=133.44s)]
*  It's very funny. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=137.74s)]
*  In one moment he'll talk about these horrible work shifts that he's on. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  In the next minute he'll joke and make fun of the guards or talk about something funny [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=142.62s)]
*  that another inmate did. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=147.38s)]
*  So it's astonishing to see somebody go through what he did and to remain cheerful and hopeful [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  really about the future of Russia. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=156.18s)]
*  How do you think he was able to remain hopeful and have that humor knowing he's going to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=157.66s)]
*  miss his kid's graduation? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  He's not going to meet his grandchildren? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=164.62s)]
*  He talks about that in very frank terms and really wrestles with it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=167.78s)]
*  He says like it's sometimes he wants to scream, he wants to smash things. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=171.38s)]
*  He's brought to tears at times but he really, I think, loved what he did with his life and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=175.26s)]
*  was willing to pay the ultimate price. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=180.54s)]
*  And he knew when he went back to Russia that this was likely the outcome. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=182.84s)]
*  He writes about that in the book, that decision to go from Berlin to Moscow knowing that he [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=186.14s)]
*  would probably be arrested upon arriving and thinking it's better for him to spend his [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=190.38s)]
*  life imprisoned in Russia, in his country, which he loved with the, with his fellow citizens [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  than as a leader in exile. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=199.52s)]
*  It's interesting because Julia was asked that as well by Leslie Stahl and her answer was [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=201.68s)]
*  basically there, you know, it wasn't for me to choose. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=206.48s)]
*  He had made up his decision and there was, there was no other decision. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=209.0s)]
*  She had also told Leslie Stahl that he was able to essentially cleverly smuggle these [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=212.6s)]
*  journal entries out via court proceedings and that there are diary entries from the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=217.68s)]
*  first year of imprisonment, a little bit less in the second year and then none from that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=224.12s)]
*  third year. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=227.84s)]
*  Is that sort of indicative that the surveillance was becoming more intense? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=228.84s)]
*  Is that indicative of his health degrading or just fewer court appearances? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=233.68s)]
*  I think it's an indicative of how difficult it became for him to write in prison. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=238.0s)]
*  He talks about only having a pen and paper for an hour sometimes. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=242.0s)]
*  Then it became half an hour. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=245.76s)]
*  We can assume it became less time. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=247.2s)]
*  They were definitely cracking down on his communications. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=249.7s)]
*  He had fewer phone calls with family. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=253.16s)]
*  They were reading all of his correspondence. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=255.0s)]
*  He writes about how some of the material was actually confiscated and never returned. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=256.44s)]
*  And Yulia told me that after his death, they didn't receive any of his belongings. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=260.84s)]
*  So it's possible that there was a good deal more writing and that he would have had published [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=264.84s)]
*  if he could have. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=269.96s)]
*  However, he was able to continue posting on social media until shortly before his death. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=270.96s)]
*  So he did, he was very sort of clever about getting his communications out and staying [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=274.64s)]
*  connected with his supporters. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=279.28s)]
*  What happens to his political movement now? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=281.12s)]
*  This is a great question. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=283.96s)]
*  The Russian opposition movement, his death has been a huge setback. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  He was probably their most prominent leader, certainly globally. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=288.68s)]
*  And now many members of his organization are in exile. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  Many Russian opposition leaders are trying to work from exile. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  And his wife, Yulia, now feels the responsibility to carry on his movement. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=299.32s)]
*  And she feels the responsibility both as the person who loved Navalny, but also as a citizen [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  of Russia who hopes to go back one day. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=309.4s)]
*  And she told me, you know, it's really difficult to lead an opposition movement from exile. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=312.2s)]
*  That was exactly the reason that he wanted to return. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=316.32s)]
*  Alexandra Alter of the New York Times, thank you for your time tonight. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=319.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOlbFGhC58&t=321.96s)]
