# U.S. calling for deescalation in Syria as rebels advance on Homs
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM)
*  Thousands of people have been forced to leave parts of central Syria as rebel forces advance [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=0.0s)]
*  on the country's third largest city, Homs. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=4.76s)]
*  It would be a major win for the rebels, who have also captured the country's largest [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=8.3s)]
*  city of Aleppo. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad has promised to push back the insurgent forces, but so [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=13.96s)]
*  far the military has struggled to do so. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=18.36s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd joins us now for our weekly national [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=21.28s)]
*  security wrap-up. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=25.78s)]
*  So Sam, let's start with Syria. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=26.78s)]
*  Does the U.S. see this as good news that the rebels are making this type of progress? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=29.2s)]
*  What are their ultimate goals? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=34.4s)]
*  The U.S. is actually calling for all parties, both Bashar al-Assad and the opposition group [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=36.72s)]
*  known as Hayat Tahrir al-Shamz, to de-escalate the situation and to turn to negotiations. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=42.56s)]
*  So the United States is not celebrating this as a victory. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=48.96s)]
*  That is because since this war began back in 2011 after a popular uprising against Bashar [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=52.72s)]
*  al-Assad, a range of opposition groups have materialized. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=58.92s)]
*  This particular opposition group, Hayat Tahrir al-Shamz, is a designated foreign terrorist [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=62.84s)]
*  organization. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=68.28s)]
*  It is an offshoot of an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria and is therefore no friend to the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=69.28s)]
*  United States and poses a threat to U.S. interests. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=74.56s)]
*  However, this opposition group and the United States to ultimately share one goal, which [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=78.44s)]
*  is for Bashar al-Assad to leave power. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=83.16s)]
*  However, again, the United States is urging a negotiated settlement and a de-escalation [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=85.48s)]
*  in the fighting. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=90.84s)]
*  At the same time, the United States does maintain about a thousand troops in Syria. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=91.84s)]
*  They're focused primarily on countering ISIS and are not authorized to fight Bashar al-Assad. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=97.08s)]
*  So this is a complicated situation, Lana, and one that does not have any easy answers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  Very complicated. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=108.2s)]
*  We appreciate you helping to make it a little bit more clear for all of us. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=109.2s)]
*  Let's talk now about South Korea. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=112.72s)]
*  I mean, these headlines, the images we saw coming out of one of the U.S.'s major allies [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=114.92s)]
*  this week was mind boggling. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=120.48s)]
*  Talk to us about what's happening now to President Yun, obviously intense backlash over his six-hour [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=123.92s)]
*  declaration of martial law. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  What is next for this major U.S. ally? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=133.22s)]
*  Very ill-planned and ill-executed declaration of martial law. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=136.44s)]
*  President Yun is now facing calls for his impeachment by officials across the country, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=140.08s)]
*  including from his own party. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=144.32s)]
*  There will be a vote in South Korea's National Assembly on whether to impeach President [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=146.12s)]
*  Yun on Saturday evening. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  If there is a vote to impeach him, the Constitutional Court in South Korea will then take up a decision [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=152.22s)]
*  about whether to ask him to resign. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=157.92s)]
*  In the interim, it is worth noting the South Korean military has said that they will not [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=160.26s)]
*  heed any additional orders to impose martial law. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=164.6s)]
*  So very busy few days in South Korea and very important vote on President Yun's impeachment [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=168.2s)]
*  on Saturday evening. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=173.84s)]
*  All right, Sam Vinograd, thank you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=174.84s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9i4s2IQ-xM&t=176.84s)]
