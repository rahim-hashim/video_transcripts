# 3 truckloads of aid from Red Cross has gotten into Gaza today, director-general says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q)
*  We turn now to Robert Mardini. He's the Director General of the International Committee of the Red Cross and he joins us from Geneva [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning to you, sir. How much aid have you been able to get into Gaza today? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  Good morning Margaret, so [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=18.92s)]
*  Today we were able to get three additional trucks in of medicines [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=21.16s)]
*  War-wounded kits so surgical equipment for hospital [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=26.36s)]
*  They are badly needed as well as some water and sanitation equipment. They come on top of six trucks that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=29.24s)]
*  Passed on Friday. This is good. This is positive [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=37.84s)]
*  But this is a drop in an ocean of need and of course [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=42.72s)]
*  Is only a small fraction of what the Gaza Strip and Gazans need today [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=46.84s)]
*  We just heard on our program from a Republican senator who said that he does not [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=52.94s)]
*  Trust that USAID that is provided to international organizations [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  Like yours can actually make it to the people of Gaza and not end up in the hands of terrorists [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  How do you account for that? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=69.58s)]
*  Well as a as a neutral impartial humanitarian organization that has been present in the Gaza Strip for [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=75.7s)]
*  Decades now we work in a direct implementation mode [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=82.46s)]
*  we have our own staff delivering aid and services to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=87.1s)]
*  to individuals that are [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  carefully vetted to institutions such as hospitals such as the Sifa Hospital where our [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=94.34s)]
*  surgeon very often operate hand-in-hand with [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  Palestinian surgeons and our partners from the Palestine Red Crescent Society [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=104.54s)]
*  So we have very robust and rigorous checks in place to prevent [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=108.26s)]
*  And to ensure rather that the aid goes to the right persons who those who need it the most [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=114.66s)]
*  This morning the Palestinian Red Crescent that you just mentioned said they received threats and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=120.86s)]
*  Needed to evacuate the hospital they were told because it was going to be bombarded [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=127.66s)]
*  Did Israel inform your partners of this? What is happening? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=132.38s)]
*  Well these orders of evacuation [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=138.74s)]
*  Happening in the Gaza Strip are of course problematic for us this hospital Al Quds [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=142.62s)]
*  has close to 400 [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=148.22s)]
*  Patients most of them severely injured [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=150.94s)]
*  There are thousands of civilians taking shelter in hospitals hospitals are protected by the laws of war by international [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=154.22s)]
*  Humanitarian law under no circumstances hospital should be bombed under no circumstance [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=162.22s)]
*  A patient should die in a hospital bed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=168.26s)]
*  And it is very difficult to evacuate hospitals [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=171.7s)]
*  Imagine babies in incubators you cannot unplug this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=175.74s)]
*  Imagine people [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=181.42s)]
*  Getting oxygen you cannot just evacuate this unless there is a feasible and viable alternative [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=183.42s)]
*  To this and today this alternative simply does not exist in the Gaza Strip [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=189.78s)]
*  And let's remind that it is the obligation of parties to the conflict to ensure that basic services [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=194.54s)]
*  For the civilian population are covered at all times and the burden should not go to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=201.22s)]
*  Organizations such as us or the Palestine Red Crescent Society [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=207.1s)]
*  You are neutral you are in contact with Hamas on Friday there had been high pressure [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  On Friday there had been high hopes for a humanitarian hostage release [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=218.34s)]
*  There wasn't one [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=223.54s)]
*  Do you still believe that one is possible? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=225.34s)]
*  Let me just start by saying that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=232.89999999999998s)]
*  To the to the families of hostages that the plight of their loved ones is one of our top priorities that we are in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=235.5s)]
*  conversation with Hamas with Israeli officials and with other others to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=242.78s)]
*  Ensure their safe release we have been [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=248.34s)]
*  also proposing to visit [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=252.78s)]
*  hostages in order to ensure that they get personal medicines or [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=255.34s)]
*  Simply that they can exchange messages with their loved ones and of course we stand ready to facilitate any [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=260.38s)]
*  Release hoping that this will happen so far [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=267.58s)]
*  we were able to facilitate the release of four hostages and we stand ready to do more as [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=271.02s)]
*  As soon as parties negotiate an agreement [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=277.42s)]
*  Well, we hope for all of those hostage families that there is one. Thank you very much for your time today [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYaWFqD73Q&t=281.42s)]
