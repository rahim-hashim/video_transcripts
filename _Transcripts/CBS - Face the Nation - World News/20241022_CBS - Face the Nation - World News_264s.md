# Significance of BRICS Summit that Putin is hosting in Russia
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI)
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin is hosting a gathering of world leaders for what's known as the BRICS Summit of Emerging Economies today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=0.0s)]
*  This comes amid Western sanctions and an international arrest warrant which followed Moscow's invasion of Ukraine back in 2022, you may remember. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=7.5s)]
*  Now, the BRICS group, which initially included only Russia, Brazil, India, China, and South Africa, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=16.3s)]
*  has expanded to the countries you see kind of in an orange-yellow there, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=23.7s)]
*  An invitation to join has also been extended to Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=30.2s)]
*  The group accounts for 45% of the world's population and 35% of global economic output. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=33.9s)]
*  So for more on today's summit, I want to bring in Valerie Hopkins. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=40.8s)]
*  She's an international correspondent with the New York Times, and as you see, she's joining us from Russia. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=43.9s)]
*  Help us understand the significance of this summit. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=49.6s)]
*  We just laid across some of the bullet points there, but why the US, especially, and other allies should pay attention to what's happening where you are. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=51.8s)]
*  Good morning, Erlen. Thanks for having me on your show. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=62.0s)]
*  I mean, as you've already said, Putin has brought together representatives of the countries that generate 35% of the global economic output by purchasing power parity and 40% of the recent GDP growth. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=64.3s)]
*  So, you know, while the West tried by slapping unprecedented sanctions on the Russian government and on Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=79.2s)]
*  this is Putin's moment to show that he's not isolated, that he is meeting with representatives of 45% of the world's population, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=89.7s)]
*  and that the West cannot, you know, that he believes that the West cannot actually defeat Russia or, you know, impose its vision on the world and its world order. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, this is taking place at a time when the global South is also incredibly frustrated with Western policy on the police, on the war in Israel and Gaza, and Putin is really trying to capitalize on that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=111.1s)]
*  He's not allowed to travel to many countries in the world and has kept a lot of his trips to a minimum for since the coronavirus pandemic and later, you know, since the ICC issued a warrant for his arrest. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=127.6s)]
*  So here he's able to have almost 20 bilateral meetings where the Chinese president, the president of Iran, South Africa, India, and a whole host of global leaders. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=140.0s)]
*  And I think he's trying to project domestically and internationally that he's not going anywhere. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=152.3s)]
*  And so it seems as though based on everything you've just laid out that Putin may not be able to head into the world, but the world can come to him. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=158.5s)]
*  What's at the top of the agenda for him? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=167.2s)]
*  What is he trying to specifically accomplish? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=169.3s)]
*  Well, one of the biggest priorities of this summit and of this group, especially, you know, with Russia in charge of it right now, is trying to reform the global financial system. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=172.2s)]
*  So it's still probably very far off, but BRICS leaders are talking about creating an alternative to the swift system of global payments. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=182.5s)]
*  They want to, most countries have been afraid to do bilateral trade with Russia because of secondary sanctions that may be slapped on them by the West. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=190.89999999999998s)]
*  But if they were to join together in a parallel alternative to the swift system, that would greatly increase Russia's ability to trade and to continue to prosecute war on Ukraine. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=200.1s)]
*  They're also quite united in their wishes to de-dollarize the global economy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=214.5s)]
*  So a previous proposal floated at other BRICS summits was to create a sort of alternative currency. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=221.0s)]
*  I think that's not currently on the table, but there is a lot of interest in this payment system in an alternative really to global governance. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=226.7s)]
*  I mean, countries like Brazil, for instance, who have condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine are still very eager to see the way the world is governed transformed. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=237.0s)]
*  They're not satisfied with the way the UN Security Council system works, for instance. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=247.6s)]
*  Well, Valerie, I appreciate all of those details. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=252.10000000000002s)]
*  We're just out of time, but it really is a fascinating moment. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=255.5s)]
*  And I really appreciate you joining us to give us at least an overview of everything happening there. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  Valerie Hopkins, thank you so much. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtqWJmZTaI&t=262.40000000000003s)]
