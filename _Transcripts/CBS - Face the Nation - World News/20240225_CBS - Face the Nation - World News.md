# Russian President Vladimir Putin has "created a martyr" in Alexey Navalny, Fiona Hill says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg)
*  We're back with former White House Russia expert Fiona Hill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=4.16s)]
*  Thanks, Margaret. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=5.16s)]
*  Yesterday, the body of opposition leader Alexei Navalny was handed over to his mother after [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=6.16s)]
*  she had asked for more than a week to have him released, his corpse released. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Why do you think Vladimir Putin changed his mind and let it happen? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=16.46s)]
*  I think actually he realized he'd gone far too far. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=19.6s)]
*  He was starting to get protests even from Russian Orthodox priests. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=23.18s)]
*  I mean, Putin prides himself on being this great religious leader of extolling Christian [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=26.16s)]
*  values. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=31.44s)]
*  So there were Russian Orthodox priests saying that Putin was worse than Pontius Pilate in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=32.44s)]
*  the Bible for denying the mother and the family the body, all kinds of celebrities. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=36.32s)]
*  And of course, there was quite a bit of revulsion about this as well, because Navalny's mother, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=41.24s)]
*  a very brave woman, actually went onto YouTube, which can still be seen inside of Russia as [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  well, and basically pointing out that Putin or the Kremlin or the prison authorities were [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=52.2s)]
*  all acting against the law by not handing over the body. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=57.0s)]
*  They were violating even their own norms and terms. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=60.56s)]
*  And I think that really got a reaction, because people will look at the mother for who she [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=63.36s)]
*  is, the actual mother of someone who has died, not a political person until that moment. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=68.68s)]
*  And I think it was really escalating out of control in terms of the message that the Kremlin [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=73.36s)]
*  was trying to enforce. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  It was making it a very big deal. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=80.6s)]
*  The question now will be about the funeral, because, of course, what she said very openly [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  was they were blackmailing her to have a secret funeral, so not to have the traditional Russian [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=86.24s)]
*  public viewing of the body and then basically a commemoration at the graveside. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=92.24s)]
*  So it's going to be a question now about what they allow to happen next. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  And he created a martyr. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=103.24s)]
*  He did. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=104.24s)]
*  He has created a martyr. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=105.24s)]
*  Absolutely right. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=106.24s)]
*  This past week, though, we saw not only the victory in eastern Ukraine, you saw the death [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=107.64s)]
*  of Alexei Navalny. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=111.84s)]
*  You saw Russia take another American prisoner because she donated 50 bucks to a Ukrainian [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=113.04s)]
*  charity. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=117.92s)]
*  He seems very emboldened right now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=118.92s)]
*  He is. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=120.76s)]
*  And I mean, that really fits into the whole theme of your discussions this morning. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=121.76s)]
*  Putin thinks that he's winning because we've blinked, because we don't seem to have the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=125.72s)]
*  courage, either politically or morally right now, to stand up and support Ukraine in fending [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=130.12s)]
*  him off and fending Russia off. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=137.23999999999998s)]
*  He's also basically a month away for his re-annointment. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=139.2s)]
*  I can't really call it an election as the president of Russia. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=142.0s)]
*  And Putin's basically saying, you're going to have me until 2036 because he can have [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  two more six-year terms. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=149.16s)]
*  And I'm so much in control of this situation that I can do literally whatever I like. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  He's trying to intimidate everyone and to basically remove any sense of hope whatsoever. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  And these targeting of a young woman who's given 50 bucks, I mean, that's actually fairly [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  ridiculous, but the whole message of it is to say, I'm in business any kind of dissent, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=166.96s)]
*  no matter how minor, will be punished with the full weight of the state behind it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=171.88s)]
*  Well, we're in the middle of an election in this country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  You worked for Donald Trump when he was in office. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=180.12s)]
*  He has continued to call himself a political dissident. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=182.88s)]
*  He actually compared himself to Alexei Navalny. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  It's a lot of a lot of no. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=190.72s)]
*  It is a form of Navalny. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=191.72s)]
*  It is a form of communism or fascism. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=194.08s)]
*  He's talking about legal cases against him. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=198.68s)]
*  He's talking about Russia quite a lot on the campaign trail again. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=202.4s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=206.0s)]
*  Well, there's a couple of things. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=207.0s)]
*  I mean, first of all, former President Trump has made it very clear that he admires Vladimir [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=208.0s)]
*  Putin. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=212.44s)]
*  I mean, he continues to really extol him, despite all of the evidence to the contrary [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=213.44s)]
*  should be here that Putin is an avowed enemy at this particular point of the United States. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=221.28s)]
*  I mean, he's openly declared war in the United States. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=225.6s)]
*  He's taking American citizens hostage. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=228.08s)]
*  It's not just the young woman who was recently taken, who's a dual citizen, but it's also [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=231.04s)]
*  Evan Gershkovitz in The Wall Street Journal. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=235.6s)]
*  It's also Paul Whelan, the former Marine who was taken years ago. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=237.44s)]
*  President Trump actually ought to have a sense of responsibility about American citizens. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=242.12s)]
*  And instead, you know, what he's doing in the most brazen and frankly shameful fashion [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=245.6s)]
*  is trying to suggest that the United States is like Putin's Russia. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, since when have we been assassinating our opposition candidates in this country? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  Since when have presidents of the United States been wanting to take out political opponents [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=259.44s)]
*  through poisoning or through imprisoning them in, you know, basically the equivalent of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=264.24s)]
*  Arctic penal colonies? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  So what President Trump is doing is degrading the United States. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=269.68s)]
*  I just don't understand how people don't call him out for this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  We hear from Trump supporters at rallies, though, questions about aid to Ukraine. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=276.72s)]
*  Is what he is talking about, is he planting seeds that last, even if Joe Biden wins the election? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=282.88s)]
*  Of course he is. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=288.64s)]
*  And he's also, frankly, parroting the kind of propaganda that we've been having coming [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=289.64s)]
*  out of Russia for more than a decade now. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=293.04s)]
*  I mean, since Russia first made moves against Ukraine, which goes back a considerable period [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=295.56s)]
*  of time to cut offs of their gas back in 2006, for example, the annexation of Crimea [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=301.14s)]
*  in 2014, President Putin and the Kremlin have been a full on propaganda effort basically [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=307.65999999999997s)]
*  against Ukraine. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=313.41999999999996s)]
*  And frankly, President Trump is starting to repeat some of the same things that the Russians [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=314.41999999999996s)]
*  have been saying too. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=318.14s)]
*  Fiona Hill, it's always great to talk to you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=319.14s)]
*  We hope to have you back again soon. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEjVDFdZbDg&t=321.09999999999997s)]
