# Rare look at Kim Jong Un's visit to North Korean nuclear facility
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY)
*  We are seeing new images out of North Korea of leader Kim Jong-un inspecting a banned uranium enrichment site. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=0.0s)]
*  State media says the Nuclear Weapons Institute is the country's production base for weapon-grade nuclear materials. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=9.0s)]
*  Kim vowed to increase North Korea's stockpile of nuclear weapons. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=15.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Ian Lee joins us now for more from our London bureau. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=19.0s)]
*  Ian, why are we seeing these pictures now? What do they tell us? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=24.0s)]
*  Well, its timing is interesting, Lindsay. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=29.0s)]
*  As we are less than two months from the presidential election, the release seems primarily to be an act of defiance against the United States. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=32.0s)]
*  Experts say that the pictures show the North's ability to greatly increase its nuclear weapons stockpile. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=39.0s)]
*  They also reveal that Pyongyang may have developed its own centrifuges to further its production of nuclear material. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=46.0s)]
*  Analysts believe that the number of centrifuges shown, which they estimate about a thousand, could produce enough uranium for a single bomb when fully operating year round. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=54.0s)]
*  Now, according to North Korean state media, Kim said nuclear weapons are needed for self-defense and the capability for a preemptive strike while adding the U.S. and its allies have crossed a red line. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=65.0s)]
*  So it definitely seems that they're trying to send a message with these pictures. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=76.0s)]
*  So Kim is adamant about producing as many nuclear weapons as possible. Why? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=82.0s)]
*  Well, there are a number of reasons experts believe North Korea is advancing its nuclear weapons program. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=87.0s)]
*  One is prestige. Kim wants to be seen and respected as a nuclear power. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=92.0s)]
*  That's something the United States, South Korea and Japan refuse to do. For him, the message is simple. There's no going back. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=97.0s)]
*  The other reason is security. Nuclear weapons serve as a deterrent against any aggression. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=103.0s)]
*  Kim will have looked at what happened to leaders of other countries like Libya and Iraq that gave up their nuclear weapons programs only to be overthrown by U.S.-led efforts years later. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=108.0s)]
*  This enrichment site is banned under multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions. So what are the next steps here? What can the U.N. do, if anything? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=118.0s)]
*  There really isn't much. North Korea is already under tight sanctions. And as we've seen, the longer a country is under sanctions, the more creative they become at skirting them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=126.0s)]
*  You also need countries willing to enforce them, which Beijing and Moscow seem reluctant to do. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=137.0s)]
*  Earlier this year, Russia blocked the extension of a U.N. panel that monitors sanctions against Pyongyang. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=142.0s)]
*  That doesn't remove sanctions, but it ends the group responsible for monitoring their implementation and violations. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=148.0s)]
*  And with that ending, experts say that will just make it easier for the North to avoid sanctions. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=154.0s)]
*  How will this all play into North Korea's relationship with Russia? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=161.0s)]
*  Yeah, Lindsay, the two countries have grown closer as the war in Ukraine progresses. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=165.0s)]
*  The North has been accused of supplying weapons to Moscow, including brand new ballistic missiles. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=170.0s)]
*  And as the Kremlin grows more isolated, expect that relationship only to strengthen. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=176.0s)]
*  Recently, Russia's top security official visited with Kim in North Korea, where the two men discussed bilateral and international issues. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=182.0s)]
*  Pyongyang's nuclear program doesn't seem to phase the Russians. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=190.0s)]
*  Both countries view the West as an adversary. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=193.0s)]
*  The North has what Russia wants, which is a huge supply of conventional weapons. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=196.0s)]
*  And Russia has what the North wants, which is money. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=201.0s)]
*  And, Lee, thank you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkHBKBJQJOY&t=205.0s)]
