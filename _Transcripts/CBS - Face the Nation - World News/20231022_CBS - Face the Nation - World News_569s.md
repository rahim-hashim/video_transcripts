# "We'll be prepared" if Iran escalates attacks, Secretary of State Antony Blinken says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY)
*  Now to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is at the State Department. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=3.88s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=4.88s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=5.88s)]
*  Tension is very high in the region. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=6.88s)]
*  Are you changing your security posture? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=9.16s)]
*  Are you pulling any U.S. personnel out of the area? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=11.32s)]
*  Margaret, we are concerned at the possibility of Iranian proxies escalating their attacks [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=14.4s)]
*  against our own personnel, our own people. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=21.6s)]
*  We're taking every measure to make sure that we can defend them and, if necessary, respond [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=25.08s)]
*  decisively. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=30.36s)]
*  Not at all what we're looking for, not at all what we want, but we'll be prepared if [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=31.68s)]
*  that's what they choose to do. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=35.62s)]
*  That sounds like quite possibly pulling people out. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=37.0s)]
*  In terms of the threat from Iran you just referenced there, President Biden in his Oval [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=41.94s)]
*  Office address said that the U.S. would hold Iran accountable. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  What does accountable mean? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=51.36s)]
*  What you've seen already, Margaret, is a very clear message from the president backed up [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  by the deployment of two of our largest aircraft carrier battle groups to make sure that it's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=57.72s)]
*  clear. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=63.24s)]
*  No one should take advantage of this moment to escalate, to further attacks on Israel [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  or, for that matter, attacks on us, on our personnel. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  And this is not by way of, in terms of what we're doing by provocation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=71.12s)]
*  It's designed to deter, designed to make clear that no one should use this moment in any [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=75.4s)]
*  way to escalate. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=79.72s)]
*  Well, stay tuned. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=81.52s)]
*  In terms of what's happening in Gaza, I know there are an estimated 500 to 600 Americans [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  Is there any chance Israel lets some of those Americans out or Egypt allows some of those [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  Americans in? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=94.08s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=95.08s)]
*  And to date, at least, Hamas has blocked them from leaving, showing once again its total [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=96.82s)]
*  disregard for civilians of any kind who are stuck in Gaza. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=102.08s)]
*  Have you asked the Israeli government to delay in order to give you more time to broker [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=107.08s)]
*  the release of these hostages? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=111.78s)]
*  First, step back for a second because it's important to remember what happened. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=113.88s)]
*  It's incredible how quickly that gets lost because it was only a couple of weeks ago [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=117.64s)]
*  that Hamas invaded Israel with its terrorist fighters and slaughtered, and I use that word [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=123.24s)]
*  very deliberately, slaughtered so many people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=132.76s)]
*  Again, men, women, young children, babies, old people, you name it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=135.32s)]
*  And they continue to rain rockets down on Israel. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  When I was there a few days ago, we had to take shelter a couple of times because they [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=143.6s)]
*  were coming rockets from Hamas. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=148.04s)]
*  So my point is this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=149.84s)]
*  No country, no country can be expected to tolerate this, to live with this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  And as we said from the start, Israel has both the right and even the obligation not [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=156.78s)]
*  only to defend itself but to try to make sure that to the best of its ability, this can't [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=162.1s)]
*  happen again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=166.22s)]
*  So we talk to the Israelis about what they're planning. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=167.22s)]
*  We give them our best advice. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=172.0s)]
*  It's important, as we've said, not only what they do but how they do it, particularly when [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=173.34s)]
*  it comes to making sure that civilians are as protected as they possibly can be in this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=177.22s)]
*  crossfire of Hamas' making. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=181.96s)]
*  But in terms of what we're talking to Israel about with regard to their military operations, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=183.66s)]
*  it really is focused on both how they do it and how best to achieve the results that they [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=187.9s)]
*  seek. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=193.26s)]
*  So let's talk about how they do it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=194.26s)]
*  You're right to lay out just how absolutely horrific that attack was two weeks ago. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=197.88s)]
*  Turning the page to what has happened during the following two weeks, UNICEF says 1,524 [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=204.3s)]
*  have been killed in the Gaza Strip during these bombings. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=213.54s)]
*  Why isn't the U.S. calling for at least a temporary ceasefire? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=217.78s)]
*  First, Margaret, when I hear the stories, when I see the pictures of young children [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=222.26s)]
*  who have lost their lives in this conflict of Hamas' making, whoever they are, wherever [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=232.33999999999997s)]
*  they are, whether they're Palestinians, whether they're Israelis, whether they're Jews or [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=237.14s)]
*  Muslims, it hits me and I know it hits virtually everyone right in the heart. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=241.86s)]
*  And that's why it's so important to do everything possible to protect them and why it's so important [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=250.5s)]
*  to do everything possible to get assistance to those who need it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  So why not ask for at least a temporary pause in the bombing as was proposed at the end [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=261.62s)]
*  of this week? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=267.06s)]
*  You've seen, first of all, that in order to get assistance in, we've had that happen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=268.34s)]
*  And you saw the first 20 trucks go in yesterday. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=275.78s)]
*  I expect more will follow today. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=278.14s)]
*  And the day after that, we want to make sure that we have sustained delivery of food, medicine, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=280.62s)]
*  water, the things that people need. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=284.65999999999997s)]
*  At the same time, I said something a minute ago that we have to remember. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=286.78s)]
*  Israel has to do everything it can to make sure this doesn't happen again. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=293.29999999999995s)]
*  Reasing things in place where they are now would allow Hamas to remain where it is and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=297.94s)]
*  to repeat what it's done sometime in the future. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=302.82s)]
*  No country could accept that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=305.85999999999996s)]
*  One of my colleagues who is on the ground in Israel and has traveled to the West Bank [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=308.73999999999995s)]
*  conducted an interview with Mr. Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian politician I'm sure you know. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=313.5s)]
*  He said he doesn't understand why President Biden, when he was in Israel, did not say [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=319.9s)]
*  enough is enough. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=324.97999999999996s)]
*  You wanted to respond and you responded. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=326.18s)]
*  You killed 4,000 Palestinians. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=328.5s)]
*  Stop. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=331.06s)]
*  Instead, you're encouraging a ground invasion. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=332.06s)]
*  How do you respond to enough is enough? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=335.82s)]
*  Enough is enough should have been the case with Hamas two weeks ago. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=341.86s)]
*  I think it would be good to hear the entire world speaking clearly and with one voice [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=351.26s)]
*  about the actions that Hamas took, about the slaughter of people, about the fact that that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=357.26s)]
*  should be absolutely intolerable, unacceptable to anyone, anywhere, any country, any people. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=362.53999999999996s)]
*  Second. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  In terms of U.S. interests in the region, one of America's closest allies, the King [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  Passion speech saying Palestinian lives seem to matter less than Israeli ones. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=377.98s)]
*  Our lives matter less than other lives. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=382.94s)]
*  The application of international laws, optional and human rights appear to have boundaries [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=385.02000000000004s)]
*  based on races and religions. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=389.14000000000004s)]
*  That's a warning from one of America's closest friends in the region that this is a dangerous [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=391.86s)]
*  message to be sending and it could have blowback. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=399.42s)]
*  Are you concerned? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=402.94s)]
*  Margaret, every life Palestinian, Israeli, Jewish, Muslim, Arab, every life has equal [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=404.66s)]
*  worth. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=414.66s)]
*  When I see the reports, when I see the photographs, when I hear the stories of young children, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  Palestinian children who've been killed or injured, it hits me right in the gut too, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=423.98s)]
*  just as it does when I hear, when I see these other stories, wherever it is. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=431.1s)]
*  We had here in our own country a little boy, six years old, Wadi in Chicago, who was viciously [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=435.62s)]
*  murdered apparently because he was a Palestinian American. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=445.62s)]
*  A little boy, six years old, didn't do anything to anyone. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=452.5s)]
*  I feel that strongly across the board no matter where it is. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=457.1s)]
*  But this is on Hamas and the fact is Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinian people. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=461.3s)]
*  It doesn't represent their just cause. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=467.98s)]
*  It doesn't represent their aspiration and legitimate aspiration for a state of their [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=470.58000000000004s)]
*  own. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=476.70000000000005s)]
*  On the contrary, it does everything to make life worse and more miserable. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=477.70000000000005s)]
*  Does the U.S. assess that it is actually possible for Israel to destroy both Hamas as an entity [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=484.18s)]
*  and its ideology? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=490.5s)]
*  Is it actually a military possibility? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=491.82s)]
*  The best way, the only way to defeat an ideology, no matter how warped, and in the case of Hamas, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=495.14s)]
*  it's about as warped as it possibly can be, is to make sure that there is a better, a [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=502.14s)]
*  clearer alternative for people. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=507.7s)]
*  And that alternative is very clear and it's very stark. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=510.22s)]
*  We have on the one hand countries throughout the region who want to come together to integrate, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=514.46s)]
*  to normalize relations and to lift up the rights of the Palestinian people, to be able [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  to have a future where they work together, go to school together, do business together, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=524.74s)]
*  travel to each other's countries. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=528.66s)]
*  That's one vision. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=530.3s)]
*  The other vision is the vision that Hamas has. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=531.74s)]
*  Death, destruction, nihilism, darkness. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=533.94s)]
*  Now, the responsibility that those of us who believe in the first vision have is to do [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=537.14s)]
*  everything possible to make it real so that people not only see it, but they can achieve [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=540.9799999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=546.06s)]
*  That's exactly what we were working on before this horrific attack on October 7th. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=547.06s)]
*  And that's the vision that we need to get back to. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=554.06s)]
*  But at the same time, we also have to deal with the fact that Hamas represents an active, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=556.6199999999999s)]
*  ongoing threat, and that has to be dealt with too. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=562.2199999999999s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time this morning. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=565.54s)]
*  Thanks Margaret. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n6y2biVmlY&t=567.9399999999999s)]
