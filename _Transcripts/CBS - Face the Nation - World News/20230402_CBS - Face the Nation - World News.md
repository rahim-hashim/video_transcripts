# Wall Street Journal editor says it's "hugely reassuring" Blinken spoke to Russia's top diplomat
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4)
*  Joining us now to discuss Russia's detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Groskovich [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=0.0s)]
*  is the Journal's editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker, and she joins us from New York. Good morning to you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=5.44s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret, and thanks very much for having me on. And also I just want to say before [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=12.64s)]
*  we get going, thank you to CBS and all the other news networks and news outlets that are continuing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=17.68s)]
*  to focus on this story. It's really important for us to keep focused on Evan's plight. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=23.28s)]
*  At a time when I know the news is very busy. Well, we agree with you, and I want to ask you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  this morning, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=36.08s)]
*  It is very rare that they speak, but according to the State Department, the Secretary had grave [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=41.84s)]
*  concern over the unacceptable detention of a journalist, and that is Evan. What do you [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=48.64s)]
*  know about this? Has any of it helped Evan's case? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=55.44s)]
*  Well, one of the big problems in this case is we know so little. We know very, to the best of our [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=62.0s)]
*  knowledge, we know that Evan is being held in a prison in Moscow, but we haven't been able to get [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=68.88s)]
*  any messages to him. We haven't heard anything from him. There's been very little official [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=74.08s)]
*  information. The fact that Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to his counterpart today [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=79.52s)]
*  is hugely reassuring to us. We know that the U.S. government's taking the case very seriously, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=85.6s)]
*  right up to the top, and as I say, that for us has been gratifying to know that they take it [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=91.6s)]
*  as seriously as they do. There is a legal determination being wrongfully detained, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=96.88s)]
*  and it comes with it a little bit more leeway for the fight that the U.S. government can put up here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=102.96s)]
*  What difference do you think that will make in this case, and how quickly will it come? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=109.6s)]
*  Well, we're hoping that the government will move swiftly to designate Evan as wrongfully detained. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=116.08s)]
*  It can take a long time, but we're hoping, we're optimistic it'll move a bit more swiftly in this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=125.44s)]
*  case. When that happens, it's an official recognition that the charges against Evan are [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=131.04s)]
*  entirely bogus, and once that official recognition comes, things can then move a bit more rapidly. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=137.6s)]
*  Well, we know that when Evan was taken, there was also a very swift hearing. His lawyer was [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=145.28s)]
*  not allowed in. The State Department said that U.S. officials were not given any access to him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  Do you have any timeline? It sounds like you don't have much more clarity, but will he be given what [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=158.32s)]
*  are supposed to be the legal standards here of access? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=163.68s)]
*  Well, I think that's anyone's guess. We are hopeful that a lawyer will get to see him next week. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=168.72s)]
*  We're pressing constantly for reassurance that he's not being mistreated in any way, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=176.24s)]
*  but we're dealing with the Russian authorities here. It's difficult to know what will happen next. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=183.28s)]
*  I'm optimistic that we'll be able to make some sort of contact with him next week, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=188.96s)]
*  but who knows? From the very top of the Russian government, we have seen this commented on [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=193.36s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's own spokesperson claims Evan was caught red-handed. According to our CBS [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=199.52s)]
*  contributor John Sullivan, who was former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, he said, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=206.8s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal is too high-profile an organization for this to have been a mistake, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  for this not to have been targeted, and it had to have been approved at the very highest levels [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=216.32000000000002s)]
*  in Moscow. Do you have any idea what the motivation was? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=221.12s)]
*  I have no idea. Evan is a very talented, experienced reporter. He's accredited to report [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=227.84s)]
*  from Russia, and he was on an assignment doing what he always does. He was gathering information. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=236.32s)]
*  He was reporting from the ground to provide our readers with eyewitness accounts of what it's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  like to be in Russia at the moment. It's a complete outrage that he was arrested like this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=246.88s)]
*  I really don't understand. What the Russian authorities are saying is utter nonsense. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=254.32s)]
*  There was some Russian reporting he was working on a story about the military and others, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=261.68s)]
*  potentially about a mercenary group known as the Wagner Group. Was that true? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=266.32s)]
*  Evan was doing what he always does. He was out reporting. He's a very experienced reporter. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=271.04s)]
*  He's covered all sorts of stories. He was on a mission over in the East, writing about—he [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=280.24s)]
*  was just doing what he always does. He was newsgathering and talking to his contacts out there. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=287.44s)]
*  I know that I've read you've pulled your Moscow bureau chief from her post. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=293.36s)]
*  How important is it to be able to continue to report from Russia, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=298.0s)]
*  and do you plan to be able to continue this in some way? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, look, reporting out of Russia has become increasingly difficult, not just for foreign [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  reporters, but especially for Russian reporters. The Wall Street Journal is committed to covering [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=313.52s)]
*  stories from Russia, from stories from around the world, but we're also, obviously, we put out the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=321.76s)]
*  safety of our journalists first. A lot of other news organizations no longer have a presence in [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=327.92s)]
*  Russia. It's clearly, and particularly with this what's happened to Evan, Russia is sending a very, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=333.36s)]
*  a bad signal that it's not a safe place for journalists, even journalists who are accredited [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=339.68s)]
*  to work there, to work from. So, we are committed to covering stories from Russia, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=345.2s)]
*  we are committed to covering the news, we are also committed to the safety of our journalists. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=351.36s)]
*  So important. Emma Tucker, thank you for your time. We wish you well. We'll be right back. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXohZ3glSv4&t=357.2s)]
