# Any economic impact from Middle East unrest is "not desirable," IMF's Kristalina Georgieva says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8)
*  We're back with the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=0.0s)]
*  Kristalina Gyorgeva. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=3.24s)]
*  I got it right this time. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=5.92s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=7.0s)]
*  You did indeed. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  OK. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=8.2s)]
*  Oil markets have been swinging because of this instability in the Middle East, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=9.6s)]
*  escalation risk, the threat to global shipping as well. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=15.08s)]
*  Can you gauge at this point what the economic impact will be? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=18.84s)]
*  So far, it has been somewhat moderate. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=23.64s)]
*  We have seen on Friday when the news of potential strike from Iran into Israel came, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=27.2s)]
*  oil prices jumped by 1%. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=35.88s)]
*  We have seen so far the impact of this conflict primarily in the epicenter affecting Israel [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=39.08s)]
*  and in particular devastating Gaza and West Bank with spillovers to the neighboring countries. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=48.36s)]
*  Even the shipping destruction in the Red Sea has not yet led to a major impact. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=57.76s)]
*  But any impact, as small as it might be, is not desirable in an economy with high uncertainty [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=65.56s)]
*  and inflation still not being brought down to target. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=76.36s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  Oil prices go up, inflation goes up. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=80.84s)]
*  So what can be done to bring down uncertainty is, of course, for others, for those in politics, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  the military, from an economic standpoint, the more we reduce uncertainty, the better. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  We have a lot of uncertainty right now, one of them being the US Congress and funding [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  for these conflicts. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  Congress is looking at authorizing the Biden administration to seize Russian state assets, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=110.28s)]
*  potentially for use in a negotiation or to rebuild Ukraine. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=116.88s)]
*  What do you think of that idea? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=121.04s)]
*  This is really for the jurisdictions that have authority to take a decision to make. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=122.92s)]
*  But it could have global impact. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=128.48s)]
*  What we do is we look at it and then we assess what the impact might be. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=129.88s)]
*  And then, of course, it is a matter of how would that be received as news across the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=135.24s)]
*  world, countries that are holding their reserves. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=143.12s)]
*  And let's remember today there are $11 trillion in reserves in countries around the world. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=147.16s)]
*  They would be looking at that with some attention. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  So what our position is, when a decision is being taken, whatever the decision is, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=159.72s)]
*  please think of the consequences and especially the law of unintended consequences and factor [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=167.6s)]
*  it in. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=173.88s)]
*  What you're saying there is that this could essentially cause what? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=175.2s)]
*  A flight of assets out of the banking systems in Europe in particular? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=179.36s)]
*  We have not seen the reaction to be of that magnitude. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=183.68s)]
*  Your point is very simple. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=188.84s)]
*  We have an integrated global economy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=191.56s)]
*  Even with the winds of fragmentation, still, countries are connected with each other. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=194.08s)]
*  So whatever decision is being taken, take it with an eye of the desired impact and also [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=199.08s)]
*  of what might be an intended consequence. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=207.04s)]
*  We're in an election year, as you know. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=210.68s)]
*  Goldman Sachs put out a report outlining potential tariff increases as the most important [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=213.4s)]
*  issue for the economic outlook if President Trump were to be re-elected. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=219.36s)]
*  He continues to float ideas of tariffs anywhere from 10 to 60 percent or upwards. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=224.96s)]
*  How would you gauge the impact and the risk of doing that? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  Let me first reflect on why we have seen over the last decade a backlash on globalization. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=234.6s)]
*  We all know an integrated world economy lifts up growth prospects and leads to improvements [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=242.16s)]
*  in standard of living, but not for everyone. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  What we have seen is that communities that have been negatively impacted by globalization [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  and have not been attended, they have not been helped to cope with it, are the backbone [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=262.0s)]
*  of this backlash that we are seeing today. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=268.48s)]
*  So my most important point is trade is good, but it is not necessarily good for everyone. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=271.48s)]
*  And policies have to reflect on that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=281.8s)]
*  We have to make sure that the benefits are more broadly shared in society. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=284.98s)]
*  Tariffs would add to inflation as well. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  You agree as an economist? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  Of course. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  Let me just be very clear. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=297.28s)]
*  The reason we are proponents of an integrated world economy is because it brings costs down [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=299.58s)]
*  and it increases the well-being of people around the world. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=308.58s)]
*  So we are on the view that we should be striving to have a more integrated economy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=312.7s)]
*  Let me say this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=321.41999999999996s)]
*  What we are seeing is already trade patterns are shifting. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=322.41999999999996s)]
*  What is the impact? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=329.17999999999995s)]
*  The impact is the so-called connector countries play a bigger role. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=330.26s)]
*  So you don't see a trade from A to B, you see trade going A to B to C to D. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=335.7s)]
*  So we are lengthening the supply chains and that of course leads to a higher cost on consumers. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=343.73999999999995s)]
*  And as you said, not great for inflation. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=349.66s)]
*  Well, you have a lot of work ahead of you in the second term. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=352.46000000000004s)]
*  You were just re-elected too. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=356.98s)]
*  Congratulations on that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=358.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=359.82000000000005s)]
*  Thank you, Margaret. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=360.82000000000005s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vbPNkgrJ8&t=361.82000000000005s)]
