# Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says China trip "has been successful" in forging relationship
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw)
*  Janet Yellen is the second cabinet secretary to make a goodwill mission to Beijing in the last few weeks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=0.0s)]
*  We spoke with her exclusively before she departed China. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=6.32s)]
*  At the top of your meeting with the Chinese vice premier, he actually acknowledged [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=10.24s)]
*  one of those awkward moments. He mentioned the Chinese spy balloon. He called it an airship. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=14.32s)]
*  Can you say at this point that tension has been smoothed over? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=20.0s)]
*  Well, what I can tell you is that I had a very constructive visit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=24.72s)]
*  I received a warm welcome and had very substantive series of meetings. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=31.44s)]
*  We had substantive conversations about the global economy, developments in our own economies, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=38.64s)]
*  financial markets, and a list of concerns that each of us brought to the table that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=46.96s)]
*  we agreed to follow up on over time. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=54.32s)]
*  Understood. The U.S. ambassador to China, Nick Burns, told me just last month that four or five [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  different American companies had been experiencing intimidation at the hand of Chinese authorities, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  and he pointed towards an espionage law that had recently been rolled out. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=69.2s)]
*  Did you get assurances that American firms won't be intimidated? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=73.44s)]
*  Well, that certainly is one of the concerns that I expressed. I had the chance to meet with American [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=79.36s)]
*  businesses and to hear about their concerns, but and certainly in my meetings that is a concern [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=87.04s)]
*  that I raised. It's something that we will have further conversations about and try to address [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=95.76s)]
*  over time. The administration has taken some targeted national security focused [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=101.84s)]
*  measures that do impact trade and the economy, including some restrictions on high end technology [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=107.92s)]
*  sales. The administration is reportedly also considering restrictions on computer chips [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=114.72s)]
*  related to artificial technology and cloud computing. Do you have a sense of what the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  retaliation will be from China when the U.S. does this? Well, an objective of my trip was to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=125.68s)]
*  explain that national security is something that we can't compromise about and we will protect, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=135.04s)]
*  and we will do so even if it harms our own narrow economic interests, but that when we take such [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=145.12s)]
*  actions, which do have an effect on the Chinese economy, that we will make sure that they are [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=154.0s)]
*  transparent, narrowly targeted, and well explained. And this is a point that I tried to make [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=164.48s)]
*  in my conversations with Chinese counterparts. I would point out that the Chinese also protect [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  their own national security through export controls and other similar devices, including [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=181.11999999999998s)]
*  controls on outbound investment. I explained that President Biden is examining potential [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=188.16s)]
*  controls on outbound investment in certain very narrow high technology areas and that if we go [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  forward with these, that they will be indeed very narrowly targeted and should not be something that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=208.32s)]
*  will have a significant impact on the investment climate between our two countries. You're talking [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  there, I think, about the long delayed executive order that would put some restrictions on what [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=226.0s)]
*  American companies can do when it comes to investing in China. Is that still in question? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=231.12s)]
*  Did you hear anything in your meetings that would make you tweak it, change it, pull back from it? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=236.88s)]
*  Well, mainly I tried to explain what it is that we're contemplating. It's still something being [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=243.84s)]
*  discussed in the administration and the timing of it is not yet certain. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=251.28s)]
*  Does that mean there's a chance that the Biden administration will drop it, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=258.48s)]
*  that they won't issue this executive order? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=261.36s)]
*  Well, no final decision has been made, but as I've said previously, this is something [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=264.16s)]
*  we're looking at very carefully. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=270.8s)]
*  You did mention there an action China just took in regard to export controls, meaning they [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=272.64s)]
*  have this stranglehold on a lot of critical minerals and they just blocked the export of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=278.96s)]
*  two of them that are really essential for computer chips. How should people understand this? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=284.08s)]
*  Is this a warning shot? Is this Beijing saying, look at what we can do and if you take further [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=290.32s)]
*  restrictions, we'll ramp it up from here? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=296.48s)]
*  I certainly express concern about this action and contrast it with the actions that we've taken. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=299.6s)]
*  Our own actions are narrowly targeted to address national security concerns and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=309.68s)]
*  it's not clear that the actions that the Chinese took are similarly narrowly targeted at their [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=318.4s)]
*  national security concerns. So this is an area that I expressed concern about. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=326.8s)]
*  Are you suggesting there that it was just a retaliatory action? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, potentially. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=338.72s)]
*  Are you concerned that this is the beginning of an escalation? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=341.68s)]
*  Well, my purpose is to make sure that we don't engage in a series of unintended escalatory [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=344.8s)]
*  actions that will be harmful to our overall economic relationship with one another. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=353.44s)]
*  We have had very little contact, both senior officials and also just the American people [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=362.48s)]
*  and the Chinese people, who've had very little contact with one another over the last several [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=371.04s)]
*  years, in part because of COVID. And that's a situation where misunderstandings can develop. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=376.88s)]
*  We have a new team on the economic side in Beijing that it's important to establish [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  person-to-person relationships and to open ongoing channels of communication where [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=392.48s)]
*  concerns can be aired and discussed. And I do think my trip has been successful in forging those [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=399.92s)]
*  relationships and creating the opportunity for a deeper set of more frequent contacts [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=408.24s)]
*  at our staff levels. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=416.88s)]
*  I was just in China. I know how much concern there is there about the slowing of the economy. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=418.88s)]
*  Are you concerned that the slowdown in China will have a negative impact and drag U.S. growth? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, that is a topic that I discussed with my Chinese counterparts. We talked about [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=434.23999999999995s)]
*  the policy actions that they think see as appropriate to stimulate their economy and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=440.4s)]
*  promote what they describe as high-quality growth. And I was able to better understand [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=449.6s)]
*  the actions that they do think are appropriate. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=458.16s)]
*  How significant are the problems in the Chinese economy? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, I think that they've opened up their economy following its closure from COVID [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=466.56s)]
*  and are working through a series of issues relating to issues in the property sector, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=475.6s)]
*  in real estate, and consumer spending there has rebounded a little bit less. Consumers are showing [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=483.68s)]
*  more caution and saving more than many commentators expected, many economic forecasters [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=492.8s)]
*  expected. But my counterparts talked about their perspective on this and the actions that they're [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=501.04s)]
*  taking. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=508.72s)]
*  Before I let you go, I do want to ask you about the economy here at home. What signal should [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=509.92s)]
*  Americans at home be looking for to understand that economic growth will be back at a point [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=515.44s)]
*  like it was before the pandemic? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  It's my hope that and belief that there is a path to bring inflation down in the context of a healthy [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=524.48s)]
*  labor market. And the data that I've seen suggests we're on that path. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=531.76s)]
*  The jobs number did suggest a little bit of a slowdown there. Is the risk of recession [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=536.9599999999999s)]
*  completely off the table from your point of view? I mean, where do you put the odds? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=542.48s)]
*  It's not completely off the table, but we would expect with the job market as strong as it is now [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=547.2s)]
*  to see a slower pace of ongoing job gains. Prime-age labor force participation is at the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=556.0s)]
*  highest level in several decades, so we've seen this strong job market attract workers back to it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=565.44s)]
*  But if that stabilizes at a high level, we should expect the monthly job gains to be [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=574.4s)]
*  coming down toward a more normal level. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=583.36s)]
*  And you can see our full conversation with Secretary Yellen on our website or our YouTube [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=586.96s)]
*  channel. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8llJOdyZdVw&t=590.8s)]
