# Chinese coast guard seen clashing with Philippine Navy boats in South China Sea
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y)
*  Video released by the Philippine military reveals a chaotic scene in the South China [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Sea. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=6.88s)]
*  The Chinese Coast Guard is seen ramming and boarding inflatable Philippine Navy boats [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=7.88s)]
*  with backs, bats rather, axes and swords. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=13.16s)]
*  The Philippine Navy was conducting a resupply mission for Filipino troops stationed in a [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=16.94s)]
*  disputed territory in the sea. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  And the escalation is just the latest in a series of dangerous encounters in the area [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=23.56s)]
*  involving China. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=27.26s)]
*  This prompting questions as to whether United States will be called to intervene. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=28.78s)]
*  Let's bring in Demetri Sevastopulo for more on this. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=33.02s)]
*  He's a U.S. China correspondent at the Financial Times. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=35.7s)]
*  Demetri, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=38.3s)]
*  Can you give us some additional context? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=39.7s)]
*  Why did this happen? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=41.260000000000005s)]
*  Well the on the on this reef, the Philippines have put a ship called the Sierra Madre that's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=43.74s)]
*  been deliberately grounded there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=50.02s)]
*  1999 as a attempt to reinforce Philippine claims to this part of the South China Sea. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=52.7s)]
*  Much of the South China Sea is contested by China and its maritime neighbors. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  The Philippines have been sending in resupplies to Marines who were stationed on the ship, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=65.10000000000001s)]
*  but the Chinese have been trying to block those resupply missions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=70.5s)]
*  The Chinese say the Philippines are trying to strengthen the ship because it's at risk [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=73.10000000000001s)]
*  of disintegrating. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=76.78s)]
*  It's very rusty. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=77.78s)]
*  It's dilapidated. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=78.78s)]
*  Now we had a story the other day saying that actually the Philippines have secretly been [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=80.86s)]
*  bringing construction materials to the ship to try and reinforce it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=84.18s)]
*  But actually it's irrelevant because an international court has ruled that China has no rights over [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=88.22s)]
*  the second Thomas Shoal or the Sierra Madre which is sitting on top of that shell. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=92.5s)]
*  But it has become arguably the most dangerous flashpoint in the Indo-Pacific region. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=96.62s)]
*  So the Philippines says it has not considered invoking its mutual defense treaty with the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=100.82s)]
*  United States. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  What does that treaty entail and how could it have changed the dynamic of the situation? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=105.74000000000001s)]
*  Well, either the Philippines or the US can actually invoke the treaty. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=111.26s)]
*  It's a 1951 mutual defense treaty. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=114.66s)]
*  If it's invoked, essentially what it says is the two sides have to come together to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=117.42s)]
*  meet a common danger. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=121.34s)]
*  And the question then is what would the US do to help the Philippines? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=122.54s)]
*  You know, the US could, for example, send in Navy ships to accompany the Philippine [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=126.54s)]
*  boats that are supplying the Marines on the Sierra Madre. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=131.5s)]
*  That would bring American ships in very close proximity to the Chinese Coast Guard, which [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=136.38s)]
*  is leading a lot of the aggressive activity that you're showing on the screen and would [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=140.7s)]
*  cause a certain amount of tension with China. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=145.17999999999998s)]
*  A more dramatic or bold move would be for the US to conduct the resupply missions itself, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=147.89999999999998s)]
*  which would be even more dramatic because China views this as a bilateral dispute between [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  Beijing and Manila. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=158.62s)]
*  But either way, if the treaty is invoked, it really raises the stakes in this part of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=161.01999999999998s)]
*  the South China Sea. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=165.82s)]
*  So I have less than a minute with you, but that said, could you see, pretend a foreseeable [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=166.9s)]
*  future in which things do escalate in this region? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=171.78s)]
*  Well, I think things are getting closer and closer to the treaty potentially being invoked. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=174.34s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that happened earlier this week in that clash was a Filipino sailor [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=180.34s)]
*  had their thumb cut off in part of those clashes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=184.82s)]
*  If a Filipino sailor died, it would be a huge deal. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=189.94s)]
*  I asked President Marcos in Singapore a few weeks ago, the Philippine president, would [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=193.5s)]
*  it cross a red line if a Filipino national was killed in one of these incidents? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=197.62s)]
*  And he said it would almost certainly cross a red line and would be very close to an act [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=201.78s)]
*  of war. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=205.62s)]
*  So right now, the crisis in Asia is not Taiwan. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=206.62s)]
*  The biggest crisis is the South China Sea, and frankly, it's not getting enough attention. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=209.66s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=213.38s)]
*  Okay, Dimitri Sevastopoulou, we'll have to have you back. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=214.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iaNoBnt99Y&t=217.42000000000002s)]
