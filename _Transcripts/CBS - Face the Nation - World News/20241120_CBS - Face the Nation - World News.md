# Biden administration will give Ukraine controversial mines
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y)
*  U.S. officials tell CBS News the Biden administration will provide anti-personnel mines to Ukraine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  to help slow Russia's ground forces. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=6.3s)]
*  Humanitarian groups have criticized the use of these mines because they can pose a threat [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  to civilians years after a conflict is over. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=13.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Kiev temporarily shut down Wednesday over fears of a possible [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=16.12s)]
*  air attack. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=20.8s)]
*  CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports from the Ukrainian capital [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=21.8s)]
*  city. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=25.84s)]
*  Today here in Kiev, the air raid alarm sounded and sent us scrambling for cover in our hotel [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=27.0s)]
*  basement. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=32.48s)]
*  We took the alert very seriously because earlier in the day, the U.S. Embassy in Kiev announced [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  it was temporarily closing because of a quote, potential significant air attack. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=38.96s)]
*  A Ukrainian military official told us they had information that Russia could try to strike [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=44.56s)]
*  the centre of Kiev with ballistic missiles. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=49.44s)]
*  In the end, no missiles landed that we're aware of, but that warning today came after [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=52.76s)]
*  Ukraine fired eight American-made Atacams into Russia, according to U.S. officials. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=57.44s)]
*  Atacams are missiles with a maximum range of close to 200 miles. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=63.96s)]
*  And their target was a military facility in the Bryansk region of southern Russia, according [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=67.8s)]
*  to the Russian Defence Ministry. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=72.88s)]
*  Now, President Biden gave permission to Ukraine to use Atacams deep inside Russian territory [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=74.68s)]
*  three days ago. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=79.88s)]
*  Before that, their use was more limited because of concerns the powerful weapons could further [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=81.64s)]
*  escalate this conflict. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=86.44s)]
*  The Kremlin, though, seems to be stoking fears of an escalation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=88.4s)]
*  Vladimir Putin approved a change in Russia's nuclear doctrine yesterday, lowering the threshold [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=92.16s)]
*  for a nuclear strike. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=97.84s)]
*  A U.S. official called that, quote, irresponsible rhetoric. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=99.32s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=103.88s)]
*  Holly Williams, thank you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=104.88s)]
*  Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, William Taylor, joins us now. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=106.8s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you for being here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=110.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Lindsay. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=112.2s)]
*  We have spoken to you before about how the U.S. long-range missiles could impact the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=113.56s)]
*  war. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=118.28s)]
*  How about these anti-personnel mines? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=119.28s)]
*  How will Ukraine use them, and to what effect? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=121.16s)]
*  So these are designed, of course, to slow down infantry attacks. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=124.84s)]
*  The Russians have learned, let's be clear, the Russians have learned some things about [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=130.0s)]
*  how to win on the battlefield. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=134.76s)]
*  They're not winning, but they're changing tactics so that they can take some ground. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=136.8s)]
*  They realize that they can't win by using armor, by using tanks and armored personnel [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=141.6s)]
*  carriers, because the Ukrainians are able to take them out, because they can see them [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=147.88s)]
*  with their drones and attack them with their drones. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=153.0s)]
*  So they've changed their tactics. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=155.2s)]
*  Russians have changed their tactics and now are just sending infantry waves after infantry [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=157.2s)]
*  waves. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  Mass forms of numbers of Russian soldiers that are sent in to the maw of the prepared [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=163.0s)]
*  Ukrainian positions, and it doesn't matter to the Russians how many they lose, they just [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=172.32s)]
*  keep pushing and keep pushing with another wave. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=177.84s)]
*  And so the Ukrainians, while killing an incredible number of Russians, Russian soldiers, are [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=181.0s)]
*  having to fall back. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=187.16s)]
*  So these mines will slow that down. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=189.4s)]
*  These mines will slow this mass attacks by Russian soldiers on the ground. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=193.4s)]
*  Ambassador, it's my understanding that these mines will be used on Ukrainian sovereign [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  land. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=203.84s)]
*  Are there concerns here, because we mentioned humanitarian groups criticizing the use of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=204.84s)]
*  these mines because of potential harmful threats to civilians down the road? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=209.52s)]
*  Do you share those concerns? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=214.28s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=216.08s)]
*  The Ukrainians share these concerns, and the U.S. government, I'm sure, shares these concerns. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=217.56s)]
*  And they're taking steps to try to ameliorate risks. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  As you say, it's on Ukrainian territory. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=227.48s)]
*  They hope to take this territory back. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  They hope that the Ukrainians will have control over this territory, and they know where these [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=231.44s)]
*  mines will be, and they can take them out. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=236.48s)]
*  And I understand these are also mines that can be deactivated either over time or by [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  remote control. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=244.92s)]
*  And there's commitment by the Ukrainians to remove them after the conflict. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  So there are concerns that are valid, certainly valid concerns, and I think they're being [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=251.96s)]
*  addressed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=257.4s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned North Korea could send up to 100,000 [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=258.4s)]
*  troops to help Russia. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=263.0s)]
*  How could that change the trajectory of the war, and are there a lot of challenges for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=264.24s)]
*  the Russian military in utilizing those troops, such as something as basic as a language barrier? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=267.64s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=273.04s)]
*  To integrate forces, to integrate North Korean forces with Russian forces is difficult. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=274.76s)]
*  It's difficult to do that in any case. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=280.0s)]
*  This is what NATO does, Lindsey. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=282.12s)]
*  NATO practices year after year after year after year, decade after decade, exactly this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=283.84s)]
*  How do forces talk to, how do forces from different countries talk to each other, work [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=289.8s)]
*  together, combine tactics to be able to have some real effect on the battlefield? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=293.88s)]
*  So that's a challenge. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=299.28s)]
*  That's no doubt a challenge for the Russians and the North Koreans. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=300.28s)]
*  100,000 is a big number. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=302.92s)]
*  I don't think that's been confirmed yet, but that's one of the reasons, Lindsey, that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  these long-range weapons, the Tacoms and the German version, the German version if they're [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=309.8s)]
*  approved, but also the British and French version of these long-range missiles can be [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=314.6s)]
*  effective at trying to slow down and deter these North Koreans that are coming in in [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=319.12s)]
*  these large numbers. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=324.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=325.88s)]
*  Ambassador William Taylor will have to leave it there for now. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=326.88s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=329.04s)]
*  Thank you, Lindsey. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6Typgmc_Y&t=330.04s)]
