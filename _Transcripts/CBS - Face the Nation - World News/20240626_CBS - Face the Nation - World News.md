# Coup attempt in Bolivia fails as president urges people to mobilize
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU)
*  Armored vehicles and soldiers have withdrawn from outside Bolivia's presidential palace [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=0.0s)]
*  following what appears to be a failed coup attempt Wednesday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=9.52s)]
*  Earlier vehicles could be seen slamming into the presidential palace's gates. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=13.72s)]
*  The country's general commander of the army appeared to lead the attempted coup in an [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  attempt to quote restore democracy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=21.48s)]
*  There have been serious tensions in Bolivia's ruling socialist party ahead of elections [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  in 2025 involving the current president and his former ally. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=28.4s)]
*  The president called on people to organize against this recent uprising and urged those [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=32.36s)]
*  rebelling to stand down. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=36.46s)]
*  Eduardo Gamara joins us now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=38.68s)]
*  He's a professor of politics and international relations at Florida International University. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  He also directed the university's Latin American and Caribbean center. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=49.76s)]
*  Let me ask this to start. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=51.4s)]
*  How many warning signs were there about a potential coup? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=53.56s)]
*  There were many in fact. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  Bolivia has been undergoing a very severe crisis, a very severe political crisis largely [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=61.2s)]
*  between the current president and the former president, Evo Morales, all with respect to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=67.0s)]
*  the elections next year. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  Both are men who are interested in getting reelected, Evo coming back after five years [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  out of power. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=81.04s)]
*  So that's the underlying tension. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=82.72s)]
*  And much of what's going on with the military, the main thing right now that people are saying [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=85.6s)]
*  is that this was a self-coup, that this is a coup that was largely orchestrated by the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=91.6s)]
*  sitting president as a way to regain strength and to position himself well for next year's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=97.28s)]
*  election. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=106.4s)]
*  So the warning signs have been there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=107.53999999999999s)]
*  And one more interesting thing over the last week is that the U.S. embassy was, we don't [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=110.36s)]
*  have an ambassador there, but the charge of the affairs, somebody dubbed her voice on [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=117.0s)]
*  AI and she was accused of plotting a coup. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  And so she was called into the foreign minister's office. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  And of course the U.S. reiterated its support for democracy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=131.28s)]
*  But I'm sure that now in the aftermath of this, there will be claims that there were [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  foreign powers behind the coup and that the opposition was behind the coup. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  But largely it's a little bit of political theater more than anything else. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=148.0s)]
*  At this point, Professor, do you think the election goes off fair and square? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=152.28s)]
*  Well there's, you know, the elections are scheduled for a year and a half from now. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=158.68s)]
*  And everything is so tense. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=164.76s)]
*  The political situation is tense, but the economy is in shambles. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=167.48s)]
*  And so this serves sort of as the perfect excuse to say that the conditions are not [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=172.76s)]
*  there for elections to be held next year. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=178.64s)]
*  So let's see how this plays out. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=181.68s)]
*  I hope that the president emerges from this better for the wear and that he doesn't pursue [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=183.92s)]
*  more authoritarian ambitions because he's locked up a lot of people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=194.8s)]
*  Bolivia has political prisoners and a lot of them are locked up by this president. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=198.68s)]
*  So it's always nice to see two people fighting for power and control when a country is falling [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=203.72s)]
*  apart. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=209.32s)]
*  Does it does it seem like they they care what's happening on the streets? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=210.32s)]
*  Well they both both of these, Evo Morales has been mobilizing people. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=216.56s)]
*  In fact, he was calling for street demonstrations and blockades and the like to prevent some [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=222.36s)]
*  of the things that the president is doing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=230.36s)]
*  And the president, of course, was trying to find a way to control his erstwhile boss. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=233.56s)]
*  And many are saying that this is what he found, that this was the best mechanism that he found. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=242.4s)]
*  I mean, not a bullet was fired. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  Nobody was hurt as of right now. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=250.12s)]
*  But what will come after is, I think, going to be very interesting to observe. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=253.88s)]
*  Cedar, that word you used sounds like a pretty good word maybe to describe this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  Eduardo Gamara, thank you so much for your time. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=263.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=266.0s)]
*  Bye. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=267.0s)]
*  Bye bye. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoLy-9BTqbU&t=268.0s)]
