# Looking ahead on Ukraine, the Middle East and the U.S. southern border
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ)
*  As we near the end of 2024, many of the global conflicts that dominated the headlines will be top of mind for world leaders in the new year, especially President-elect Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump has called for a swift end to the war in Ukraine, which has only gotten more intense in recent weeks. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=9.0s)]
*  He is also calling for the safe return of all remaining hostages in Gaza, which might only happen if Israel and Hamas can finally reach a ceasefire deal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=15.0s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Beno ground joins us now for a look at some of the biggest national security stories of the year. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=24.0s)]
*  And let's start with the war in Ukraine. How is that fighting intensified this year and what might develop in 2025? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=31.0s)]
*  Right. Good to see you. Some of the biggest recent developments include the introduction of foreign soldiers by Russia onto the battlefield. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=39.0s)]
*  North Korean soldiers arrived in on the front lines of Ukraine several weeks ago, and ultimately their presence is what ultimately led President Biden to authorize Ukraine to use U.S.-made long-range weapons inside of Russia. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=49.0s)]
*  Since that time, we know that North Korea has suffered fatalities on the battlefield in Ukraine, and the war continues, unfortunately, to violently continue. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=66.0s)]
*  We know that President-elect Trump has said that he wants to end the war in Ukraine quickly. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=76.0s)]
*  We also know that he considers Biden's decisions to authorize the use of those long-range U.S. weapons inside of Russia to be a category mistake. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=81.0s)]
*  So we will all be looking to see whether he does restrict Ukraine from using U.S.-made long-range weapons inside of Russia and whether he agrees with Putin that in order to end the war, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=90.0s)]
*  Putin should keep some of the territory that Russia has managed to hold over the last few years. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=102.0s)]
*  Let's turn now to the Middle East. The war between Israel and Hamas has been raging on for more than a year now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=107.0s)]
*  Where does that situation stand today, and is there hope for a ceasefire in the new year, especially with President-elect Trump expected to weigh in? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=113.0s)]
*  Well, despite securing a ceasefire in Lebanon, the Biden administration has been unsuccessful when it comes to establishing a permanent ceasefire between Hamas and the Israeli government. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=122.0s)]
*  So we know that areas of Gaza continue to be bombarded, and the terrorist organization Hamas continues to hold many, many hostages, despite the fact that October 7, 2023 is long in the rearview mirror. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=132.0s)]
*  President-elect Trump has said that he wants to end that war quickly. He has said that he considers ending the war between Israel and Hamas to be easier than ending the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=146.0s)]
*  We'll see if that proves to be true, and that he is very focused on getting those hostages back. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=155.0s)]
*  Now, we do know that one of Hamas's biggest supporters, Iran, has been seriously weakened over the past several months due to bombardment of its proxies by Israel, the United States, and others, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=160.0s)]
*  as well as a series of losses in places like Syria and Lebanon. So we'll see if President-elect Trump has a strategy to bolster negotiations between Hamas and Israel, but also importantly, whether he takes a different approach when it comes to Iran. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=173.0s)]
*  Remember, President-elect Trump, during his first term, launched an unprecedented U.S. military strike inside of Iran's borders itself and assassinated IRGC commander Qasem Soleimani. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=188.0s)]
*  Finally, we have to ask you about immigration, a top issue in the presidential election. What has happened to the pace of migrant encounters at the border, and how could immigration policy see some of those sweeping changes under the next administration now? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=199.0s)]
*  Well, Rick, here's where it gets interesting, because President-elect Trump campaigned on a policy of doing everything differently than President Biden when it comes to immigration. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=213.0s)]
*  But the reality is that apprehensions of irregular migrants between ports of entry at our border are at a four-year low. They're at the lowest point since September 2020. That is in large part because of an executive order that President Biden signed in June that really first restricted individuals from seeking asylum when encountered between ports of entry at our border. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=222.0s)]
*  So right now, enforcement on our exterior borders is at a relative low compared to what it was last year. That is why, more likely, Trump is going to be very focused on what we call interior enforcement or deporting people who are here illegally. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=246.0s)]
*  I will note that as a former Homeland Security official, I will tell you it takes large teams to find individuals on the interior of this country, take them into detention, and then ultimately find somewhere to deport them to. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=262.0s)]
*  So Trump has said that he will keep families, including families with children, in detention, which is a departure from Biden-era policies, and is very focused on something that we call remain in Mexico, which is requiring individuals to apply for asylum on the Mexican side of the border rather than at a port of entry itself or once encountered by customs and border protection in light of an irregular apprehension. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=273.0s)]
*  And we should see big changes coming from the Trump administration when it comes to those specific areas. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=299.0s)]
*  Sam, you said it was a big campaign promise. Sam Vinograd, we always appreciate your time. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=303.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_ORtGLuvQ&t=310.0s)]
