# China imposes tariffs on U.S. goods, launches investigation into Google
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI)
*  Let's take a closer look though at China's retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=0.0s)]
*  We're talking about a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products and a 10% tariff [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=4.84s)]
*  on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large engine cars. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=12.4s)]
*  These tariffs are set to take effect on Monday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=16.88s)]
*  So let's go live now to CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=19.92s)]
*  Kelly, do all these tariffs spell sticker shock for shoppers? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  When might we start to see those prices go up? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=28.84s)]
*  So this could potentially mean higher prices. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=33.64s)]
*  I don't want to say sticker shock because the tariff on China was 10% versus a much [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=36.36s)]
*  larger tariff that President Trump had been threatening earlier in the campaign as much [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=42.24s)]
*  as 60 to 100%. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=46.28s)]
*  But 10% isn't nothing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=48.36s)]
*  Now, you're not going to see a full 10% when you go to the store and buy a piece of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  clothing that was manufactured in China. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=55.32s)]
*  It would be more along the lines of something less than 10% because what happens is when [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=58.36s)]
*  an American company imports a Chinese product to the U.S., they do pay a 10% tax, but it's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  on that wholesale price. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=69.16s)]
*  And so then they decide how much they're going to pass that on to us, the consumer. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=70.6s)]
*  Now, in terms of how long it could take to go into effect, it really depends on the industry. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  So if there's an industry where inventory is low and they're going to be importing [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=80.96s)]
*  products, sending it to you almost immediately, then yes, you're going to see that 10% [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=86.0s)]
*  tariff in the sticker price that you do buy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=91.76s)]
*  But then there are other industries where it could take six to nine months. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=94.68s)]
*  So it really depends. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=97.68s)]
*  And of course, the hope is some of this is just a negotiation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=98.8s)]
*  The retaliatory tariffs that you mentioned that China put in place don't go into effect [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=102.72s)]
*  until February 10th. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=107.0s)]
*  So it does seem that there may be a window for negotiating there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=108.16s)]
*  Of course, we still got a few more days before February 10th. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=111.52s)]
*  So we'll see what comes out of that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=114.0s)]
*  Now, Kelly, just minutes ago, after U.S. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=115.96s)]
*  Trump's tariffs took effect, China announced its launching an investigation into Google. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=118.4s)]
*  What is that about? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=123.24s)]
*  So we don't have that many details, but the timing was suspect. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=126.72s)]
*  It was literally minutes after the 10% tariff went into effect at midnight this morning. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=130.76s)]
*  So it is an antitrust investigation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=136.6s)]
*  And what that really means is that China is investigating Google for anticompetitive practices. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=139.6s)]
*  Whether this is really going to hurt Google that much, Google doesn't have a very big [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=145.36s)]
*  business in China. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=151.4s)]
*  In fact, back in 2010, they had to stop operating their primary operation of Google.com. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  They do have some engineering and advertising businesses, but it is really small. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=160.04s)]
*  So if there was some kind of penalty in terms of operating or a fee that is a percentage [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=164.52s)]
*  of their business, Google is a very, very small operation in China. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=172.44s)]
*  Got it. And Kelly, another move from President Trump we want to ask you about, because he's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=177.4s)]
*  establishing what's called a sovereign wealth fund, saying it could be used to buy TikTok. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=181.56s)]
*  But I'm wondering this and I'm sure a lot of people are wondering the same thing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=186.44s)]
*  What is a sovereign wealth fund? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=189.76s)]
*  Yes. So it's basically an investment fund that's owned by a country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=192.52s)]
*  And I'll point to other countries like Saudi Arabia, Norway, China that do operate very [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=196.52s)]
*  large and very successful sovereign wealth funds. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=202.68s)]
*  And what this allows a country to do is make investments as a venture fund or another [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=205.08s)]
*  investment private fund would. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=211.96s)]
*  It's kind of like a nest egg, because then you can make those investments and hopefully [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  reap those benefits and reinvest or bring it to other areas of the government. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=218.84s)]
*  I will note most countries fund this from a budget surplus like Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=224.04s)]
*  They're very rich in oil. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=229.24s)]
*  They're able to fund that money towards the sovereign wealth fund. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=230.76s)]
*  The U.S. is operating at a budget deficit. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=233.56s)]
*  So I think a big question would be where would this money even come from to fund that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=236.6s)]
*  that investment fund? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=241.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's a big question indeed. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=243.16s)]
*  Kelly, other news here are following today. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=244.76s)]
*  Waffle House tacking on an extra charge for eggs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=247.24s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  It's the bird flu. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=253.8s)]
*  So they came out with a statement saying that they're going to tack on a 50 cent charge [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=255.8s)]
*  for any egg type of dish that you would order. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=260.92s)]
*  And I don't know about you, but I went to Costco this weekend. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=264.12s)]
*  I couldn't find eggs anywhere. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  Everything was out. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=268.44s)]
*  That's a very common thing that people are finding across the country. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=269.16s)]
*  So many birds, thousands and thousands, have been affected by this flu. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=273.96s)]
*  And so we are seeing that egg shortage that's causing prices to go up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=279.48s)]
*  And that is why you're seeing the move from Waffle House today. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=282.84s)]
*  They did say that when this shortage rolls back, that surcharge will roll back as well. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  But for now, it's in place. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=290.84s)]
*  Well, you and me both, Kelly, because I went to Costco a week ago and couldn't find any eggs. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=292.44s)]
*  But Kelly O'Grady, thank you for making it all make sense for us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=296.28s)]
*  We appreciate your time today. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuo_PYoMJiI&t=299.4s)]
