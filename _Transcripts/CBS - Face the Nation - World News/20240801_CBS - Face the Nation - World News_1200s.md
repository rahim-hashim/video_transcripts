# What to know about 3 Americans to be released as part of major prisoner swap with Russia
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo)
*  If you're just joining us, we've got breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=0.0s)]
*  Three Americans being held by Russia are now on their way home. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=5.12s)]
*  Evan Gurskiewicz, Paul Whelan, and also Kermit Sheva, part of a large prisoner swap with [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=9.52s)]
*  Russia. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=15.64s)]
*  We are awaiting details on the specifics, what prisoners America was willing to release [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=16.64s)]
*  to Russia in exchange for these three Americans. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=22.64s)]
*  We don't know yet. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=25.6s)]
*  We do know this has been in the works for months. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=27.6s)]
*  Apparently, Gurskiewicz, Whelan, and Kermit Sheva right now are on their way to US, hopefully [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  in US custody soon. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=36.76s)]
*  I want to bring in Olivia Gauz, a CBS News intelligence and national security reporter. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=39.24s)]
*  Olivia joins us now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  Olivia, are you with us right now? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=46.04s)]
*  Can you tell us what you know, what you're hearing about how this is all taking place? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  Sure, Michael. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=53.92s)]
*  People who have been intimately involved in what you accurately described as a month-long [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=55.64s)]
*  negotiation have described it to me as one of the most complex in US-Russia history and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=60.0s)]
*  even US-Soviet history, when we of course all know spy swaps hit a crescendo. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=66.36s)]
*  The reason for that is the number of players involved and the number of now political prisoners [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=71.92s)]
*  involved, the US of course disputing that either Evan Gurskiewicz or Paul Whelan were [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=77.2s)]
*  involved in any kind of espionage, finding them both to have been wrongfully detained [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=82.0s)]
*  by the Russians. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=88.24s)]
*  Alcukhryma Sheva, also a journalist of the US, did not officially designate her in the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=89.24s)]
*  course of its investigation to be wrongfully detained, but President Biden personally appealed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=94.92s)]
*  for her release in April of this year, calling her out by name and calling on the Russians [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=100.68s)]
*  to release her. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=106.52s)]
*  Speculation had been mounting that a deal was close when people who monitor prisons [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=108.48s)]
*  in Russia noticed that some high-profile political prisoners had been shifting around, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=113.28s)]
*  had disappeared from rosters. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=118.16s)]
*  Among them was Paul Whelan and another prominent Kremlin critic, Vladimir Kara-Mursa. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  We are still awaiting final details of what this negotiation involved, which prisoners [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=126.0s)]
*  might be going where, but we do expect that these three American citizens expect to see [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=133.56s)]
*  them to step on US soil in a matter of hours tonight. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=138.36s)]
*  And Olivia, remind us, what had Russia charged these Americans with? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=142.16000000000003s)]
*  What were they accused of doing? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=146.0s)]
*  Sure, well, Paul Whelan is the longest-held American in Russia. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=147.8s)]
*  He was detained there in 2018 and accused essentially of espionage, things that his [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  family disputes, that he is vehemently disputed, that the State Department and US government, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  writ large, has disputed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  The same thing with Evan Gershkovich, who traveled to Russia on a reporting trip, was [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=165.56s)]
*  detained there in 2023, accused of espionage, and in both of these men's cases, convicted [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=170.0s)]
*  of these charges and sentenced to long sentences in Russian penal colonies. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=178.56s)]
*  Paul Whelan, of course, serving out a number of years already, and Evan Gershkovich recently [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=184.36s)]
*  sentenced in July. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=189.24s)]
*  Al-Sukur Maseva, in a similar sort of rushed trial earlier in July, was sentenced to six [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  and a half years. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  She was accused of spreading false information about the Russian military. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=198.45999999999998s)]
*  The US administration obviously views all of these as trumped-up charges, and as Russia [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=202.76s)]
*  trying to negotiate for political prisoners, things that it's taken with capris and without [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=206.88s)]
*  real cause. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  These three Americans coming home, obviously a tremendous relief, not just for the families, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  but for all Americans. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=216.64s)]
*  But did Vladimir Putin also get what he wanted, too, in terms of using American lives as bargaining [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  chips to get prisoners released? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=226.22s)]
*  Is this a win for him, too? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=228.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, apart from a win for him, it's not without a cost to the US, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  We are still awaiting the details of who was swapped for whom. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=238.16s)]
*  We do know it's been publicly reported that the Russians have had their eyes on a convicted [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=241.5s)]
*  murderer held in a German prison whose name is Vadim Krasikov. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  That had been their area of focus. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  They had repeatedly expressed interest in getting his release, but he was not in US [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=252.88s)]
*  custody. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=258.53999999999996s)]
*  He was in German custody. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=259.53999999999996s)]
*  So that was obviously a snare in the early negotiations in this deal. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=260.86s)]
*  We again still need to confirm who the Russians exactly are getting in exchange for these [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=265.5s)]
*  three high-profile Americans. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=270.28s)]
*  The Biden administration has managed to secure over the past three and a half years the release [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=272.5s)]
*  of more than 60 hostages and wrongful detainees, but very few of them have attained the level [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=276.94s)]
*  of prominence and gotten the following that these Russian cases have. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=282.02s)]
*  I want to bring in Elizabeth Palmer, CBS News' senior foreign correspondent. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=286.24s)]
*  Elizabeth, you were in court for Paul Whelan's trial in Russia. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=290.1s)]
*  What can you tell us about how that process played out? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=293.64s)]
*  It was back in the winter of 2018, and Paul Whelan looked blindsided. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=298.62s)]
*  The circumstances of his arrest were very peculiar. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=303.78s)]
*  He'd made friends online with some members of the Russian military. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=307.02s)]
*  He's an ex-Marine, US Marine. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=311.06s)]
*  And eventually one of them had invited him to a wedding in Moscow. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=314.24s)]
*  So he went, and as a wedding guest, he'd come down into the lobby of his hotel, and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=318.24s)]
*  suddenly the FSB showed up and arrested him and said that he had had a thumb drive in [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=323.78s)]
*  his pocket full of classified material. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=329.7s)]
*  Now, we never saw evidence of that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=332.34s)]
*  His family says he never saw evidence of it either. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=335.11999999999995s)]
*  And just as in Gurskavich's case, we were never allowed to stay in the courtroom past [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=338.05999999999995s)]
*  the first few minutes, which was kind of a photo op where we got to see Paul Whelan. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=345.34s)]
*  He was standing in the dock, that prisoner's dock, in the Russian style behind glass, and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=350.24s)]
*  he just looked completely stunned. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=357.16s)]
*  He couldn't believe it was happening. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  He then went away and spent almost six years in a Russian jail. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=363.3s)]
*  So he has been the longest incarcerated, and I noticed looking at him, he has lost quite [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=368.3s)]
*  a lot of weight since those first few days. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=374.32s)]
*  But he still looks pretty well, actually, considering what's happened in the meantime. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=377.6s)]
*  His case was a little diplomatically difficult because, although he'd been a U.S. service [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  member, he also held a Canadian and Irish passport. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  And so there was some diplomatic shuffle trying to figure out which government needed to go [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=392.5s)]
*  to bat for him. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=396.76000000000005s)]
*  And certainly the U.S. had the most power and influence and in the end has really stepped [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  up. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=404.6s)]
*  And today his family will be ecstatic to think that he's finally on the way home. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=405.6s)]
*  Well Elizabeth, it was just about two weeks ago that Evan Gurskiewicz was sentenced in [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=411.92s)]
*  Russia. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=415.64000000000004s)]
*  What can you tell us about that process? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=416.64000000000004s)]
*  That may have been the very first inkling we had that a deal was being cooked up because [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  he should have been not tried yet. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=427.08000000000004s)]
*  In other words, his original court date was later this month. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=430.56s)]
*  And suddenly we got news that it had been moved ahead, a full month, at the request [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=433.78s)]
*  of his defense lawyers. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=438.78s)]
*  And we know that the Russians had floated the idea of this prisoner swap, but had said [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=441.02s)]
*  categorically it couldn't take place until Gurskiewicz's trial was over. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=445.02s)]
*  So the defense lawyers saying, all right, let's get it underway, was a signal that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=449.91999999999996s)]
*  they needed a sentence in order to move on to freedom. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=454.62s)]
*  And indeed as soon as that sentence was delivered, it was very harsh, 16 years, there began to [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=460.09999999999997s)]
*  be a little bit of buzz around the fact that the talks were really going to come to fruition [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=466.7s)]
*  and he too would be on his way home. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=473.5s)]
*  His parents, I can't imagine how thrilled and relieved they are. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=475.38s)]
*  And we have focused on the three Americans, but there's also a prominent British citizen [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=480.53999999999996s)]
*  with U.S. ties being released. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=484.14s)]
*  What can you tell us about him? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=485.62s)]
*  Vladimir Kara-Murza, he is a longtime dissident, incredibly brave. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=488.22s)]
*  He's long worked on human rights issues and in fact earned the respect of John McCain, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=495.7s)]
*  Senator McCain. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=501.78000000000003s)]
*  And shortly before McCain's death, he asked in an email whether Kara-Murza would be one [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  of the pallbearers. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=509.34000000000003s)]
*  So if you look at the photographs of Senator McCain's funeral now, you'll see Vladimir [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=510.34000000000003s)]
*  Kara-Murza among the pallbearers, along with President Biden incidentally. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=516.38s)]
*  He then, even from jail, began to write, kept on writing very punchy and well-reasoned critiques [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=521.3000000000001s)]
*  of Putin's government and the gross human rights abuses that were continuing. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=532.3000000000001s)]
*  And in fact won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary for those writings. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=539.84s)]
*  He believes he was poisoned twice by the FSB, maybe as a warning. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=545.86s)]
*  But he survived both times, though his health is thought to be very fragile. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=554.02s)]
*  So it's of particular, I think, relief to his family that he's getting out of Russian [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=560.62s)]
*  custody because he won't have been getting the medical care that he needed to, you know, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=565.04s)]
*  to thrive. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=571.28s)]
*  Elizabeth, at this point, do we have any sense of who the Russians could be getting in return? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=573.02s)]
*  Well, the only name is the one that Olivia mentioned, Vadim Krasikov. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=577.52s)]
*  He's been at the top of the list for a long time, and that indicates that the Germans [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=585.4s)]
*  have agreed to be part of this swap because they're the ones who have him in custody. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=589.72s)]
*  There's also some speculation in the Russian press that there will be a handful of Russian [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=594.52s)]
*  spies disguised as diplomats who've been arrested over the years, one in Norway perhaps, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=601.36s)]
*  another one somewhere in Europe, and they will be sent home as opposed to having to [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=607.96s)]
*  cool their heels in European jails. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=614.6400000000001s)]
*  But that, their details on that are very scant at the moment. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=617.1600000000001s)]
*  We're just going to have to wait and see. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=620.24s)]
*  I want to bring Olivia back in. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=622.58s)]
*  A deal like this, a massive prisoner swap, can you talk about how many agencies, and [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=624.24s)]
*  this is not just multiple agencies in the U.S., but also multiple countries involved? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=631.52s)]
*  How large is the scope of a deal like this? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=636.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=638.8s)]
*  Well, I think we're still awaiting details on who exactly was involved, but we do know [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=639.8s)]
*  multiple government agencies, including the White House, the State Department, and the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  CIA, which has what's referred to as a special channel with the Russians in order to discuss [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  swaps like these. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=652.76s)]
*  Given the longstanding, again, history going back to Soviet times when spy swaps were much [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=654.3599999999999s)]
*  more frequent, this scenario is different. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  It is not a spy swap. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=663.88s)]
*  This again appears to involve a number of political prisoners, which makes it more fraught [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=665.4799999999999s)]
*  because there's nothing to acknowledge in terms of wrongdoing. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=669.88s)]
*  In fact, the U.S. has maintained that Alsou and Evan and Paul have been completely innocent [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=674.4799999999999s)]
*  in all of these cases. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=679.76s)]
*  In Whalen's case, I want to highlight in particular, I mean, Liz just laid out exactly why this [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=682.16s)]
*  is so poignant for him. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=686.2s)]
*  Also why, because he was passed over effectively twice in prior negotiations that U.S. administrations [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=688.08s)]
*  engaged in. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=694.16s)]
*  Trevor Reed was released in a swap for a Russian pilot in 2022. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=695.5600000000001s)]
*  And then Brittany Greiner, the WNBA star, was released in December of 2023 in exchange [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=700.34s)]
*  for a known Russian arms dealer, Victor Boot. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=705.76s)]
*  All while Paul continued to be held in Russia. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=709.48s)]
*  So the fact that he is being released today is also a result of pressure mounting on the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=712.9200000000001s)]
*  administration. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=720.24s)]
*  You cannot leave him behind once again. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=721.24s)]
*  And in fact, U.S. officials have been speaking publicly to the fact that they are absolutely [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=723.52s)]
*  determined to bring both Paul and Evan home. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=727.5600000000001s)]
*  Earlier this month, the national security adviser Jake Sullivan said as much on stage [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=731.0s)]
*  an aspirin conference where he said the U.S. and President Biden were determined to bring [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=736.24s)]
*  both of them home. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=740.96s)]
*  He spoke elliptically about possibly a deadline at the end of this month, which raised some [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  eyebrows in the audience. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=747.0s)]
*  And the special hostage envoy Roger Carstens also spoke publicly about these efforts to [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=748.8s)]
*  free both men, in addition to also in dealing with the Russians. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=754.28s)]
*  Well, Olivia, you bring up a good point because I remember it was just last month, July 4th, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=758.24s)]
*  the Whelan family said that Paul Whelan is spending another Independence Day in Russian [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=762.68s)]
*  prison. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  How hard, we've talked about how hard the government has been working for this deal. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=769.3199999999999s)]
*  How hard have the families been working? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=773.76s)]
*  What have they had to do to try and keep their loved ones in the spotlight? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=776.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=780.0799999999999s)]
*  In Paul's case, it really has been a family effort. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=781.5s)]
*  And Liz spoke to it as well. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=784.4399999999999s)]
*  His brother has been working very hard to maintain contact with press outlets. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=786.68s)]
*  They understand that keeping his name in the press keeps him relevant and keeps attention [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=792.12s)]
*  on his situation. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=797.0s)]
*  They would always send updates when he underwent a transfer, when he was beaten in prison, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=798.6600000000001s)]
*  which happened. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=803.8000000000001s)]
*  He managed to, in recent weeks, secure a Russian cell phone and was managing to call members [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=805.24s)]
*  of the press and U.S. government officials, including the special hostage envoy, to provide [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=811.14s)]
*  an update on his case and hopefully get an update on where things stand for him. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=816.0s)]
*  Of course, it's an open line. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=820.9599999999999s)]
*  Russian officials are listening in the entire time, so you can't explain all of it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=822.88s)]
*  But he has been trying to reach out and personally make his case to U.S. government officials [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=828.28s)]
*  and press. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=834.54s)]
*  His sister, Elizabeth, has consistently traveled to Washington in order to advocate for his [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=835.54s)]
*  release, again, getting in government officials' faces in order to say, you can't pass over [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=840.5999999999999s)]
*  Paul another time. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=844.9399999999999s)]
*  Elizabeth, I want to go back to you. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=846.4399999999999s)]
*  As I understand it, you've spoken to the Whelan family. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=849.44s)]
*  Can you tell us what you've heard? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=851.96s)]
*  His brother lives in Toronto, and he has been leading the charge, trying to keep Paul's [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=855.58s)]
*  case front and center. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=861.6800000000001s)]
*  He was tireless, very much encouraged by the American embassy in Russia while it was able [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=864.2800000000001s)]
*  to. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=872.2s)]
*  The American ambassador kept visiting Whelan, kept visiting Whelan. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=873.2s)]
*  Even during the years of COVID, when, I think, to Paul Whelan, he must have felt that he [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=877.42s)]
*  was forgotten about, his brother was a very good correspondent. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=883.38s)]
*  He is eloquent in his emails. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=889.58s)]
*  And I think he, more than anybody, managed to keep this case alive and will deserve a [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=891.9s)]
*  huge amount of the credit, and I'm sure Paul's gratitude, when he finally gets to give him [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=898.24s)]
*  a great big hug. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=904.44s)]
*  It's a tremendous relief, I think, for all Americans. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=907.34s)]
*  Olivia, I want to ask about the significance of this prisoner swap. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=909.9s)]
*  We're talking about 24 prisoners. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=914.26s)]
*  Now, we have cut deals with Russia before the U.S. government. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=916.66s)]
*  This is a pretty large-scale deal. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=921.44s)]
*  Is this the largest in recent memory? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=924.22s)]
*  It is the most complex in recent memory. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=927.46s)]
*  Officials who were involved in the negotiations described it to me as the most complex in [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=931.34s)]
*  precisely because of the number of players involved and the type of prisoners involved here. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=936.62s)]
*  We talked about the agencies that are involved, the White House, the State Department, the CIA. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=946.22s)]
*  All of them would have had discrete roles in dealing with the Russians in trying to [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=951.42s)]
*  secure these prisoners' release. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=955.66s)]
*  And as you were talking with Ambassador Sullivan earlier, there is, of course, a cost that [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=958.34s)]
*  the U.S. always factors into these decisions that they make, right? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=963.5s)]
*  They look closely as to whether the people that they may be releasing go back to a life [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=966.98s)]
*  of crime, whether they go back and pose a threat to the United States. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=971.58s)]
*  And when the special hostage envoy was speaking earlier this month, he said, in recent years, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=975.58s)]
*  that has not been the case. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=980.34s)]
*  The calculus that the U.S. has made in order to make these exchanges has wound up being [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=981.5s)]
*  relatively safe in terms of U.S. interests. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=986.26s)]
*  It has paid off in terms of getting Americans home and releasing, in some cases, the convicted [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=988.54s)]
*  criminals that they have released in order to secure Americans' freedom. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=993.62s)]
*  And right now we are joined on the phone by John Sullivan. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=998.6999999999999s)]
*  He was U.S. Ambassador to Russia from 2020 to 2022, and he is now a CBS News contributor. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1001.54s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, thanks for joining us on the phone. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1007.2199999999999s)]
*  First, I want to get your reaction to this prisoner swap, the release of these Americans. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1009.5s)]
*  Well, thanks. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1014.3399999999999s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1015.3399999999999s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1016.3399999999999s)]
*  This is literally a big deal. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1019.14s)]
*  Lots of moving parts, different countries involved, complex not just for the U.S. government, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1022.14s)]
*  all the different agencies that were mentioned, but different countries involved, which makes [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1027.82s)]
*  this really unusual. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1033.06s)]
*  And the scale, the number of people who are being moved today, it is large, it is impactful. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1034.06s)]
*  But it comes at a cost to the United States. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1042.02s)]
*  The United States is releasing convicted Russian criminals. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1044.34s)]
*  And as I understand it, there's an SSB colonel. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1048.6599999999999s)]
*  The SSB is the principal successor to the KGB, who is in custody in Berlin, serving [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1052.78s)]
*  a life sentence for murder, sent to commit a murder by the Russian government in Berlin. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1059.22s)]
*  So there is a cost to the United States and to our allies, but the calculus that was made [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1066.6999999999998s)]
*  was that getting all of these people out, including someone like Paul Whelan, whom I [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1072.46s)]
*  consider a friend, he and his family, who's been detained for almost six years now, it's [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1076.82s)]
*  a great day for them and their families. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1082.98s)]
*  Well, Ambassador, I think anytime Americans come home safely, it's cause for celebration. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1084.66s)]
*  But does this also give incentive to Vladimir Putin to do this again, to take Americans [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1089.74s)]
*  as bargaining chips to get more prisoners released in the future? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1096.1s)]
*  Of course it does. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1099.98s)]
*  This does not signal a change in U.S.-Russia relations. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1100.98s)]
*  The way I would characterize it, the way I would think of it from Putin's perspective, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1104.66s)]
*  Putin believes he's at war with the United States. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1109.42s)]
*  He would treat this as basically an exchange of prisoners of war during wartime. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1113.06s)]
*  There's no improvement in U.S.-Russia relations. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1118.58s)]
*  U.S. citizens in Moscow, in Russia, are at risk of being detained without cause and used [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1121.58s)]
*  by the Russian government for trades just like this. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1128.9399999999998s)]
*  Ambassador, if you can give us some context as to the state of U.S.-Russia relations. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1132.58s)]
*  I've heard it said that we're at the lowest point since the Cold War. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1138.06s)]
*  Do you think that's accurate? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1141.54s)]
*  No. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1143.34s)]
*  If it's from the Cold War, this is the lowest point it's been in my lifetime, which predates [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1144.34s)]
*  the end of the Cold War. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1151.78s)]
*  It's as bad as one could possibly imagine. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1154.78s)]
*  I speak a lot about the war in Ukraine and U.S.-Russia relations, and particularly to [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1157.46s)]
*  an American audience as I describe the situation, U.S.-Russia relations, the state of the war. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1163.54s)]
*  I start off by saying as bad as you think it is, it's even worse than you think. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1170.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, Ambassador, we're going to continue this conversation with us. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1175.26s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1180.14s)]
*  We're learning more details all the time about this massive prisoner swap that's going to [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1181.8600000000001s)]
*  lead to the release of Paul Whelan, Evan Gurskavich, Alsu Kurma-Shava, three Americans held in [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1186.62s)]
*  Russia now on their way home. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1193.06s)]
*  We're going to take a short break, and we'll have more details for you coming up. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0rw4bNiAo&t=1195.54s)]
