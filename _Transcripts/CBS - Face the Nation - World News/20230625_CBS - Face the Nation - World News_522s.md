# Secretary Blinken says "we haven't seen the last act yet" in Russia's Wagner rebellion
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss)
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is one of the many top Biden administration officials [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=0.0s)]
*  who's been monitoring the events of the last two days and he joins us from the State Department. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=4.7s)]
*  Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=9.56s)]
*  Morning Margaret. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=11.8s)]
*  Can you tell us who in the Biden administration has been in touch with Russian leadership? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=13.44s)]
*  Well I instructed my own team at the President's behest to engage with the Russians first and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=18.96s)]
*  foremost to make sure that they understood their responsibilities in terms of protecting [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=24.04s)]
*  our own personnel, ensuring their safety and well-being as well as any American citizens [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=29.34s)]
*  in Russia. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=34.18s)]
*  So a number of people have engaged to make sure that the Russians got that message. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=35.18s)]
*  Is the U.S. ready for further unrest in Russia and the scenario that Vladimir Putin does [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=40.62s)]
*  not remain in power? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=46.22s)]
*  Margaret, this is an unfolding story and I think we're in the midst of a moving picture. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  We haven't seen the last act. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  We're watching it very closely and carefully. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=55.260000000000005s)]
*  Just step back for a second and put this in context. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=57.419999999999995s)]
*  Sixteen months ago Russian forces were on the doorstep of Kiev in Ukraine thinking they'd [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=59.94s)]
*  take the city in a matter of days, thinking they would erase Ukraine from the map as an [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=65.66s)]
*  independent country. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=69.3s)]
*  Now, over this weekend, they've had to defend Moscow, Russia's capital, against mercenaries [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=70.3s)]
*  of Putin's own making. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=76.02s)]
*  Prigozhin himself in this entire incident has raised profound questions about the very [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=77.94s)]
*  premises for Russia's aggression against Ukraine in the first place, saying that Ukraine [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=83.42s)]
*  or NATO did not pose a threat to Russia, which is part of Putin's narrative, and it was a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=87.3s)]
*  direct challenge to Putin's authority. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=91.54s)]
*  So this raises profound questions. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=93.02s)]
*  It shows real cracks. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=95.58s)]
*  We can't speculate or know exactly where that's going to go. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=97.8s)]
*  We do know that Putin has a lot more to answer for in the weeks and months ahead. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=100.6s)]
*  But is the U.S. prepared for the potential of the fall of the Putin government and is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  their nuclear stockpile the largest in the world secure? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=110.18s)]
*  We always prepare for every contingency. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=114.62s)]
*  In terms of what happens in Russia, it's an internal matter for the Russians to figure [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=117.54s)]
*  out. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=122.62s)]
*  Of course, when we're dealing with a major power, and especially a major power that has [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=123.62s)]
*  nuclear weapons, that's something that's of concern, something we're very focused on. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=126.94000000000001s)]
*  We haven't seen any change in Russia's nuclear posture. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=132.10000000000002s)]
*  There hasn't been any change in ours, but it's something we're going to watch very, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=135.02s)]
*  very carefully. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=137.74s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is appearing on television this morning, but it appears to have been [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=138.74s)]
*  prerecorded. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=144.46s)]
*  Do you know the whereabouts of Vladimir Putin right now? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=146.06s)]
*  Is he in Moscow? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=149.02s)]
*  I don't want to speculate on that or what information that we have. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=151.38s)]
*  Again, we're watching that carefully. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=157.22s)]
*  I think one of the things this tells you is that we still don't have finality in terms [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=160.54000000000002s)]
*  of what was actually agreed between Prugosian and Putin. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=167.12s)]
*  I suspect that we're going to learn more in the days and weeks ahead about what deal they [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=172.12s)]
*  struck. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=176.56s)]
*  The president brought together not only the national security cabinet yesterday, he brought [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=177.56s)]
*  together the leaders of our key allies and partners. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=181.4s)]
*  He instructed all of us to do the same. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=184.56s)]
*  We have tremendous unity of purpose and unity of action when it comes to supporting Ukraine, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=187.12s)]
*  and that's where our focus is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  As you just said, Prugosian drew into question the very premise for Vladimir Putin's war. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=193.72s)]
*  Do the Wagner fighters return to the fight in Ukraine? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=200.44s)]
*  Do we know? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=204.3s)]
*  Too soon to tell what's going to happen to the Wagner forces, whether they go back to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=206.3s)]
*  the fight. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=209.48s)]
*  I mean, it was extraordinary that they were moving out of Ukraine and into Russia, but [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=210.48s)]
*  it's too soon to tell whether they're going to go back into the fight as Wagner, whether [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=214.32s)]
*  they get integrated into regular Russian forces, what this means for Wagner and other parts [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=218.0s)]
*  of the world. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=221.78s)]
*  Both Putin and Prugosian are responsible for committing terrible acts in Ukraine against [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=223.62s)]
*  Ukrainian civilians, but also in the case of Wagner, in country after country in Africa, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=227.58s)]
*  wherever Wagner is, death and destruction and exploitation follow. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=232.98s)]
*  But all of this is likely to unroll in the coming days and the coming weeks to the extent [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=236.74s)]
*  that it presents a real distraction for Putin and for Russian authorities, that they have [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=242.98s)]
*  to look at, sort of mind their rear, even as they're trying to deal with the counteroffensive [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=249.32s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  I think that creates even greater openings for the Ukrainians to do well on the ground. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, as you just indicated, Yevgeny Prugosian has a footprint that goes from Africa to Syria [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=258.84s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=265.48s)]
*  Do you have any idea where he is right now? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=266.48s)]
*  I can't get into what we know or don't know through intelligence. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=270.88s)]
*  It's something that we're looking at and that we're tracking. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=274.76s)]
*  One of the things Prugosian did was directly undermine the Russian military leadership. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=277.52s)]
*  Do we know who is in charge of the Russian military right now? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  And how could Vladimir Putin agree to any changes in the leadership of his military [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=285.79999999999995s)]
*  and still look like he's in charge? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=291.64s)]
*  Those are great questions, and I think we'll get the answers in the days and weeks ahead. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  It's too soon to say with any certainty what the final chapter in this particular book [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=298.76s)]
*  is going to be. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=304.32s)]
*  The rising storm of Prugosian inside of Russia is something that many people have seen over [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=306.88s)]
*  months now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=313.0s)]
*  Direct challenges to the military leadership, powerful criticism of Russia's conduct of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=314.48s)]
*  its aggression against Ukraine, and now questioning the very premises of the war. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=319.64s)]
*  Prugosian himself saying that Ukraine and NATO did not pose a threat to Russia, which [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=325.44s)]
*  has, as you know, been part of Putin's narrative. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=329.52s)]
*  These create more cracks in the Russian facade, and those cracks are already profound economically, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=332.36s)]
*  militarily. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=339.12s)]
*  It's standing in the world. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=340.12s)]
*  All of those things have been dramatically diminished by Putin's aggression against Ukraine. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=341.76s)]
*  He's managed to bring Europe together. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=346.64s)]
*  He's managed to bring NATO together. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  He's managed to get Europe to move off of Russian energy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  He's managed to alienate Ukrainians and unite Ukraine at the same time. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=352.68s)]
*  So across the board, this has been a strategic failure. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  Now you introduce into that profound internal divisions, and there are lots of questions [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=359.68s)]
*  he's going to have to answer in the weeks ahead. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=363.64s)]
*  Is there a possibility of civil war? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=366.38s)]
*  I don't want to speculate on that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=368.74s)]
*  These are fundamentally internal matters for the Russians to figure out. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=371.32s)]
*  It's not our place to do that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=376.98s)]
*  Will President Biden reach out directly to Vladimir Putin? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=378.4s)]
*  Has the CIA director reached out to Russian intelligence? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=382.14s)]
*  Margaret, I'm not going to get into any diplomatic contacts that we may have or have had. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=386.56s)]
*  I can tell you that on my instruction, on the President's instruction, we had some [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=391.6s)]
*  engagement with the Russians over the weekend to make sure they understood their responsibilities [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=395.88s)]
*  when it comes to looking out for the safety and security of our personnel in Russia. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=399.92s)]
*  Very important that we do that, and we did that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=403.76s)]
*  I want to ask you about Beijing. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=406.0s)]
*  I was there with you earlier this week, and I listened to you pick every single one of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=408.68s)]
*  your words very carefully. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=413.2s)]
*  And then on our way home, President Biden called Xi Jinping a dictator with economic [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=415.44s)]
*  problems who didn't know what his own military was doing by flying the spy balloon over the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=421.16s)]
*  United States. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=426.44s)]
*  How much did that hurt the work you did? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=427.6s)]
*  Margaret, one of the things that I think you heard me say during the trip and after the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=430.16s)]
*  trip is that the main purpose was to bring some greater stability to the relationship. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=434.36s)]
*  But one of the things that I said to Chinese counterparts during this trip was that we [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=439.94s)]
*  are going to continue to do things and say things that you don't like, just as you're [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=443.68s)]
*  no doubt going to continue to do and say things that we don't like. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=449.08s)]
*  And if you look at what comes out of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on a daily basis, you'll [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=451.68s)]
*  hear that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=455.8s)]
*  The president always speaks candidly. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=458.44s)]
*  He speaks directly. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=460.3s)]
*  He speaks clearly and he speaks for all of us. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=461.64s)]
*  You also said that Chinese officials assured you they won't provide lethal assistance to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=463.62s)]
*  Russia but that Chinese companies are. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv--S1cTJss&t=468.4s)]
