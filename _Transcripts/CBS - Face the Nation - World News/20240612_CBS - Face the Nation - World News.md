# Biden arrives in Italy for G7 summit with Ukraine top of mind
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA)
*  Fresh off his trip to France to mark 80 years since the D-Day invasion, President Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=0.0s)]
*  has made his way back across the Atlantic Ocean. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  He landed in Italy just a short time ago for the G7 summit. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=7.58s)]
*  The meeting of world leaders kicks off tomorrow on the docket, among other things, continued [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=11.72s)]
*  support for Ukraine, dealing with and possibly comprehending the spread of artificial intelligence [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=16.34s)]
*  and migration issues across Europe. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=21.7s)]
*  Nancy Cordes joins us now from Bavaria, Italy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=24.42s)]
*  Nancy, very good to see you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=27.38s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=28.78s)]
*  For the president, what is among the issues he wants to deal with and perhaps advance [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=30.46s)]
*  while at the G7? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, Major, I think Ukraine will be front and center, not just for President Biden, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  but for a number of the leaders who are gathered here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=45.06s)]
*  These are, as you mentioned, the leaders of seven of the largest economies in the world, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=48.36s)]
*  the largest democracies in the world. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=53.28s)]
*  They tend to see eye to eye on issues like this, and they are unified in their desire [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=54.96s)]
*  to show that their commitment to Ukraine is unwavering. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=61.22s)]
*  And so President Zelensky of Ukraine is actually going to be here in Italy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=65.6s)]
*  He will be meeting with President Biden tomorrow, and they're going to be signing a long-term [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=70.52s)]
*  security agreement that basically commits the U.S. to supporting Ukraine militarily [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=76.16s)]
*  with weaponry, with training for soldiers and the like for 10 more years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=82.7s)]
*  This is a negotiation that has been taking place for months. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. is not the first country to sign an agreement like this by a long shot. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=92.30000000000001s)]
*  I think it's the 16th country. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  But what this does, Major, is provide Zelensky with more certainty that the U.S. is going [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=99.62s)]
*  to stand by Ukraine as this war drags on. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=106.48s)]
*  It's also meant to send a message to Vladimir Putin that the United States isn't going anywhere. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=109.92s)]
*  To what degree, Nancy, will the ongoing battle between Israel and Hamas factor into the G7 [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=116.52s)]
*  deliberations, or is that something that the president, though he has people working on [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=123.68s)]
*  that issue, would like to keep largely out of the conversation if possible? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=127.8s)]
*  It's certain to come up, especially because the negotiations between Hamas and Israel [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=133.92s)]
*  are at such a delicate stage. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=140.42s)]
*  But the challenge with the Israel issue in particular is that while these G7 countries [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=143.42s)]
*  are united on many things, Israel is not one of them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  So the U.S., for example, has pledged its support to Israel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=154.14s)]
*  Spain feels very differently. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=159.22s)]
*  Japan would probably like to stay out of the issue altogether. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=161.68s)]
*  So this isn't one of those issues where you're going to see a lot of developments, where [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=164.98000000000002s)]
*  everyone sort of shakes hands on a policy position the way that they would have on Ukraine [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=170.28s)]
*  and comes out with some kind of communique at the end of the summit to discuss how they [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=175.4s)]
*  all feel about this issue. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=179.94s)]
*  This is one of those issues that will probably get pushed to the side in favor of things [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  like artificial intelligence. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=186.08s)]
*  That's such a big topic here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=187.9s)]
*  That is, at the end of the day, really an economic summit that is of great concern to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=190.66s)]
*  the host country, Italy, where we are right now this year, because of concerns about what [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=195.98s)]
*  AI could mean for labor in the future. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=201.54s)]
*  Could it make workers obsolete? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=205.18s)]
*  In fact, the president of Italy feels so strongly about this issue that she invited the pope [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=206.78s)]
*  to attend the G7 summit and meet with world leaders as well. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=212.22s)]
*  So we'll see the pope here talking to the president, talking to various prime ministers [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=217.08s)]
*  over the next couple of days, because this is an issue that he has said he wants to lead [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=222.2s)]
*  on as well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=226.68s)]
*  Nancy, as you were speaking, we are showing live pictures of President Biden's arrival [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=227.68s)]
*  at the G7 summit, just disembarking, coming down the stairs of Air Force One. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=232.04s)]
*  I want to talk to you about economics, because you picked up on that a second ago. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=235.96s)]
*  The European Central Bank this week lowered interest rates. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=238.88s)]
*  European economies compared to the United States, not as strong. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=241.84s)]
*  Will there be any sort of reflections, public or private, from the president about the comparative [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=245.12s)]
*  advantages the U.S. economy currently enjoys against its European rivals? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=250.32s)]
*  Not pressing it too hard, but letting people know America is doing comparatively better. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=254.62s)]
*  That's an argument he likes to make at home. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=261.26s)]
*  Not sure how well it would go over diplomatically if he were to make that case here, where he's [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  going to be linking arms with these other world leaders. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=268.7s)]
*  I will tell you that one economic issue that they will be discussing and hoping to reach [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=271.72s)]
*  some kind of agreement on is how to help Ukraine financially utilizing the $260 billion worth [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=275.92s)]
*  of Russian assets that are currently frozen all over the world, primarily in Europe. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=286.5s)]
*  As you can imagine, all that money kicks off some interest every year to the tune of $2 [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=293.0s)]
*  billion or $3 billion. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=300.66s)]
*  All of these leaders have been working for quite some time to figure out a way that that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=302.66s)]
*  money could be used to help Ukraine expand its own manufacturing sector, its own weapons [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=307.18s)]
*  sector so that it could build more of its own weapons instead of relying on other countries. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=316.1s)]
*  They want to infuse Ukraine with $50 billion or so this year. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=320.70000000000005s)]
*  They're trying to figure out how to do that, how to work through all the logistics of that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=326.08s)]
*  So that'll be a big topic of conversation here as well over the next couple of days. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=330.08s)]
*  A very key point. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=334.24s)]
*  Nancy Kordes, thank you for bringing that up. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=335.24s)]
*  We appreciate it very, very much. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWcoYnSQVeA&t=336.84s)]
