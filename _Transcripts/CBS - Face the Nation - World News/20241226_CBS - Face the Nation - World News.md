# Investigation underway into cause of deadly Kazakhstan plane crash
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q)
*  Our top story this hour, investigators are looking into whether Russian anti-aircraft [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  defenses may have played a role in the deadly plane crash in Kazakhstan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  At least 38 people are dead. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=9.68s)]
*  Right now, the number of survivors stands at 67. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=11.96s)]
*  But many questions still remain about why the plane was diverted and what led to this [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=15.64s)]
*  emergency situation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  The plane was flying from Azerbaijan to Russia when it was diverted and crashed in Kazakhstan [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  on the shore of the Caspian Sea. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=27.04s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Lifsay has more. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=29.36s)]
*  Well, there are indeed new developments in the plane crash in Kazakhstan as investigators [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=32.16s)]
*  now suspect Russian anti-aircraft defenses may have been involved. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=37.76s)]
*  This theory emerged after radar data revealed missile activity in the area at the time of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=43.92s)]
*  the crash. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  While Russia has yet to comment, aviation experts say this could point to a misfire. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=49.72s)]
*  Authorities in Kazakhstan are working with Russian investigators, but tensions are rising [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=56.56s)]
*  over who will lead that inquiry. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=61.96s)]
*  The Embraer 190 jet went down on Christmas Day just off the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=65.28s)]
*  Rescuers described a chaotic scene as they pulled survivors from the wreckage, some of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=74.48s)]
*  them missing their shoes. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=80.56s)]
*  The jet split in half and flipped upside down, laid scattered across the ground with debris [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=83.04s)]
*  and casualties stretching for hundreds of feet in this remote part of Central Asia. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=89.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, search teams have recovered critical components of the aircraft, including the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  black boxes, which are expected to provide more answers in the coming days. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=102.8s)]
*  Now the model of jet, the ERJ-190, is made by a Brazilian company. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=109.2s)]
*  JetBlue is the biggest American company that uses this model, but it had already said it [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  was planning on retiring this model of jet next year. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=121.56s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=126.16s)]
*  Chris Libsay, thank you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h247SjfEu0Q&t=127.88s)]
