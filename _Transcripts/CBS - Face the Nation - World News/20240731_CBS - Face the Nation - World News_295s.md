# Protests over Venezuela election results turn deadly
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4)
*  And we have this update for you. At least 16 people now were reportedly killed amid [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=0.0s)]
*  violent political protests in Venezuela following the presidential election there. Demonstrators [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=7.78s)]
*  are demanding authoritarian ruler Nicolas Maduro accept defeat. He, though, is claiming [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=13.94s)]
*  victory, while the opposition says it has evidence showing they actually won. President [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=19.22s)]
*  Biden and other world leaders are calling on the government to release the voting data [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=24.64s)]
*  from Sunday's election. CBS News correspondent Christian Benavides joins us now from Florida [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  with more on this. And I want to start Christian by asking what specific evidence is being [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=34.6s)]
*  presented by either side and ultimately who will determine who won? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=39.68s)]
*  Errol, that is yet to be seen. Who will ultimately determine who won? The election officials [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=47.6s)]
*  in Venezuela have declared Maduro the winner, but who will win out of this power struggle [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=55.16s)]
*  that's currently taking place? That's what's yet to be seen. Now, the Maduro regime says [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=61.08s)]
*  that he won by about 51% of the vote, but they haven't released any of the tallies [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=66.52s)]
*  from polling centers. And that's what the international community is calling for him [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=72.52s)]
*  to do, him and his government to do, to essentially release the data from each of the polling [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=78.08s)]
*  precincts. Now, on the other side, Maria Corina Machado, who is an opposition leader, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=83.32s)]
*  she is not the opposition candidate, but is certainly the leader of the opposition. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=87.96s)]
*  She says that they have obtained that the opposition has obtained about 84% of the printout [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  tallies from those polling centers and that those show an overwhelming victory by Edmundo [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  Gonzalez, who is the opposition candidate. In fact, according to the tallies that they've [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=106.16s)]
*  released, it's about a two to one victory for the opposition, which has led to these [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=111.44s)]
*  mass protests that are taking place in Venezuela. And we've seen that the government has cracked [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=117.52s)]
*  down hard and violently, as you mentioned, 16 people, according to NGOs on the ground, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=123.44s)]
*  have died during these protests. And this was also interesting, Christian, I understand [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=130.64s)]
*  nearly a third of Venezuelans have fled the country since the beginning of the Maduro [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=135.56s)]
*  regime and hundreds of thousands of them have come here to the U.S. where you are, some [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=140.44s)]
*  of them in Florida. What are you hearing from them about their reaction to the election [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=145.04s)]
*  and the protests? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=150.08s)]
*  Errol, 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled their homeland, about 10% of them approximately [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  since 2014. It's thought are here in the U.S. Many of them end up here. This is Miami Suburb, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  Doral. Right behind me is a restaurant where a number of people gathered yesterday to talk [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=169.4s)]
*  about the election results. What's so interesting is when you speak to Venezuelans who are living [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  here in the states, they'll tell you that what they want to do is go home. But because [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=181.16000000000003s)]
*  of the instability in Venezuela, inflation over 100,000% is how much it's increased. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=186.52s)]
*  The conditions of living are not possible for so many Venezuelans. They can't find food. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  They are forced in many cases to leave their home to be able to just have a normal life. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=201.48s)]
*  We spoke to one woman who said that she spent 10 years, she was born in Venezuela, spent 10 [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  years protesting the government, finally made a decision to move here to Doral. This is what she [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=215.56s)]
*  had to say about the unfolding situation in Venezuela. They are fighting, but we don't have [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=223.4s)]
*  in our side the military section. I wonder when Maduro says that he won the election by 51% of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=230.44s)]
*  the vote, what do you say? He's totally wrong. He's a liar. In fact, the Carter Center overnight [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=239.4s)]
*  releasing a statement saying that these elections cannot be considered democratic. Even [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=249.16s)]
*  left-leaning governments in Latin America have come out, notably Brazil, Lula de Silva, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=254.6s)]
*  and in Colombia, Gustavo Petro calling for this to be a transparent election, for all the tally [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=261.0s)]
*  results to be released. So far, the government in Venezuela has refused to do that, something that, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=268.28s)]
*  as I mentioned, they've done in past elections, the precinct by precinct numbers of those tallies [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=274.44s)]
*  and the opposition saying that the tallies that they've obtained, 84% of them showing an [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=280.92s)]
*  overwhelming victory by Edmundo Gonzalez. Errol? I know we'll all be watching this closely. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=287.16s)]
*  Christian, thank you very much. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVZbKFjit4&t=293.32s)]
