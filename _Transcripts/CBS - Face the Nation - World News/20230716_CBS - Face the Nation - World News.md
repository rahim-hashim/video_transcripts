# Jake Sullivan says U.S. willing to talk to North Korea "without preconditions" about nuclear arms
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng)
*  We turn now to President Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=0.0s)]
*  who we spoke with earlier about the latest Chinese cyber hack. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=4.16s)]
*  This was an intrusion actually into Microsoft, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=7.68s)]
*  into Microsoft's cloud system. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=10.16s)]
*  They went in through that to get into [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=12.24s)]
*  the unclassified email system of US government agencies. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=15.08s)]
*  It was actually the US government that discovered the intrusion, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=18.36s)]
*  alerted Microsoft, shut it down. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=20.88s)]
*  We're taking steps to make sure that that's not a vulnerability going forward. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=22.8s)]
*  We have seen this kind of thing before, many times over many administrations, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=27.34s)]
*  and we take steps to try to hold the relevant actors responsible, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=31.7s)]
*  and we'll do so in this case. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=35.14s)]
*  They're China-based actors, according to Microsoft. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=36.62s)]
*  Do you have any reason to dispute that? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=39.9s)]
*  No, I have no reason to dispute what Microsoft is saying. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=41.62s)]
*  The Treasury secretary told us that China's decision to cut off [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=44.42s)]
*  ingredients for computer chips starting August 1st may be retaliatory [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=47.54s)]
*  for some of the actions the US has taken to restrict tech sales to China. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=51.9s)]
*  Do you see this as tit for tat moves here? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=56.14s)]
*  Are we in a period of escalation despite your diplomatic outreach? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=58.86s)]
*  Look, I can't get inside the heads of the Chinese decision-makers, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=63.86s)]
*  so I'm not sure what was motivating them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=67.42s)]
*  What I do know is that I think it's a self-defeating move [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=69.18s)]
*  because I believe that it will only reinforce [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=71.94s)]
*  the determination of many other countries in the world to de-risk, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=75.9s)]
*  to find ways to reduce dependencies and increase the resilience of their own supply chains, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=79.06s)]
*  including for the kinds of critical minerals that are at issue in this particular decision. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=83.94000000000001s)]
*  So from our perspective, we are being clear and transparent about the steps we're taking. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=89.06s)]
*  We're not looking to end all trade with China. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=93.38000000000001s)]
*  What we're looking to do is have a small yard of restrictions on technology [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=96.06s)]
*  with national security implications and a high fence around that yard. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=101.26s)]
*  That's what we're going to continue to do. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=104.86000000000001s)]
*  And China, of course, will have to make its own decisions. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=106.78s)]
*  Staying in Asia, we saw this week that North Korea appears to have taken a significant step [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=109.82000000000001s)]
*  towards an intercontinental ballistic missile that could put the U.S. within range [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=115.38s)]
*  of a nuclear weapon, potentially. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  Are you concerned that they will carry out another nuclear test in the coming weeks? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=123.18s)]
*  I have been concerned for some time that North Korea would conduct [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=129.86s)]
*  what would be its seventh nuclear test, going back multiple administrations. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=133.86s)]
*  And I remain concerned about that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=138.54s)]
*  I don't see any immediate indications that that's going to happen, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=139.78s)]
*  but it would not come as a surprise if North Korea moved forward with another nuclear test. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=143.14s)]
*  With respect to its intercontinental ballistic missile capability, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=147.82s)]
*  this is a capability they began testing several years ago. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=151.26s)]
*  They have continued to test it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=155.14s)]
*  We watch all of those tests very closely to see how it is developing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=156.5s)]
*  And we coordinate extremely closely with our allies, with Japan and Korea, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=160.38s)]
*  to make sure that we are responding in lockstep to this threat. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=165.26s)]
*  Have you made any new diplomatic overtures since this test in order to negotiate with Pyongyang [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=168.54s)]
*  or talk to them at all? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=174.06s)]
*  Not since this test, but over the course of the Biden administration, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=175.46s)]
*  we have indicated to North Korea that we're prepared to sit down and talk [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=178.9s)]
*  without preconditions about their nuclear program. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=182.46s)]
*  And we've also made clear to China that it is the United States who is ready for diplomacy [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=185.62s)]
*  and North Korea who is not. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=190.1s)]
*  So from our perspective, China has a role to play here, too, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=191.38s)]
*  given its relationship with North Korea, to indicate to the North Koreans that its continued testing [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=194.98s)]
*  is destabilizing and frankly is, in fact, only creating circumstances [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=201.26s)]
*  in which the United States, our allies and partners have to step up our activities [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=207.54s)]
*  and posture to respond to the threat. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=211.82s)]
*  You are just back from Europe where the president was at this NATO summit. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=213.9s)]
*  On the diplomatic front, though, there are other issues as well, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  including the expiration of what's known as this Black Sea Initiative [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=221.94s)]
*  to allow for ships carrying food leaving Ukraine to safely pass without Russia attacking them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=227.29999999999998s)]
*  Is there any sign from Vladimir Putin that he is willing to extend this? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=234.18s)]
*  Look, I can't predict what Vladimir Putin will do. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=239.26s)]
*  He has been all over the map with respect to this initiative over the course of the past many months. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=241.5s)]
*  It is possible that Russia pulls out of it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=246.94s)]
*  It is possible they continue. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=248.86s)]
*  If, in fact, they pull out of it, the rest of the world will take a look at that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=250.42000000000002s)]
*  and say that Russia has turned its back on ensuring that the countries of the global South [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=254.5s)]
*  and Africa and Latin America and Asia can get the food they need at affordable prices. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=259.98s)]
*  And I think that will come at an enormous diplomatic cost to Russia going forward. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=265.94s)]
*  So this is a choice Vladimir Putin is going to have to make. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=269.9s)]
*  We are prepared for any scenario and we're working closely with the Ukrainians on that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=272.74s)]
*  OK, because it's set to expire at midnight tomorrow. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=276.62s)]
*  In terms of the promises made at NATO, there was this general pledge to potentially allow Ukraine to join in the future. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=280.42s)]
*  Are you concerned that that will shape a negotiation potentially with Russia to end the conflict [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=288.94s)]
*  where they are incentivized to just drag this out? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=294.42s)]
*  The Ukrainians are currently, as we speak, bravely and courageously pushing against the Russian lines in the South and in the East. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=298.5s)]
*  They are inflicting enormous damage on the Russian forces. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=306.22s)]
*  The West is working to continue to tighten the squeeze of our sanctions, hollowing out Russia's defense industrial base, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=309.62s)]
*  weakening its capacity to produce advanced technology. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=317.14s)]
*  We will continue to put economic pressure on Russia and the Ukrainians will continue to put military pressure on Russia. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=320.5s)]
*  So I think in the end, if Russia chooses to continue fighting in this war, it will come at a grave cost to Russia [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=328.14s)]
*  and Ukraine will continue to make progress on the battlefield. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=334.7s)]
*  In the meantime, we are going to make sure that Ukraine has the support it needs for as long as it takes. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=337.78s)]
*  And that is a message that came out of the NATO summit. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=343.34s)]
*  And finally, yes, we said at NATO, very simply, Ukraine's future is in NATO. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=346.14s)]
*  We meant it. That's not up for negotiation. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=351.26s)]
*  That's something that now all 31 allies have committed to. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  Not up for negotiation. OK. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=356.41999999999996s)]
*  On Iran, before I let you go, you've said that the administration is trying to put Iran's nuclear program back in the box, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=358.98s)]
*  ultimately through some diplomatic effort. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=367.3s)]
*  Are you close to any type of understanding on that front and any type of understanding that would allow for the four Americans to be released? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=370.26s)]
*  We have tried very hard to secure the release of the four unjustly detained Americans in Iran. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=379.14s)]
*  We have done so since the day that President Biden took office. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=385.46000000000004s)]
*  We have had indirect contacts with Iran on this in an effort to try to get a deal that could get them released. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=389.14000000000004s)]
*  We have not arrived at an understanding that would get them out at this point. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=395.58000000000004s)]
*  We are continuing to work at it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=399.26s)]
*  And by understanding in terms of the nuclear program, this would not be any kind of written agreement. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=400.86s)]
*  We are not close to any kind of actual deal. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=406.26s)]
*  With respect to the nuclear program, we're not close to any kind of a deal. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=408.90000000000003s)]
*  May I quickly ask you about Rob Malley, the president's envoy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=412.14s)]
*  Is he coming back to the administration? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=415.9s)]
*  We understand he's being suspended as the security clearance is being reviewed. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=417.97999999999996s)]
*  Rob Malley has served multiple administrations faithfully and well. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=421.82s)]
*  He is a public servant. He is a diplomat. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=425.78s)]
*  He is engaged in high level, high stakes diplomacy for a long time. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=428.14s)]
*  And he's someone who a lot of us, including myself, have deep respect for. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=432.82s)]
*  I can't speak to the current circumstances. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=436.34s)]
*  I have to refer you to the State Department on that. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=438.5s)]
*  All right. Jake Sullivan, thank you for joining us today. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ptpGUw2Ng&t=441.06s)]
