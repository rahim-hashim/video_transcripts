# World leaders react to Trump saying he wants to acquire the Panama Canal, Canada and Greenland
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE)
*  All right to politics now and President-elect Donald Trump, who spent the Christmas holiday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=0.0s)]
*  laying out foreign policy aspirations for a second term, including his threat to retake [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  control of the Panama Canal. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=9.6s)]
*  He explains some of the reasoning behind that in this extensive Christmas Day post on Truth [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=12.0s)]
*  Social. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=17.48s)]
*  Trump also suggested making Canada the 51st state and acquiring Greenland for national [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=18.48s)]
*  security purposes. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  The U.S. built the Panama Canal in the early 1900s but agreed to transfer ownership to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=25.2s)]
*  Panama during the Carter administration. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=30.18s)]
*  The Central American country officially took control of the canal in 1999. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=32.74s)]
*  And CBS News political reporter Torian Smalls has been following this and joins us now with [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=37.92s)]
*  more on those stories. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  Torian, why is President-elect Trump pushing for the Panama Canal and how is Panama responding [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=43.16s)]
*  to all this? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=48.84s)]
*  Yes, Chanel, as President Trump mentioned in social media posts, he bemoaned the idea [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=50.84s)]
*  that the United States has spent money and manpower on constructing and also repairs [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  for the canal just to see the same price increases through utilizing it as any other nation. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  He thinks that if the United States regains control over it, it can also utilize that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=66.76s)]
*  crucial resource to help with U.S. trade relations. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  Though as we've seen from the Panamanian government, they have no interest in selling it back to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  the United States. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=80.88000000000001s)]
*  In order for that to happen, of course, without the means of forcible annexation, the United [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  States will have to go through another bilateral treaty, one like we saw happen under the Carter [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  administration like you mentioned there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  It's unlikely that Panama is willing to come to the table for that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=99.04s)]
*  So this is more of the president speaking for hopeful, wishless for his administration, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=102.5s)]
*  but unlikely to happen during his term in office. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=109.62s)]
*  Torian, we know Trump also made some similar statements about acquiring Greenland and Canada. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=112.22s)]
*  What would that really accomplish and how are some of these other nations reacting to this? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=117.3s)]
*  Well, Chanel, let's start with Canada. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=123.9s)]
*  The president has had a long rivalry with the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=125.7s)]
*  He came to Mar-a-Lago shortly after Donald Trump clinched the election in November and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=133.8s)]
*  had what he called good conversations with him about moving forward with U.S.-Canada-Canadian [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=139.28s)]
*  relations. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=144.3s)]
*  The issue, though, appears to be that that icy relationship hasn't thawed since, and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=145.3s)]
*  we've seen Trump since that meeting go to social media to troll him. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=149.78s)]
*  He said that NHL hockey legend Wayne Gretzky should take over as the next prime minister [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=154.66s)]
*  of Canada. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=162.62s)]
*  On the issue of annexing Canada, although it's unlikely to happen, he's saying it should [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=165.26s)]
*  be the 51st state because he believes it would be a net positive for the Canadian people. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=168.98s)]
*  As it relates to Greenland, the U.S. has long before flirted with the idea of purchasing [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=175.78s)]
*  it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=180.78s)]
*  The island's prime minister also said Greenland at this point is just not for sale. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=182.78s)]
*  OK, another thread we're following, Torian Trump saying this week as well that he would [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=188.02s)]
*  instruct the Justice Department to pursue the death penalty. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=196.46s)]
*  Well, I want to start with the number 13. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=199.46s)]
*  That's the number of executions that happened under Donald Trump in my lifetime. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=201.78s)]
*  There's only been three other executions that happened all under George W. Bush. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=206.18s)]
*  So this is a promise that he's looking to continue or a precedent that he's looking [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=212.38s)]
*  to continue in his second administration, making himself the most killing president, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=216.46s)]
*  to put it lightly. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=223.38s)]
*  But what we're seeing here is his promise of being tough on crime. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=224.58s)]
*  He and his supporters believe that there is a connection between capital punishment and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=228.9s)]
*  a crackdown on criminal activity. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=233.9s)]
*  He also is looking to draw daylight between himself and Joe Biden. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=237.74s)]
*  Joe Biden, as we know, just recently commuted several death penalty inmates, knocked it [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=240.74s)]
*  down to life in prison without parole. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=249.26s)]
*  That's something that Donald Trump has condemned. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=251.78s)]
*  And like you said, said that he'll be instructing his DOJ to be much tougher on crime than [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=253.82s)]
*  Joe Biden, Chanel. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=258.7s)]
*  All right, Torian Small, thank you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v32-zh9wCIE&t=259.7s)]
