# How the U.S., other world leaders are responding to Maduroâ€™s inauguration
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM)
*  Out of some other big headlines, Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro has been sworn in for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=0.0s)]
*  a third term as president despite widespread doubts over the legitimacy of the country's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=5.04s)]
*  election results. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Many world leaders, including President Biden, are refusing to recognize Maduro as the country's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=11.72s)]
*  duly elected president. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=16.46s)]
*  And this isn't the first time Maduro has come under international scrutiny. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=18.06s)]
*  The U.S. and other nations also condemned his 2018 reelection as illegitimate. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=21.28s)]
*  Meantime we're also monitoring the situation in Sudan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=27.96s)]
*  This week, the U.S. determined the Sudanese rebel group RSF has committed genocide amid [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=30.76s)]
*  the ongoing civil war there. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=36.44s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd joins us now for what is a regular [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=39.28s)]
*  weekly national security wrap. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Sam, great to have you on the program. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=46.0s)]
*  Let's begin with what's happening in Venezuela. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  What kind of responses are we seeing from the U.S. and others to Maduro's inauguration? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, Maduro was sworn in on Friday for another six-year term. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=55.88s)]
*  And the U.S. responded quite significantly also on Friday with a set of punitive measures [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=59.92s)]
*  against Maduro and his cronies. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=65.04s)]
*  For starters, the United States increased the reward against Maduro and some of his [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=67.8s)]
*  senior officials for narcotics trafficking and other illicit activities. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=72.48s)]
*  In addition to that, the United States Treasury Department rolled out sanctions against eight [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=76.54s)]
*  individuals in the security and economic sectors for their role in supporting Maduro's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=82.82s)]
*  quote illegitimate claim to power. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=88.3s)]
*  At the same time, additional visa restrictions were rolled out against individuals accused [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=91.74s)]
*  of undermining the electoral process in Venezuela. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=96.58s)]
*  On the flip side, this past week, the United States also announced, the Biden administration [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=100.3s)]
*  announced that they were extending what is known as temporary protected status for over [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=105.46s)]
*  600,000 Venezuelans who've been in the country since July of 2023. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=110.74s)]
*  We should likely expect increased punitive measures against the Maduro regime, as well [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=116.61999999999999s)]
*  by the Trump administration, who has condemned a lot of the activities that Maduro has implemented [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=121.02s)]
*  against his people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=125.94s)]
*  So that's one major issue happening in South America. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  Let's turn now to the African continent and Sudan. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=131.66s)]
*  The genocide the U.S. has acknowledged is taking place there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=134.57999999999998s)]
*  What are the allegations the U.S. is making against the Rapid Support Forces or RSF? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=137.82s)]
*  And what can you tell us about the humanitarian situation as it unfolds? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=142.78s)]
*  Well, let's start with the context. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=146.06s)]
*  Sudan has been locked in a brutal civil war since April of 2023, pitting the Sudanese [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=148.94s)]
*  military against a paramilitary force known as the Rapid Support Forces or the RSF. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=153.98s)]
*  This civil war has had devastating consequences. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=159.66s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people have been killed, 11 million people forced to flee their homes [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=162.06s)]
*  and 30 million people, this is all according to the U.N., in need of humanitarian assistance, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=167.26s)]
*  including hundreds of thousands facing famine. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  Against this really dire backdrop, the United States State Department, after months of deliberation, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=176.89999999999998s)]
*  signed off on a declaration of genocide perpetuated by the RSF. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=182.89999999999998s)]
*  They also sanctioned the leader of the RSF for his activities. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=188.2s)]
*  The U.S. and the United Arab Emirates, who has been supplying supplies and weapons to the RSF for several months now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=192.18s)]
*  That's a very significant note. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=218.38s)]
*  There are other things viewers should be aware of, considering our attention has been elsewhere this week. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=221.38s)]
*  Sam Vinograd, thank you so much for that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=226.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2c8s3jN1iM&t=228.5s)]
