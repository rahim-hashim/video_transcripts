# The “central issue” for Netanyahu and Trump is Iranian nuclear weapons, John Bolton says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=0.0s)]
*  As mentioned a moment ago, Israel's cabinet is set to meet tomorrow to vote on the ceasefire [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=2.96s)]
*  and hostage release deal negotiated by the Israelis, Hamas, lots of other partners, outgoing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=7.54s)]
*  by administration, the incoming Trump administration. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=13.46s)]
*  This vote was delayed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who cited a quote, last minute [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=16.22s)]
*  crisis, unquote, with Hamas. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=20.8s)]
*  Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and one of four national security advisors [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=24.64s)]
*  to the first Trump administration, John Bolton joins us now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=29.0s)]
*  John, it's always great to see you evaluate the limbo status of the ceasefire between [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  Israel and Hamas hung up in the Knesset. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=38.24s)]
*  Do you expect the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to resolve this in time to implement [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=41.88s)]
*  phase one? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  I think the odds are that the phase one ceasefire will go ahead, largely because, at least [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=48.16s)]
*  according to my understanding, Donald Trump has put enormous pressure on Netanyahu to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=55.36s)]
*  agree to terms that otherwise Netanyahu might not have considered in order for Trump to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=62.0s)]
*  be able to declare that it was his involvement that brought the deal to fruition after these [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=68.64s)]
*  many months of negotiation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=74.12s)]
*  So I think unless the obstacles are more difficult than they appear, I would bet at the moment [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=75.8s)]
*  that the deal would go ahead. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=81.44s)]
*  It is a multi-phased deal, as you well know, John. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=84.0s)]
*  That means the Trump administration, President Trump, is going to have to continue to lean [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=86.9s)]
*  on the Netanyahu administration to implement the other parts of it, which require some [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=90.24s)]
*  tactical and strategic decisions for the Israeli military as it relates to Gaza that some in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=95.66s)]
*  the Netanyahu cabinet, to put it mildly, disagree with. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=105.6s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure that Netanyahu himself necessarily is going to be agreeing to more [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=106.6s)]
*  than phase one. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=111.06s)]
*  The hostage is out, I think, is the centerpiece of what Trump's attention is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=112.96s)]
*  The other phases, which contemplate moving toward the end of the war, I think Trump is [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=117.96s)]
*  more likely to give Israel some leeway. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=123.6s)]
*  And I think the real issue, the central issue for Netanyahu and perhaps for Trump as well, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=126.16s)]
*  is not Gaza. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=132.48s)]
*  It's what Israel may or may not do to the Iranian nuclear weapons program. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=133.48s)]
*  So I think from the Israeli government's perspective, making an accommodation with [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=138.3s)]
*  Trump on this ceasefire hostage release matter is important to give them the flexibility [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=142.82000000000002s)]
*  that Israel may want to go after the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=150.02s)]
*  John, let's drill down on that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  What do you mean by flexibility? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  There are those in the region who say Iran is on the run. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=157.82000000000002s)]
*  It has lost its proxy status through Hamas in Gaza. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  It has lost its proxy status through Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=164.62s)]
*  The Houthis are not as powerful or not as harassing as they were five or six months [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=168.82s)]
*  ago. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=173.38s)]
*  And if Iran is on the run, is this now time for Israel to do what it's always wanted to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=174.38s)]
*  do, which is bring a finality to Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, even if that means kinetic [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=178.62s)]
*  warfare? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=184.1s)]
*  I can't think of a better time for Israel. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  The very fact is, as you say, is that Iran is in the worst position it's been in probably [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=188.3s)]
*  since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=193.78s)]
*  So if Israel really wants to go after the nuclear program, this is the time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  Moreover, I think that it would add to what is already going on inside Iran. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=201.5s)]
*  The regime is very unpopular, has been for many years because of economic conditions [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=207.06s)]
*  after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=213.7s)]
*  And as you say, the severe damage done to the terrorist proxies, people in Iran at the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=216.14s)]
*  highest levels, but really across the country are engaged in a lot of finger pointing and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=221.14s)]
*  recrimination. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=225.57999999999998s)]
*  All this money, all these resources devoted to these external activities, not for the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  people of Iran. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=231.89999999999998s)]
*  I think the regime is in deep trouble. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=232.89999999999998s)]
*  And I don't think, honestly, there can possibly be sustained security and peace in the region [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=234.54s)]
*  until that regime goes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=241.5s)]
*  I think that's on Israel's mind too. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=242.94s)]
*  Do you think incoming Trump wants to upend the Iranian regime as we know it? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=245.66s)]
*  Well, he said immediately after the election that regime change was not his goal. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=252.06s)]
*  But the end of the nuclear program was certainly the reason we reimposed sanctions after getting [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  out of the 2015 nuclear deal. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=263.42s)]
*  And I think the only long term answer here, as I say, is replace that regime in Tehran. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=266.06s)]
*  It may be out of our control in any event. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=273.7s)]
*  I do think the people of Iran are largely against the regime. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=275.98s)]
*  If the supreme leader were to die and he's 85 years old and not well, they've only had [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=280.5s)]
*  two supreme leaders, there's no clear path to a successor. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=285.72s)]
*  That the circumstances are such that what looks like a very imposing regime on the outside [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=290.06s)]
*  really could collapse very quickly, not unlike what happened to Assad in Syria. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=295.42s)]
*  One more question on Iran, John, because I know you think and have thought a lot about it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=300.94s)]
*  It's pretty clear the Israeli military, if it had kinetic warfare goals to eliminate [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  the Iran nuclear program, would need help from the United States, would need air assets [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=309.86s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=314.54s)]
*  That means President Trump would have to agree to partner with Israel on this particular [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=315.54s)]
*  endeavor. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=320.42s)]
*  Could that happen in the first year of the second Trump administration? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=321.82s)]
*  And what effect would that have in the region? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=324.82s)]
*  Well, I think it's unlikely Trump would have the U.S. participate directly. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=327.62s)]
*  I would argue for that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=331.34s)]
*  I don't think that's what Trump is going to do. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=333.42s)]
*  But I think that Israel's capabilities really are pretty extensive. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=335.38s)]
*  And while there are some targets that they couldn't finish off the way we could, they [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=339.62s)]
*  could do substantial damage, closing, for example, at the Forto enrichment site, which [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=344.98s)]
*  is deeply buried in a mountain, closing the entrance shafts and the air shafts, which [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=350.7s)]
*  would preclude enriching uranium. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=355.26s)]
*  It's not it's not a perfect answer, but I think Iran's air defenses have now been [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=358.26s)]
*  reduced really to fairly primitive devices. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=364.62s)]
*  I think Israel would have freedom in the skies. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  And I think, as I say, this is they're not going to get a better opportunity. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=371.06s)]
*  Mike Turner is not a household name in our country, John, but you know him. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=375.94s)]
*  He is the outgoing now chair of the House Intelligence Committee, replaced by Speaker [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=379.9s)]
*  Mike Johnson. Do you think there is anything worrisome about that development? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=384.62s)]
*  I think it's very worrisome. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=390.18s)]
*  We don't know the exact circumstances, but Turner was a supporter of assistance to Ukraine. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=391.86s)]
*  He spoke out against Trump's conduct during the classified documents investigation, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=396.86s)]
*  what it meant for any former official, including the former president, to take these masses [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=403.7s)]
*  of classified documents and then refuse to give them back. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=409.14s)]
*  And so I think that criticism has stung Trump. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=413.1s)]
*  I think it's entirely possible he asked Speaker Mike Johnson to remove Mike Turner. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=416.74s)]
*  And I'm sad to say, after what I think had been a pretty good performance as Speaker [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=421.58s)]
*  by Mike Johnson, under very difficult circumstances, to bend the knee to Trump on this [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=425.42s)]
*  is a big mistake. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=430.82s)]
*  Related to that, Tulsi Gabbard has been nominated by the president-elect to be the director [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=432.94s)]
*  of national intelligence. Your level of concern about that nomination? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=437.06s)]
*  I think Tulsi Gabbard is dangerous. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=441.78s)]
*  I think others of people Trump has nominated may be lacking in competence. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=443.85999999999996s)]
*  But I think the trio of Matt Gaetz, who, of course, is now no longer in the running for [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=448.97999999999996s)]
*  attorney general, Matt Gaetz, Tulsi Gabbard and Cash Patel, are a trio that really are [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=454.05999999999995s)]
*  dangerous to American national security and law enforcement. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=459.65999999999997s)]
*  And this is very serious. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=462.82s)]
*  I think if Gabbard were confirmed, other nations would be reluctant to share sensitive [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=465.5s)]
*  information with somebody who's shown such poor judgment. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=470.14s)]
*  And I hope I hope that's taken very seriously, particularly by Republicans. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=474.94s)]
*  This is this is something that that really has nothing to do with Donald Trump. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=479.26s)]
*  This has to do with the integrity and security of the enormous intelligence network [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=484.3s)]
*  we have, which is critical for the security of our country. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=490.62s)]
*  John, there is a tick tock ban that is set to take effect by federal law January 19th. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=494.41999999999996s)]
*  President-elect Trump has been all over the map on this. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=500.97999999999996s)]
*  There is some suggestion he might use an executive order to delay implementation of the federal [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=503.65999999999997s)]
*  law banning tick tock as a social media platform in this country. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=508.21999999999997s)]
*  Where do you think that should end up? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=512.46s)]
*  Well, I've heard the same reports. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=515.14s)]
*  I don't know that he would have the authority to do that, but that wouldn't necessarily [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=517.14s)]
*  restrain him. I think the main problem with tick tock has nothing to do with what appears on [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzBUNW-ubs&t=521.54s)]
