# Robert Gates says NATO expansion "changes the geopolitics of Europe in a dramatic way"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [May 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo)
*  Last week, President Biden welcomed the heads of Finland and Sweden to the White House in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=0.0s)]
*  honor of both countries' declaration to join NATO. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=5.36s)]
*  Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates tells us why this move will have such an enormous [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=8.84s)]
*  impact on Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Western Military Alliance. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=13.14s)]
*  I think it's huge, Margaret. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=19.12s)]
*  I think it changes the geopolitics in Europe in a dramatic way. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=20.76s)]
*  Now he's got NATO on his doorstep, not only in Ukraine and elsewhere. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=26.54s)]
*  He's going to have them on his border in Finland. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=32.54s)]
*  And it's an amazing thing he's done because he's gotten Sweden to abandon 200 years of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=35.66s)]
*  neutrality. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  So I think Putin, one of his many huge miscalculations in invading Ukraine is he has dramatically [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  changed the geostrategic posture of Western Europe. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=54.0s)]
*  And now that you have the Swedes and the Finns as part of that, he's really put Russia in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=58.02s)]
*  a much worse strategic position than it had before the invasion. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=64.1s)]
*  But he could still win. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=68.54s)]
*  Vladimir Putin could still win in Ukraine? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=69.66s)]
*  If winning means taking over the country and absorbing it into Russia, the whole country, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=72.32s)]
*  I think that's very unlikely at this point. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=79.22s)]
*  He has the potential to hold on to a good part of the Donbass. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=82.42s)]
*  But I think in terms of pushing on to Odessa or trying to bring a change of government [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=89.48s)]
*  in Kiev or absorb Ukraine, I think if that's winning, I don't see that he can win. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=94.5s)]
*  What are the security guarantees that the West needs to put in Zelensky's hands, to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=102.26s)]
*  put in Ukraine's hands to actually broker a deal? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=107.54s)]
*  I think access to Western weapons, continued training by NATO countries, including the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=111.08s)]
*  United States, a promise to keep a large NATO presence in Eastern Europe next door to Ukraine, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=121.12s)]
*  the supply lines. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=132.36s)]
*  The other thing that I think is really going to be critically important, especially if [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=133.36s)]
*  this conflict drags on for a very long time, is the West has to come together and figure [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=137.46s)]
*  out some way to help Ukraine economically, long-term, both short-term humanitarian needs, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=144.3s)]
*  but then rebuilding. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=150.46s)]
*  Do you have a concern that if Putin is cornered, that he would actually use a tactical nuke? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=151.68s)]
*  I think the probability of him using a tactical nuclear weapon is low, but not zero. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=157.9s)]
*  There are no large masses of Ukrainian forces that would be taken out by a tactical nuclear [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=164.22s)]
*  weapon. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=170.76s)]
*  If it's not got a military purpose, then the only purpose is as a terror weapon to try [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=171.76s)]
*  and break the will of the Ukrainian people. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=177.56s)]
*  I think that moment has come and gone. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=179.68s)]
*  I don't think that there's anything at this point that will break the will of the Ukrainian [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=182.44s)]
*  people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=187.0s)]
*  The other thing that I hope somebody around Putin is reminding him is that in that part [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=188.32s)]
*  of the world, and particularly in eastern Ukraine, the winds tend to blow from the West. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=193.66s)]
*  If you set off a tactical nuclear weapon in eastern Ukraine, the radiation's going to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=199.33999999999997s)]
*  go into Russia. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=205.33999999999997s)]
*  So, I just hope somebody reminds him of that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=206.33999999999997s)]
*  You've called Vladimir Putin a man of the past, but when I talk to officials now, they [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=209.17999999999998s)]
*  say he could be around for another decade. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=214.5s)]
*  Russia's invasion has weakened Russia, and it's got now long-term economic problems. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=217.5s)]
*  Europe, I think, is very serious at this point about weaning itself away from dependence [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=224.5s)]
*  on Russian oil and gas. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=231.48s)]
*  So, that will weaken Russia significantly. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=232.72s)]
*  Where is he going to find that market around the world? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=235.44s)]
*  China? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=239.52s)]
*  For, China is not going to want to become dependent on Russia for its energy sources. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=240.52s)]
*  China will want to remain diversified. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=245.56s)]
*  They might buy some more Russian oil and gas, but nothing like what would be required to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=247.88s)]
*  replace the European market. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=253.44s)]
*  Putin will remain a pariah. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=256.44s)]
*  It's hard to see Putin ever walking in the door of the White House or number 10 Downing [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=257.72s)]
*  Street or at the Elysee. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=262.04s)]
*  So, I think Russia, he has put Russia really behind the eight ball, economically, militarily, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=264.24s)]
*  and because now people are going to look at the Russian military and say, you know, this [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=275.48s)]
*  was supposed to be this fantastic military. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=280.48s)]
*  Well, they give a good parade, but in actual combat, not so hot. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=282.64s)]
*  Xi Jinping is watching what's happening in Ukraine, and he is taking notes. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=287.88s)]
*  What do you think his lesson is so far? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=292.44s)]
*  He and Putin have had a common narrative about the decline of the West. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=294.52s)]
*  We're paralyzed. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=301.82s)]
*  We're polarized. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=302.82s)]
*  We can't get anything done. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=304.04s)]
*  The alliance was divided and had lost its purpose and so on. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=305.28s)]
*  Boom. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=310.2s)]
*  We totally underestimated the West. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=311.3s)]
*  We underestimated the United States' willingness to take the lead again. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=313.56s)]
*  We underestimated the willingness of the Europeans to come together and of the United States [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=318.38s)]
*  to put this coalition together, and we underestimated how fast and how severe the sanctions are [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=323.16s)]
*  that they could place. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=329.88s)]
*  So maybe the West isn't as weak as we thought. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=332.28s)]
*  Second lesson is, looking at the Russian military performance, he's got to ask himself, what [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  if my equipment isn't any better than the Russians? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=341.76s)]
*  What if my troops aren't any better than the Russians? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=344.34s)]
*  Maybe my military is not as good as they're telling me they are. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  The Chinese have given the Russians all kinds of rhetorical and political support, but they [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=350.32s)]
*  are doing very little concretely to help the Russians. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=356.32s)]
*  My guess is, Putin told Xi before the Olympics, look, I'm going to do this. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=360.84s)]
*  It's going to take a few days, and it'll be done. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=366.44s)]
*  I'd wager that Xi never expected a protracted, brutal conflict that would isolate Russia [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  so much from the rest of the world. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=378.84s)]
*  So I think he's playing it actually very cautiously. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=382.67999999999995s)]
*  Is the rise of China still inevitable? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=385.65999999999997s)]
*  China and its role as a, its growing role as a global power will continue. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=389.12s)]
*  They do have some real problems. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  The big issue for Xi, where he can't admit he's wrong, is on the zero COVID. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=398.0s)]
*  And when you shut down a city of 25 million people for weeks, and people don't have food, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=406.08000000000004s)]
*  they don't have water, they don't have medical care, this has consequences. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=411.68s)]
*  But how can he say, I got that wrong, when it's resulted in so much economic and human cost? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=417.2s)]
*  You were directly involved in overseeing the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan for so long. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=427.2s)]
*  The Taliban's back in power in Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda is in the government. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=433.88s)]
*  Women on the street have to cover their faces and their bodies now. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=439.55999999999995s)]
*  And when you say people don't have widespread access to education, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=444.8s)]
*  how do you make sense of where we are now? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=448.8s)]
*  Well, I think people predicted every single one of those things would happen. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=454.08s)]
*  If we got out of Afghanistan altogether, I think we made a mistake in pulling everybody out. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=458.0s)]
*  I think that had we kept a small number of US troops, 5,000, 6,000, something on that order, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=464.4s)]
*  the equipment would have been repaired and taken care of. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=473.0s)]
*  I mean, we built a military modeled on our own, which requires a lot of logistical support, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  a lot of sophisticated maintenance and so on. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=484.16s)]
*  How was that not known after 20 years of war? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  How was that dependence not recognized? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=492.04s)]
*  I think people did recognize it, and that's one of the reasons that people in the military argued [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=494.8s)]
*  for keeping a number of people there, because only if we had some representation in our military [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=500.04s)]
*  would the contractors who take care of those things been willing to stay. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=507.08000000000004s)]
*  So they weren't at risk. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=511.32s)]
*  And when you had military, Afghan military, suddenly realizing they're getting no ammunition, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=512.48s)]
*  they're getting no food, they're getting no support, and they're isolated, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=519.72s)]
*  it's kind of no wonder that most of them gave up. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=523.36s)]
*  It wasn't that they were cowardly or that they were unwilling to fight. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=526.28s)]
*  It was they had poor leadership, and they had this dependency on technical support that went away. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=532.12s)]
*  You must have seen the Special Inspector General report that came out just a few days ago. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=542.44s)]
*  It blamed both President Trump and President Biden for withdrawing the military and contractors. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=547.76s)]
*  Don't forget it started under President Obama, so you have three presidents. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=554.8s)]
*  You would add culpability there. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=559.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=561.24s)]
*  They all wanted out of Afghanistan, the forever war. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=564.36s)]
*  But that allows for no shades of gray. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=568.68s)]
*  It's either all in or all out is the way it was portrayed. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=572.72s)]
*  And in fact, there were alternatives, and the military put forward some of those alternatives, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=576.76s)]
*  which was a relatively small number of people that we would plan to keep there for some indefinite period. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=582.32s)]
*  You've admitted your own error there in that model of replicating an American-type military style [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  and trying to rebuild it within the Afghan forces. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=597.6s)]
*  I mean, it was well along that way when I got there, but I certainly didn't do anything to change it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=600.44s)]
*  You said before the biggest threat to the United States is our polarization and the distance, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=605.5600000000001s)]
*  the two square miles that encompass the White House and the Capitol building. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=610.84s)]
*  Do you still feel that way? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=614.76s)]
*  Totally. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=616.36s)]
*  You don't see signs of improvement? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=617.84s)]
*  No, I will say this. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=620.44s)]
*  There is one glimmer of hope that I see, and it's in kind of my world. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=624.72s)]
*  Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have done something no other living human beings have done. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=630.84s)]
*  They've actually brought Republicans and Democrats together on Capitol Hill and with the administration. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=635.7199999999999s)]
*  You know, apart from a handful of isolationist Republican senators, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=640.88s)]
*  you've got pretty from left to right a pretty strong consensus in Washington. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=644.64s)]
*  But I would say it's broader than just Ukraine. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=651.4s)]
*  You have the same kind of attitudes toward China and how we react to China and to Russia more broadly beyond Ukraine. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=653.2399999999999s)]
*  So maybe that's a foundation. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=661.28s)]
*  Maybe there's a way to build on that. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=664.76s)]
*  And who knows if you begin to get it in national security policy, maybe you can get it in some other places. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=667.32s)]
*  I'll take the optimism. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=673.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure I'd take the bet, but you might take the optimism. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1O4A_gqWo&t=675.64s)]
