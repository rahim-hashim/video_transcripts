# Israeli ambassador Michael Herzog says "we have to destroy the Hamas' war machine"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ)
*  joined now by the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Herzog. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, first, I want to offer you our condolences. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=4.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=9.4s)]
*  We know that your prime minister is promising a sustained campaign. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=12.68s)]
*  Do you have any sense of how Israel will define success? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=16.8s)]
*  Well, Israel is at war. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=22.84s)]
*  Yesterday, we were attacked by a terror organization. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=24.92s)]
*  They infiltrated the Israeli territory and killed hundreds of Israelis. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=29.24s)]
*  At least 600 were butchered yesterday, including whole families, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=35.44s)]
*  elderly women, children. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  Babies were taken out of their mothers' laps and murdered. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=43.44s)]
*  This is war and we have to fight that war and win it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=47.68s)]
*  We have to destroy the Hamas war machine. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  You know, in war, like in war, we have to fight it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=54.12s)]
*  How is it that Hamas managed to take Israeli defense forces by surprise? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=60.04s)]
*  Did they shut down communications? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=65.84s)]
*  Well, it was a surprise attack. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=69.64s)]
*  There was definitely an element of surprise, but I think [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=72.08s)]
*  we'll have enough time to investigate that once we [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=76.44s)]
*  include that war in victory. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=80.88s)]
*  You said you want to destroy the Hamas war machine. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=84.64s)]
*  Hamas is armed and funded by Iran. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=89.28s)]
*  The Biden administration says they don't have evidence that Iran was linked to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=93.4s)]
*  this particular attack. Does Israel have evidence they were? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=97.08s)]
*  Well, we suspect Iranians behind the scenes, as you know, Hamas and Iran are [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=102.52s)]
*  closely tied. Iran provides material support, funding, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=107.84s)]
*  weapons to Hamas. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=112.83999999999999s)]
*  They are tied in what they call the axis of resistance, of course, resistance [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=115.36s)]
*  to the existence of the state of Israel. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=120.44s)]
*  They are part of the same coalition. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=123.24s)]
*  So as far as we are concerned, this is an Iranian led coalition. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=125.72s)]
*  And we suspect that Iran is involved. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=132.12s)]
*  Does that mean Israel will take the fight to Iran? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=136.4s)]
*  I'm not going to say what exactly Israel is going to do, but I would just say [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=139.76s)]
*  that whoever strikes Israel will strike back. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  Sir, this is just stunning to see what has happened in the past few hours. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=150.48s)]
*  But there are questions within Israel, as you know, about how such a strong [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=156.84s)]
*  military was taken by surprise. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=162.48s)]
*  There has been a massive expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank area, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=165.92s)]
*  and with that, a buildup of forces to protect them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=171.04s)]
*  The former ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, has publicly raised the question [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  of whether that's why the border towns over and around Gaza were left [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=180.16s)]
*  unprotected. Were they? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=186.16s)]
*  Was that a factor? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=188.6s)]
*  Well, I don't buy that argument. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=190.8s)]
*  I think that analogy is irrelevant to the current situation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=192.96s)]
*  Yes, it was a surprise attack, but I don't think it has much to do with the fact [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  that the IDF was preoccupied in the West Bank. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=202.12s)]
*  They prepared a surprise attack. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=207.68s)]
*  They breached the border fence. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=210.44s)]
*  They came with paragliders and through the sea. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  And as I said, there will be surprise attacks. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  And as I said, there will be sufficient time after the war to investigate what [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  exactly happened. Right now, we are at war and we have to fight that war and win it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  We were attacked by a terror organization funded by Iran. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  And that's where we are right now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=234.24s)]
*  But you have said that perhaps Hamas miscalculated by looking at all the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  domestic problems Israel has within its own politics right now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  Do you think that that was actually, though, a factor when it comes to military [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=247.72s)]
*  readiness? Did it leave your forces vulnerable? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=253.36s)]
*  They may have maybe they were under the impression that given the internal [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=257.36s)]
*  debate in Israel, that Israel is weakened so that they can provoke us. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=262.56s)]
*  They thought so. I think they're definitely mistaken. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=269.4s)]
*  And you have to know Israelis to understand that when Israel is under [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=273.88s)]
*  attack, Israelis close ranks and they fight together. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=278.48s)]
*  And there's no position coalition right now in Israel. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=282.88s)]
*  There's no debate or reservists are volunteering. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=286.44s)]
*  We are. And this is flooded with phone calls from people who want to go back [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  to Israel and fight Hamas. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  So in that sense, I think it was a gross miscalculation on their part. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  But did it impact readiness? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=304.76s)]
*  Because there were concerns of, you know, your reservists having objections, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=306.84s)]
*  political objections and refusing to serve. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=311.92s)]
*  It did not impact readiness. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=314.28s)]
*  I think Israel is strong. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  As I said, Israelis are closing ranks right now and we will fight back. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=321.12s)]
*  In back in 2006, you had a soldier taking captive and held in Gaza. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=327.36s)]
*  It took over five years to get him back. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=333.24s)]
*  And Israel did so in exchange for a thousand Palestinian prisoners. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=337.48s)]
*  At what cost is Israel prepared to get these new hostages out? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=342.32s)]
*  I think it's premature to discuss that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  And I think we just attacked yesterday. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=351.68s)]
*  Yeah, we understand that there are probably dozens of kidnapped Israelis [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=355.44s)]
*  and others in the hands of Hamas. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=360.88s)]
*  We'll have to deal with it in due time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=364.36s)]
*  The whole issue of hostages is a very sensitive issue. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=368.08s)]
*  I think you know it from your situation in the US. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=372.52s)]
*  And we we have had experience in that in the past. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=375.36s)]
*  It's a very complicated situation. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=378.24s)]
*  But I think it's premature to discuss any deals or prices or whatever. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=380.6s)]
*  Right now, we are at war. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=385.52s)]
*  Are there Americans among those hostages? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=388.12s)]
*  I understand there are, but I don't have details. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  You don't know the numbers or ability to retain them. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=395.56s)]
*  What is it that Israel and your prime minister is asking of the American president right now? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=399.96s)]
*  So there was a very good phone call between President Biden and our prime minister yesterday. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=406.52s)]
*  The US administration [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=411.92s)]
*  sounded a very strong voice of support for Israel [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=414.44s)]
*  from the nation for the terror attack and support for Israel's right to self-defense. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=418.32s)]
*  We are in discussions with the administration about the situation and about our needs. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=423.76s)]
*  I want to take the opportunity to thank the administration [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=430.35999999999996s)]
*  for the solid support of Israel in its rise to self-defense. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=434.35999999999996s)]
*  And before I let you go, how is Israel going to allow some of those [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=439.47999999999996s)]
*  Palestinian civilians who are trapped within Gaza to escape [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=443.32s)]
*  so that they aren't victims of these strikes? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=448.04s)]
*  Well, the fact of the matter is that Hamas uses civilians as human children. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=452.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=457.92s)]
*  Unlike we use our weapons to defend our population, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  they use a population to hide their weapons behind them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=463.08s)]
*  So it's a very unfortunate situation. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=468.12s)]
*  We cannot allow terrorist impunity just because they hide behind civilian population. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=471.47999999999996s)]
*  We give the civilian population due notice and warnings [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=478.2s)]
*  before we strike any military target and we'll continue to do so. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=483.96s)]
*  And to the extent that the population of Gaza is suffering, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=489.68s)]
*  I think the address for this question is Hamas. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=494.24s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you for your time and our condolences once again. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=498.92s)]
*  Thank you very much, Margaret. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhGhotMAyQ&t=503.92s)]
