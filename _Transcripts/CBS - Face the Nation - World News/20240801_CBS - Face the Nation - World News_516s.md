# How the prisoner swap with Russia, U.S. and others came together
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM)
*  Okay, right off the top, our live monitors take us to Houston, Texas, where Vice President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=0.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris will very soon deliver a eulogy today for the late Texas Congresswoman Sheila [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Jackson Lee. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=9.6s)]
*  She will follow the words of the man you see here on the screen in front of me, former [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=11.14s)]
*  President Bill Clinton, who is right now addressing that congregation, paying tribute to that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=15.52s)]
*  former lawmaker in the United States. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=20.96s)]
*  We're going to take you back to Texas shortly, but first we have to get to that breaking [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=22.32s)]
*  The U.S. and Russia completing their biggest prisoner swap in post-Soviet history. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=26.6s)]
*  This is a look right now from Turkey's capital, where that exchange happened. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  This exchange will bring Americans wrongfully detained by the Russian government home after [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  months of negotiations. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=40.52s)]
*  So we know right now three Americans held in Russian prisons are on their way home, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=43.0s)]
*  wheels up as we speak. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=47.56s)]
*  Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovitz, Marine veteran Paul Whalen, and Russian-American [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  radio journalist Alsu Kermasheva. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=54.8s)]
*  We just heard from President Biden touting this success. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=57.12s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=60.04s)]
*  This is an incredible relief for all the families gathered here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=61.04s)]
*  It's relief to the friends and colleagues all across the country who have been praying [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  for this day for a long time. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=70.12s)]
*  The deal that made this possible was the feat of diplomacy and friendship. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=73.08s)]
*  Friendship. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=78.68s)]
*  Multiple countries helped get this done. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=79.68s)]
*  They joined the difficult, complex negotiations at my request. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=82.32s)]
*  And I personally thank them all again. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=86.0s)]
*  And I thank them personally and I thank them again. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  All told, Russia has released 16 prisoners. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  Eight Russians who are being held in the West will be sent home as well. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  These 16 prisoners from Russia have that Russia has released include four Americans, five [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  Germans, seven Russian citizens who are political prisoners in their own country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  So for anyone who questions whether allies matter, they do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=110.92s)]
*  They matter. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  And today is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  Friends you can trust, work with and depend upon. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=121.8s)]
*  President Biden, they're not only saying this is a major success, but punctuating the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=125.64s)]
*  importance of allies. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=129.04s)]
*  And we are in real time tracking a wide range of reactions to this release. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=130.04s)]
*  First of all, Paul Whalen's family, who have been without him for so many months, they [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=135.44s)]
*  released this statement saying, in part, quote, Paul Whalen is free. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=139.28s)]
*  Our family is grateful to the United States government for making Paul's freedom a reality. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=142.56s)]
*  They went on to say, we'd like to thank President Biden, Secretary of State Blinken and National [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  Security Advisor Sullivan for their engagement with the Russian Federation to create the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=151.2s)]
*  environment where Paul's freedom became a possibility. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=155.48s)]
*  We've also heard from The Wall Street Journal where Evan Gershkovitz is a reporter. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=158.64s)]
*  That paper says, in part, quote, Evan and his family have displayed unrivaled courage, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=162.32s)]
*  resilience and poise during this ordeal, which came to an end because of broad advocacy for [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=167.56s)]
*  his release around the world. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  CBS News Senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe joins us live now. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=175.24s)]
*  Ed, you were just in the room with President Biden. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=179.0s)]
*  Yes, this was political, but that announcement also felt personal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=181.08s)]
*  So let's talk about the pieces on the board, so to speak. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  How did this swap come together, Ed? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  It's been in the works for quite a while, Reid, and it involved, as you've reported [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  there, seven different countries and some pretty significant diplomacy by several senior [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=197.76s)]
*  U.S. officials and the vice president speaking with counterparts in Germany, in Russia, in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  Turkey and those Eastern European countries involved in today's swap. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  The president making clear in those White House comments just a little while ago that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=211.92s)]
*  this is a personal and very important issue for him given the element of family, that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=215.72s)]
*  there are families that are still hoping for the return of their loved ones and now, in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=220.76s)]
*  this case, four on their way back to the United States tonight. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=225.24s)]
*  The president also, in those remarks, you'll notice, touted the importance of alliances [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=228.72s)]
*  and of diplomacy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=234.0s)]
*  That is a direct repudiation of the previous administration and former President Donald [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=235.44s)]
*  Trump's attempts to get back to the White House. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=239.52s)]
*  You heard him ask, President Trump has said that he could get Evan Gershkovich back. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=241.72s)]
*  The president said, well, then why didn't he do so when he was president? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=246.16s)]
*  Gershkovich was captured after Trump was out of office, but the point being there are dozens [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=250.12s)]
*  of Americans detained overseas. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=254.96s)]
*  If the previous administration was serious about it, they should have done something [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=256.64s)]
*  about it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  We are expecting that the president will head, as he said in his remarks, to Joint Base Andrews [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  here outside of Washington later today when those families return home to greet them personally. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's also notable that the White House and other U.S. officials have called out two [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=271.64s)]
*  details that speak to the political moment we're in, Reid. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=277.0s)]
*  First of all, that the president himself was making calls on that fateful Sunday afternoon [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=279.6s)]
*  when he announced to the world that he would not be running again for reelection, speaking [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=285.04s)]
*  with a Slovenian counterpart just an hour before that tweet that released a letter telling [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=288.68s)]
*  the world of his intentions. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=294.88s)]
*  The other is that the vice president during recent travels to Europe was in direct talks [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=296.48s)]
*  with the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about some of the details of this to try to compel [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=301.8s)]
*  the German government to consent to this agreement that required releasing a key Russian [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=305.76s)]
*  national from a German prison. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=310.56s)]
*  All of it designed to sort of say, look, for those that had doubts that the president can [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=313.08s)]
*  do the job as president, there he was doing it, even in his hour of greatest political [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=316.8s)]
*  peril. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=321.36s)]
*  And for those of you wondering about the vice president and her utility when it comes to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  foreign affairs, she too was directly involved in these negotiations at key points to get [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=325.88s)]
*  Germany to come along. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=330.46s)]
*  He's also echoed in recent minutes what Secretary of State Blinken has said, which is we are [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=332.24s)]
*  going to vow to continue getting Americans home who are wrongfully detained, not only [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=337.08s)]
*  in Russia but in other countries as well. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=341.36s)]
*  Do you think this will embolden them to be able to continue to push for more Americans [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=343.8s)]
*  to be released? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=348.16s)]
*  Oh, that work continues on a daily basis, Reid. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=349.56s)]
*  There are several Americans known to be detained in countries all over the world. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=354.68s)]
*  There may be cases, frankly, that are not as well publicized as yet. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=358.32s)]
*  But there is an entire office at the State Department that focuses on this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=361.96s)]
*  It's a major priority for the president and his National Security Council. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=364.96s)]
*  And in this case, the CIA was involved because of its relationships with Russian spy agencies. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=369.56s)]
*  So it remains a top-of-mind goal of this president. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=374.48s)]
*  And the kind of action exhibited today, the bold move to get several countries on the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=378.24s)]
*  same page to make this happen is the kind of work, at least in the foreign policy space, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=385.04s)]
*  we should anticipate will continue in the closing months of the president's term, now [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=390.24s)]
*  that he doesn't have to worry about his own political future. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=395.0s)]
*  Remember, he signaled in his remarks that he would be working on big things domestically [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=397.48s)]
*  and in the foreign space. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=401.48s)]
*  This is certainly a good example of that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=403.16s)]
*  And there are several more cases yet to come of detained Americans in Russia and elsewhere. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=404.66s)]
*  Edo, Keith, thank you so much for that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=408.8s)]
*  Also CBS News, intelligence and national security reporter Olivia Gosses live on the stream [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=410.92s)]
*  with us right now. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  You just heard Ed talk about this multinational approach and the foreign space and the political [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  significance of that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  How did this all come together? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=423.04s)]
*  Which nations really stepped forward to work with the Biden administration? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=424.76s)]
*  Sure, Reid. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=428.16s)]
*  Well, the U.S. officials who are intimately involved in these negotiations have described [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=429.96000000000004s)]
*  them as the most complex in U.S. Russian history and even including U.S. Soviet history. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=433.98s)]
*  When as we know, spy swaps hit a crescendo. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=439.68s)]
*  And the reason for that, as you and Ed were discussing, is because of the sheer number [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=442.38s)]
*  of players, countries involved, and also because of the types of prisoners. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=446.21999999999997s)]
*  These are not spies. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=450.64s)]
*  These are political prisoners that Russia is trying to wrangle and extract concessions [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=451.64s)]
*  from other countries from. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=456.96s)]
*  So we've learned since this news broke that half a dozen countries involved, U.S., Russia, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=458.48s)]
*  Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, Turkey, as the site of the swap. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tajdf06VwhM&t=463.76s)]
