# South Korean president faces impeachment calls after martial law miscalculation
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA)
*  All right one day after the chaos of declaring martial law [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=0.0s)]
*  opposition lawmakers in South Korea have submitted a motion to impeach the country's president the designation lasted for about six hours before the president [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  Was forced to reverse it our remain a sencio is following the very latest from Seoul where protesters have been taking to the streets today [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=11.24s)]
*  To call for President Yoon to step down [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=17.8s)]
*  Remy joins me now from the capital in South Korea [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=21.28s)]
*  So Remy you jumped on a plane as soon as we started reporting that the president had declared martial law [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=24.5s)]
*  And what was interesting is in the early hours of that declaration things seemed to be relatively calm by the time [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=31.02s)]
*  You arrived in Seoul. What was the situation like and then what's it like now? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=38.14s)]
*  Yeah, been on the ground here for about six or seven hours anger is [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  The feeling here just in the past couple hours. There was another mass protest from [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=49.3s)]
*  City Hall towards the presidential office [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=55.54s)]
*  The union that organized that said that about ten thousand people [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=57.94s)]
*  Hit the streets against President Yoon Seok-yul. They were calling for him to resign [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=63.26s)]
*  They were calling for him to be arrested. They were calling for him to be impeached [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=69.86s)]
*  So even though the president has said that he will now take back that martial law declaration that really was only in effect for [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=75.4s)]
*  About six hours if he thought that that would quell the anger [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=82.76s)]
*  He has something else coming for him and those are the people here saying that he now [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  Needs to either resign or to be impeached looking ahead though that impeachment might take [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=91.2s)]
*  Weeks if not months because of the just general bureaucracy of things if he were to be impeached though [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=96.84s)]
*  The prime minister would then at least technically be acting president [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=102.44s)]
*  But the point there the caveat there is that also he is not a very well-liked and he's also part of the ruling party [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=107.8s)]
*  Yeah, really complicated stuff. I'd be glad to have you on the ground there. Thank you very much [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Gs4oFNQsA&t=114.47999999999999s)]
