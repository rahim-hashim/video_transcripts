# CIA Director Burns on how intel has helped Ukraine's defense against Russia
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU)
*  You've got the whole world to watch right now. So I know you're a busy man. I want to start [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=0.0s)]
*  on Ukraine and Russia with this anniversary. On the cusp of Russia's invasion, you flew to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=4.72s)]
*  Kiev and you told President Zelensky, tell me if this is right, the Russians are coming to kill you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Was that the very first thing you said? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=18.0s)]
*  Wasn't the very first thing I said to President Zelensky, but President Biden had asked me to go [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=20.0s)]
*  to Kiev to lay out for President Zelensky the most recent intelligence we had, which suggested [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=24.16s)]
*  that what Vladimir Putin was planning was what he thought would be a lightning strike from the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=30.88s)]
*  Belarus border to seize Kiev in a matter of a few days and also to seize an airport just northwest [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=35.44s)]
*  of Kiev called Gostomel, which he wanted to use as a platform to bring in airborne troops as a way, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=42.16s)]
*  again, of accelerating that lightning conquest of Kiev. And I think President Zelensky understood [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=48.56s)]
*  what was at stake and what he was up against. Our Ukrainian intelligence partners also had good [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  intelligence about what was coming as well. But I do think that the role of intelligence in this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=59.68000000000001s)]
*  instance, what we're able to provide to President Zelensky, not just on that trip, but throughout [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=64.80000000000001s)]
*  the course of the war, have helped him to defend his country with such courage and tenacity. And I [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=69.68s)]
*  think that made a contribution early, just before the war started. Being able to share that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=75.44s)]
*  intelligence. Yes. You also have said, and tell me if this is correct, that it was only a group of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=80.32s)]
*  about three or four people around Vladimir Putin who knew that he was actually planning this invasion. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=86.16s)]
*  No, I think that's true. I mean, I had watched over the years, especially over recent years, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=94.64s)]
*  as Putin had narrowed his circle of advisors. And it was a circle in which he prized loyalty [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=100.32s)]
*  over competence. He was a group of people who tended to tell him what he wanted to hear, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=106.72s)]
*  or at least had learned over the years that it wasn't career enhancing to question his judgments [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=111.6s)]
*  as well. And so that was one of the deepest flaws, I think, in Russian decision making just before [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=115.92s)]
*  the war, as it was such a closed circle of people reinforcing one another's profoundly mistaken [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=121.68s)]
*  assumptions. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9smKzecLXU&t=127.36s)]
