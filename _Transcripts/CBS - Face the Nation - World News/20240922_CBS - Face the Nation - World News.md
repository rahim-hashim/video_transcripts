# Israeli President Isaac Herzog on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" | full interview
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0)
*  That was our Chris Livese from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=0.0s)]
*  We turn now to the president of Israel, Isaac Hirsog. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=3.44s)]
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=7.44s)]
*  Thank you, Margaret. Good morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=9.44s)]
*  Mr. President, in the past few days, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=11.44s)]
*  Israel carried out a groundbreaking operation [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=13.44s)]
*  against thousands of Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=17.04s)]
*  The U.S. was only given 20 minutes' notice ahead of time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=20.64s)]
*  Since then, Israel also carried out a strike in Beirut [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=24.04s)]
*  that killed senior commanders of Hezbollah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=28.08s)]
*  What is the strategy here, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=31.08s)]
*  and is Israel trying to escalate into a full-blown war with Hezbollah? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=33.08s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=39.08s)]
*  We did not want this war. We're not seeking war. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=41.08s)]
*  This war was waged upon us by the proxies of the Empire of Evil, of Iran, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=44.08s)]
*  on October 7th by Hamas, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=50.08s)]
*  and on October 8th by Hezbollah, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=53.08s)]
*  and ever since, from Lebanon in the north, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=56.12s)]
*  and of course from Hamas in the south, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=59.12s)]
*  and all over the Middle East, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=61.12s)]
*  the proxies of Iran are attacking and attacking. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=63.12s)]
*  Now, Hezbollah's been attacking us on a daily basis, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=66.12s)]
*  demolishing Israeli villages and towns, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=70.12s)]
*  basically leading to the eviction of 100,000 Israelis from their homes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=73.12s)]
*  Life has been shattered in our northern border. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=79.12s)]
*  I don't think any American would have accepted it [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=82.12s)]
*  as a kind of a status quo situation in the United States. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  And at the end, there are things that must be done. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  The duty of a government or a nation is to take care of its citizens [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  and bring them back home. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  And don't forget, it's 252 days, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  352 days, sorry, 352 days, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=102.16s)]
*  two weeks short of one year since our hostages were taken. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=105.16s)]
*  We have 101 hostages in the dungeons in Gaza [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=110.16s)]
*  already waiting and waiting, and we are pleading for them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=113.2s)]
*  Yes, and the U.S. is continuing its diplomatic efforts [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=116.2s)]
*  to bring those hostages home. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=119.2s)]
*  But on the issue of what's happening in the north of Israel right now, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=121.2s)]
*  the White House argues that a war in Lebanon [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=126.2s)]
*  is not the way to bring those 100,000 Israelis back into their homes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=129.2s)]
*  They want a diplomatic agreement about that blue line. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=135.2s)]
*  Do you think that the current government of Israel [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=139.23999999999998s)]
*  wants a diplomatic agreement? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  We never said that we don't want a diplomatic agreement. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  On the contrary, there is a very able American envoy, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  Amos Hochstein, the president's adviser, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  who's trying to go back and forth between us and the Lebanese. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  But truly, let's understand the situation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  When you're dealing with terror organizations, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  they don't really give a damn about international affairs. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=166.28s)]
*  They take hostages or they fire as much as they want. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=170.28s)]
*  They get instructions from Tehran. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=174.28s)]
*  They send Houthi terrorists to block the high seas [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=176.28s)]
*  and the cost of living in the world goes up. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=180.28s)]
*  This is the culture of terror, and it's a terror of jihadists, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=182.28s)]
*  meaning they don't give a damn about anything. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=186.28s)]
*  Now, we agree time and again to go into rounds of talks. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=188.28s)]
*  We support and welcome the efforts [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=193.32s)]
*  by the United States of America and the administration. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=196.32s)]
*  Truly, we respect it tremendously, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=199.32s)]
*  but at the end of it, okay, Mr. Hochstein leaves Israel [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=201.32s)]
*  and they keep on firing and firing, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=205.32s)]
*  and that cannot go on forever [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=207.32s)]
*  because our citizens must go back home [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=209.32s)]
*  because the guy in Lebanon, Mr. Nasrallah, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=212.32s)]
*  thinks that he wants to link it to Gaza. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=216.32s)]
*  And in Gaza, there's another arch terrorist [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=219.32s)]
*  Mr. Sinwar in the dungeons who doesn't want to get to a deal, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  refuses to get to a deal. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  This is jihadism at its best, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  and that's what we are fighting. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  And I wish, truly, and I say it [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  as the president of Israel officially, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  and I say it outright because I know we don't want war, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  but if it's waged against us, we go all the way. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, you say you don't want war, Mr. President. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  Israel moved its 98th division to the north of Israel this week. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  Your defense minister says the center of gravity [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=251.4s)]
*  is moving towards Lebanon. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=253.4s)]
*  What is the intention of those military moves, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=255.4s)]
*  if not to prepare for war? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  Because these guys who we eradicated on Friday [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  were gathering together in their apartment in Beirut [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  in order to plan another October 7th. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  They developed this school of thought [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  of swarming into Israel, of trying to take hostage, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=278.44s)]
*  of butchering, raping, burning, abducting. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=282.44s)]
*  Do you have evidence that an attack was imminent? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=285.44s)]
*  At the end, we have enough risks here to take care of. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=288.44s)]
*  Pardon? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=290.44s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=291.44s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=292.44s)]
*  You just mentioned, you said, I think there, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=293.44s)]
*  that the Hezbollah commanders that were killed [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=295.44s)]
*  in that Israeli airstrike were planning an attack. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=297.44s)]
*  Do you have evidence that there was an imminent attack? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=300.44s)]
*  So I can't go into all the information itself, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=304.44s)]
*  but it is assumed that they were planning an attack. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=307.48s)]
*  You see today, this morning, they took out a barrage [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=310.48s)]
*  of attacks on Israeli cities, towns and villages [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=315.48s)]
*  all over the northern part of Israel, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=319.48s)]
*  pounding with huge bombs and missiles [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=322.48s)]
*  on the northern part of Israel. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=325.48s)]
*  Why would any nation accept it? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=327.48s)]
*  Why would any decent nation accept it? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=329.48s)]
*  We're almost a year in such a situation [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=332.48s)]
*  of a kind of a vicious cycle. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  We want to get out of this vicious cycle [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  and if we have no choice, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  then we are getting ready for escalation, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  which we, again, we don't want to get there, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  but we make it clear that it's unacceptable anymore [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=348.52000000000004s)]
*  and we can't go on into this vicious cycle anymore. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  And the U.S. doesn't want that escalation [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  or to get drawn into the fight. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  I want to ask you about something else [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  that just happened overnight, Mr. President. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  The Israeli military raided and shuttered Al Jazeera, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=362.56s)]
*  the news network, their offices [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=365.56s)]
*  in the occupied West Bank for 45 days. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=367.56s)]
*  Why is Israel clamping down on the press there? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=370.56s)]
*  I must tell you, honestly, I'm unaware of this [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=373.56s)]
*  and I will check it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=376.56s)]
*  We were not informed about this at all. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=378.56s)]
*  So I don't know exactly what you're talking about [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=381.56s)]
*  and you allow me to study this issue. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=384.56s)]
*  It hasn't been reported to me [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=388.56s)]
*  because what we are seeing in Israel, of course, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=390.6s)]
*  is people's homes being burned and blown up [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=393.6s)]
*  and don't forget that these missiles are lethal. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=396.6s)]
*  We don't forget 12 children [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=400.6s)]
*  who were killed in a soccer game [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=403.6s)]
*  just about two months ago [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=406.6s)]
*  as they were playing soccer, bruised kids, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=408.6s)]
*  where they were playing with their Muslim friends [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=411.6s)]
*  and with their Jewish friends [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=414.6s)]
*  and they were playing with their Jewish friends [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=416.6s)]
*  and their Christian friends, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=419.64000000000004s)]
*  all the beautiful tapestry of the Israeli north. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=421.64000000000004s)]
*  And that is why we are, you know, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  what we have to do is we have to make sure [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=427.64000000000004s)]
*  that our citizens are not threatened anymore. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=430.64000000000004s)]
*  I want to ask you as well, though, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  because the United States and Israel are so close [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=434.64000000000004s)]
*  and there is concern here in the United States [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=437.64000000000004s)]
*  about some of the decisions being made by your government, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=440.64000000000004s)]
*  this past week the AP put out graphic footage [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  shot in the West Bank [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=447.68s)]
*  where Israeli soldiers pushed the bodies [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=448.68s)]
*  of Palestinians off the roof of buildings there. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=450.68s)]
*  The White House says they want an investigation, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=453.68s)]
*  that this is abhorrent and egregious behavior. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=455.68s)]
*  How do you respond to these concerns [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=458.68s)]
*  from one of your closest allies [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=461.68s)]
*  that Israel may be adding to escalation risk? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=463.68s)]
*  So we, of course, listen to our closest ally [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=468.68s)]
*  openly and frankly. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=471.68s)]
*  This is if it occurred as reported [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=473.72s)]
*  and it is under investigation [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=476.72s)]
*  because we are a nation of the rule of law. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=479.72s)]
*  We will, of course, take all necessary action. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=481.72s)]
*  We will condemn it and use all the legal steps [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=484.72s)]
*  that need to be taken against it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=488.72s)]
*  But we are studying it because we are a serious army [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=490.72s)]
*  and a serious people [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=494.72s)]
*  and we study and investigate ourselves as much as we can. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=495.72s)]
*  Look, we are a democracy. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=499.72s)]
*  Well, you have hundreds of thousands of Israelis, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=501.76000000000005s)]
*  for example, demonstrating every weekend [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=503.76000000000005s)]
*  against the government. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=506.76000000000005s)]
*  This is the basic right [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=507.76000000000005s)]
*  of every human being in our nation. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=509.76000000000005s)]
*  We are a very aggressive, active [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=511.76000000000005s)]
*  and vociferous democracy [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=513.76s)]
*  and I'm very proud of our nation [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=516.76s)]
*  which side by side with that [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=518.76s)]
*  is mobilizing so many tens [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=520.76s)]
*  and tens of thousands of Israelis [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=523.76s)]
*  from age 18 all the way to age of 96 [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=525.76s)]
*  who actually mobilized and volunteered [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=529.8s)]
*  and went to fight and go to fight [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=532.8s)]
*  all for one reason. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=534.8s)]
*  All we want is to live in peace [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=536.8s)]
*  and we deserve it as any other nation [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=538.8s)]
*  but the Iranian regime with a jihadist ideology, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=541.8s)]
*  they decided they want to launch [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=545.8s)]
*  a whole campaign against us [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=547.8s)]
*  and I think this is the real watershed in the world. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=549.8s)]
*  The world has to stop this. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=553.8s)]
*  The world has to be with us [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=555.8s)]
*  and the world has to understand [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  that we are fighting for the free world [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=559.8399999999999s)]
*  and we must bring our hostages back home [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=561.8399999999999s)]
*  as soon as possible. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  This is the biggest plight of humanity [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=565.8399999999999s)]
*  at this current stage. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=567.8399999999999s)]
*  And I know so many people hope those hostages [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=569.8399999999999s)]
*  including the four remaining Americans [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=572.8399999999999s)]
*  come home. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=574.8399999999999s)]
*  Before I let you go, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=575.8399999999999s)]
*  do you think that President Biden's efforts [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=576.8399999999999s)]
*  to negotiate that hostage deal [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=578.8399999999999s)]
*  is just wishful thinking at this point? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  Will this be a problem [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=583.8399999999999s)]
*  for the American president? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=585.88s)]
*  So actually I would say that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=587.88s)]
*  I have huge respect [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=589.88s)]
*  for President Biden's effort [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=591.88s)]
*  and we support it wholeheartedly [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=593.88s)]
*  but as the spokesperson [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=595.88s)]
*  of the National Security Council [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=597.88s)]
*  General Kirby just said the other day [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=599.88s)]
*  we are not getting any positive signs [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=602.88s)]
*  from Hamas at all, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=605.88s)]
*  from Sinwar. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=607.88s)]
*  He's out there in the dungeons [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=608.88s)]
*  taking whatever we think [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=610.88s)]
*  in our line of thinking [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=613.92s)]
*  as free loving nations and peoples [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=615.92s)]
*  he thinks the other way. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=618.92s)]
*  But I would say [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=619.92s)]
*  that actually the call for [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=621.92s)]
*  the family of nations [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=623.92s)]
*  in this current crisis [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=625.92s)]
*  which is boiling hot [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=626.92s)]
*  is actually perhaps the opportunity [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=628.92s)]
*  to go forward and change the situation [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=630.92s)]
*  by finding the right exit [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=633.92s)]
*  and bringing the hostages back home. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=635.92s)]
*  Mr. President, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=638.92s)]
*  thank you for your time this morning. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=639.92s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=641.9599999999999s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaCUd99Iu0&t=643.9599999999999s)]
