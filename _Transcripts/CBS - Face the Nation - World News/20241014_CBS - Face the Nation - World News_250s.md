# What we know about Hezbollah drone attack that killed Israeli troops on army base
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s)
*  All right, as we just told you, we're going to begin with developments out of the Middle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=0.0s)]
*  East, where at least four Israeli troops have been killed and dozens more injured in a Hezbollah [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=3.0s)]
*  drone attack on an army base in central Israel. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=7.88s)]
*  Now, this all comes as the Biden administration has announced that the United States will [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=11.36s)]
*  send a missile defense system along with troops to operate it in Israel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  A U.S. official tells CBS News that around 100 troops will be sent to the country. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  For more on this, I want to bring in CBS News foreign correspondent, Rami Nissencio. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=25.28s)]
*  He's tracking all the developments for us this morning from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=29.16s)]
*  So Rami, you've been up to this Israeli base that was struck in that Hezbollah drone attack. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=33.08s)]
*  What more are we learning about this incident? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=38.4s)]
*  Vlad, hi there. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=40.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's only it's only about an hour's drive from here in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=42.24s)]
*  And we're understanding that this is one of the most lethal strikes to hit Israel since [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=46.36s)]
*  the war started on October 7th of last year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  And what Israel is now trying to learn is how that drone exactly got through the country's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=54.26s)]
*  advanced air defenses. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=59.62s)]
*  We know that those defenses are precise, they're high tech, and they are some of the best really [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=61.019999999999996s)]
*  in the world. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=65.02s)]
*  Some local media reported that that drone was flying low to the ground, which may have [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=66.06s)]
*  helped it evade surveillance. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=70.1s)]
*  It was then able to fly south by some 60, 65 miles south from Lebanon, target that air [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=72.58s)]
*  the Golan air base, which we understand trains up raw military recruits, then smash through [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=79.3s)]
*  the roof of a dining hall, killing and wounding all of those soldiers. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=84.62s)]
*  And that attack does show Vlad that Hezbollah can strike deeper into Israel beyond the border [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=88.22s)]
*  area. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=93.42s)]
*  The militant group said it was in retaliation for two Israeli strikes just last week on [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=94.42s)]
*  Thursday in Beirut that killed more than 20 people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=98.5s)]
*  Yeah, we had always reported you and our other foreign correspondents, Remy, that Hezbollah [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=103.62s)]
*  was a very different enemy than Hamas. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=108.42s)]
*  And we're seeing that play out now, sadly, tragically. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=111.26s)]
*  Let's talk about what we know about this deployment of these U.S. troops along with that new missile [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=114.66000000000001s)]
*  defense system. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=119.98s)]
*  Yeah, we're talking about FAD here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=122.02000000000001s)]
*  It stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=125.56s)]
*  And this can shoot down ballistic missiles. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=129.86s)]
*  A U.S. official confirms around 100 U.S. troops are also being deployed here to help operate [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=132.94s)]
*  that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=138.54000000000002s)]
*  And the context of this is that this is happening as we wait for Israel to potentially retaliate [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=139.54000000000002s)]
*  against Iran. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=144.9s)]
*  And that is after Iran retaliated against Israel two weeks ago. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=145.9s)]
*  That was on October 1st. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=149.18s)]
*  And the key here is that that was with about 180 ballistic missiles. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=150.54000000000002s)]
*  The last time the U.S. deployed a FAD battery was just after Hamas attacked Israel back [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=155.3s)]
*  on October 7th of last year. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  There was concern Iran and Hezbollah would join in that attack. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=161.5s)]
*  And the Pentagon said that this new deployment is what they're saying part of a broader adjustments [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  to keep supporting Israel and to keep protecting Americans here from those attacks from Iran [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=169.94s)]
*  and from militias that are aligned with Iran across the region. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=175.38s)]
*  And it's smart to note that this green light came straight from President Biden to the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  Pentagon. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=182.62s)]
*  And this deployment is now happening. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=183.62s)]
*  All right, Remy, thanks so much for your reporting. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=187.94s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=189.58s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=190.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=191.58s)]
*  The head of the U.N.'s refugee agency has warned this morning that the situation in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=193.58s)]
*  Lebanon could worsen further. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=198.06s)]
*  More than a million people have been displaced by the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=200.0s)]
*  Our Deborah Pata has more on the impact the conflict is having on civilians. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=203.26s)]
*  I'm in central Beirut where you can see people have pitched tents forced to sleep out in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=208.26s)]
*  the street. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=214.3s)]
*  Already more than 1.2 million people in this country have fled war. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=215.3s)]
*  That's around a quarter of Lebanon's total population. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=220.82000000000002s)]
*  They've fled from the south. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=223.86s)]
*  They fled from the Bekaa Valley and even from nearby the southern suburbs in Dakhia. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=225.3s)]
*  And they fled because of this war. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=231.06s)]
*  There are shelters, but there's simply not enough room in the shelters for all these [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=233.18s)]
*  displaced people. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=238.74s)]
*  And many tell us that the government is doing absolutely nothing to help, which is why they [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=240.66000000000003s)]
*  are now forced to sleep out in the street. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-4V2EiU7s&t=246.9s)]
