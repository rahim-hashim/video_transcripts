# NATO chief says Viktor Orbán's visit to Moscow does not change NATO's position on Ukraine
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko)
*  Leaders of America's closest European allies will be coming to Washington this week for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=0.0s)]
*  the annual NATO summit. NATO Secretary General Jan Sultenberg is here. Good morning, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=4.0s)]
*  Secretary General. Great to have you here at the table. Let me read you a headline from [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=8.24s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal. Quote, the world saw President Biden deteriorating. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Democrats ignored warnings. European leaders and officials expressed worries about his [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=16.84s)]
*  focus and stamina. You're meeting with NATO leaders this week in Washington. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=20.8s)]
*  You're close with President Biden and many other NATO leaders. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=24.84s)]
*  What's your real take on the private assessment of the president of the United States among NATO leaders? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=28.36s)]
*  I'm absolutely confident that when all NATO leaders convene here this week it will be a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=34.12s)]
*  great summit. We will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the most successful alliance in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=39.44s)]
*  history. And I just met President Biden in the Oval Office a couple of weeks ago and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=44.56s)]
*  that was a good and productive meeting where we prepared all the important decisions we [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=49.8s)]
*  made here on defense, on support for Ukraine, and not least on burnishing that European [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=54.0s)]
*  allies are now really stepping up and spending record amount of money on defense, and of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  course also on China and our need to work together. So this is a substance of the summit [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=64.2s)]
*  and of course these decisions would not have been possible to make without a strong U.S. leadership. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=69.44s)]
*  There's no question the substance is what matters. We just heard from Senator Lindsey [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=74.64s)]
*  Graham of South Carolina, a Republican who's close to the Republican nominee. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=78.36s)]
*  He's saying he has concerns that world leaders don't trust President Biden to be in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=82.52s)]
*  command of the job. You speak privately with these people. What's the truth here? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=86.88s)]
*  Are there concerns or not among NATO leaders? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  But if I started to comment on issues like that then suddenly NATO, I, will be part of domestic debate. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=95.36s)]
*  Well, it would be easy to just say no or yes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=101.08s)]
*  But I think it's important for NATO to stay out of that kind of domestic discussions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=103.52s)]
*  They are, of course, important in the United States, but NATO should not be part of it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=107.96s)]
*  What matters for NATO is the decisions, what you do together. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=111.72s)]
*  And just for instance on defense spending, which has been a big issue for the United States [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=115.6s)]
*  for many years under different presidents. When we made the pledge 10 years ago to increase [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=120.88s)]
*  defense spending, only three allies spent 2% of GDP on defense. This year it's 23 allies. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=127.0s)]
*  And increase just this year, 18% across Europe and Canada. So record high investments by European allies. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=133.32s)]
*  I understand you want to focus on that. But you've just been with President Biden, as you said, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=140.11999999999998s)]
*  in the Oval Office. What's your personal assessment? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=144.16s)]
*  Is he someone you can work with in an effective way on the policy issues? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  We had a good, we had a productive meeting. And of course, there is no way to make these big [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=150.83999999999997s)]
*  decisions on how to further strengthen NATO, enlarge NATO, new members without having a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=155.32s)]
*  strong U.S. leadership. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=161.72s)]
*  Why such a long timeline to bring in Ukraine? You've talked about a 10-year window. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=164.16s)]
*  Why is it 10 years versus maybe one or two or three years since they're facing war? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=168.84s)]
*  Well, no one has said exactly 10 years. But it's obvious that it is a very serious issue to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=172.56s)]
*  bring in Ukraine because Ukraine is now a country at war. Ukraine has been attacked by Russia. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=177.96s)]
*  So the most important thing we should do is to step up our support to Ukraine to ensure that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=185.72s)]
*  Ukraine prevails. That's a precondition for any future membership for Ukraine. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=190.92s)]
*  Stay with us. We'll have more questions for the secretary-general soon. Please stay with us. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=196.72s)]
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with the NATO secretary-general. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  Secretary-general Soltenberg, thanks for sticking around with us. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=209.08s)]
*  What are the specific deliverables of this NATO summit, especially when it comes to whether [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  there could be training and an alliance plan for NATO troops with Ukraine? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, we make important decisions on stepping up our support to Ukraine. NATO will take over the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=221.32000000000002s)]
*  provision and the coordination of security assistance to Ukraine and also training. We will [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=227.16000000000003s)]
*  have a command established in Germany and with logistical hubs in the eastern part of the alliance [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=234.52s)]
*  to help to get over the equipment, the ammunition and also the training for Ukrainian forces. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=241.24s)]
*  This is a big and important deliverable from the summit to ensure a more robust framework for our [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=246.84s)]
*  support to Ukraine. So the NATO leaders are in Washington focusing on that deliverable, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=251.88s)]
*  but the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on Friday was just in Moscow meeting with Vladimir [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=255.8s)]
*  Putin. Would you discourage him to continue those talks and should he let NATO handle this at this point? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=260.52s)]
*  Prime Minister Orbán, he made it clear when he came to Moscow that he didn't go there on behalf of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=268.92s)]
*  NATO, different NATO allies interact with Moscow in different ways. What matters for me is that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=274.28s)]
*  all allies have agreed that we need to do more for Ukraine, both with this new training and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  assistance that NATO will provide to Ukraine, but also with the long-term pledge. And I also [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=288.68s)]
*  expect that by the summit that starts next week, allies will make new announcements on more air [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=293.88s)]
*  defence and more ammunition. So yes, Hungary have, also Prime Minister Orbán has been in Moscow, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=299.8s)]
*  but that doesn't change the common decisions you have made as NATO. Does it affect NATO in any way [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  to have Orbán doing his own thing? No, because the reality is that we are able to make decisions [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=312.2s)]
*  on how we are going to step up our support to Ukraine, because we all want peace. The thing is [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=319.16s)]
*  that the easiest way to end the war is to lose the war, but that's not peace, that's occupation. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=326.52s)]
*  So therefore we need a lasting just peace and the only way to get there is to convince President [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=333.88s)]
*  Putin that he will not win on the battlefield. He has to sit down and accept a solution where [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  Ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent nation in Europe and the only way to convince Putin that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  he will not win on the battlefield is to provide military support to Ukraine. So a negotiated [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=349.08s)]
*  solution that is lasting for Ukraine requires military support to Ukraine. It's notable, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=353.72s)]
*  Secretary General, that Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea will be joining this summit. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=360.20000000000005s)]
*  Is this about trying to come up with a strategy for China as China works with Russia on its war [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=366.12s)]
*  with Ukraine? Yes, very much so, because the war in Ukraine demonstrates how closely aligned Russia [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  and China and North Korea and Iran are. China is the main enabler of Russia's war aggression against [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=377.56s)]
*  Ukraine. President Xi and President Putin, they all want NATO, the United States, to fail in Ukraine [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=385.48s)]
*  and if Putin wins in Ukraine, it will not only embolden President Putin, also embolden President Xi. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=391.88s)]
*  As the Japanese Prime Minister said, what happens in Ukraine today can happen in Asia tomorrow. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=398.2s)]
*  So it demonstrates that NATO is important for the United States also in terms of addressing China. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=405.24s)]
*  The United States is big, but in NATO you have something that no other big power has and that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=410.36s)]
*  is more than 30 friends and allies. The United States is 25 percent of the world's GDP, together [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=415.32s)]
*  with NATO allies, twice as much, 50 percent of the world's economic and military might. So the United [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=422.44s)]
*  States is stronger also in addressing China together with NATO. And last thing here quickly, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=428.68s)]
*  Secretary General, last week the American military's European command raised the threat [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=433.4s)]
*  level at bases on the continent to what's called Charlie. That's the second highest of five [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=437.4s)]
*  threat levels. Do you share as the leader of NATO this heightened concern about security in Europe? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=442.76s)]
*  Yes, we always have to be vigilant and aware of threat of terrorist actions and therefore it is [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=449.96s)]
*  important that the U.S. command is vigilant and take the decisions on alert levels which they [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=458.84s)]
*  deem necessary. What's driving it? Is it Gaza, Ukraine, the Olympics? It is a combination. It's [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=465.23999999999995s)]
*  always a bit dangerous or difficult to go into the details of intelligence, but NATO, the U.S., [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=470.84s)]
*  we have to be aware of the constant threat of new terrorist attacks and that's exactly what we are [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=476.91999999999996s)]
*  by also exchanging more intelligence and working together. Secretary General Stoltenberg, thanks [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=481.47999999999996s)]
*  for being here. We appreciate it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ps_6Pe4Ko&t=485.8s)]
