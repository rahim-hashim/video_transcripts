# Israelis support more measured response to Iran if action would threaten their alliances
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A)
*  With more on the view from Israel and Iran is CBS News foreign correspondent MTS Tayyib. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=0.0s)]
*  MTS. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Margaret, while it's no secret, Israel and Iran have long been engaged in what's often [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  described as a shadow war. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  The events of the past few weeks have pushed this decades-long and deeply bitter rivalry [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  out into the Okan like never before. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=21.44s)]
*  As you were reporting, Iran's missile and drone attack on Israel last weekend was in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=24.12s)]
*  to an apparent Israeli strike on one of Tehran's diplomatic facilities in Syria killing top [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=29.28s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard commanders. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=35.4s)]
*  And also mark the first time Tehran has ever tried to target Israel inside Israeli territory [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=37.28s)]
*  directly, setting an extremely dangerous precedent that has the potential of establishing a worrying [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=43.2s)]
*  new norm between these arch rivals. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=50.16s)]
*  One where they now strike each other's territory directly like Israel did inside Iran on Friday [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=53.28s)]
*  and the other response in kind and saying that given Israel's limited response and Tehran's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=58.24s)]
*  muted reaction, it's clear the Biden administration and other world powers attempts to deescalate [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=64.64s)]
*  between the two nations has worked at least for now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  So empty, as you mentioned, the shadow war and Israel has been conducting covert action [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=75.56s)]
*  for years, but we know since October 7th, Israeli leaders have tried to reestablish [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=80.04s)]
*  what they call deterrence, getting all of its enemies to be too afraid to come and attack [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=86.63999999999999s)]
*  them. Do Israelis feel this overt action did that? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=91.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good question and a very complicated picture. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=97.44s)]
*  While most Israelis remain intensely enraged at Hamas, Iran is not far from their minds. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=100.24s)]
*  And while Israel's extreme far right minister for national security, it's more than Gavir [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=106.63999999999999s)]
*  called Israel's retaliatory strike on Friday in a tweet as and I'm quoting here, feeble [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=112.44s)]
*  and other members of Netanyahu's far right coalition urging him to. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=117.84s)]
*  And again, I'm quoting here, go berserk on Tehran. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=122.0s)]
*  The Israeli public appear to be far more measured and pragmatic. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  In fact, a recent poll from the Hebrew University found 74 percent of Israelis opposed a major [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=129.2s)]
*  strike on Iran following its drone and missile attack if it would harm Israel's security [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=137.36s)]
*  alliance with other allies, including the U.S. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=143.96s)]
*  And saying that, 44 percent of Israelis also back a military offensive against Hamas in [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  the southern city of Rafa, where at least one point two million Palestinians are sheltering, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=152.84s)]
*  even at the cost of Israel's foreign relations. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=158.56s)]
*  Margaret. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  Empty as time. Thank you. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7gb5rP54A&t=163.24s)]
