# Taiwan's representative to U.S. says risk of escalation "posed by Beijing"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI)
*  On Friday, I sat down with Taiwan's representative to the U.S., Xiao Bi Kim, for the CBS Evening [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=0.0s)]
*  News. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=6.4s)]
*  Here's more of our interview. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=7.4s)]
*  President Biden indicated the military wasn't enthusiastic about Speaker Pelosi visiting. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=9.24s)]
*  She spoke openly about the risk of her plane being shot down. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=15.88s)]
*  Did Taiwan ever have that level of concern that there was a risk here? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=19.68s)]
*  We have been living under the threat from China for decades. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=24.64s)]
*  And we cannot let their ongoing threats define our desire to make friends internationally. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=30.84s)]
*  If you have a kid being bullied at school, you don't say you don't go to school. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=40.32s)]
*  You try to find a way to deal with the bully. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  And that's exactly what Taiwan is doing, working on making our society stronger and more resilient. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=48.92s)]
*  Fortifying our defenses so that we have means of managing risks. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=55.32s)]
*  The risks are not posed by Taiwan, nor are they posed by the United States. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  The risks are posed by Beijing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  What specifically is that risk? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=68.08s)]
*  Is it a full-scale invasion? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=70.22s)]
*  Well, the Chinese have not renounced the use of force. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=71.88s)]
*  They have been intensifying threats towards Taiwan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=76.68s)]
*  That is not only on a military level. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=81.08000000000001s)]
*  It has involved a hybrid toolkit of public disinformation, cyber attacks, economic coercion. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  They have a broad toolkit that we have become more and more accustomed to. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=93.30000000000001s)]
*  But again, that is not going to change our determination to defend our freedom. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=98.0s)]
*  What's happening right now is unprecedented. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=106.76s)]
*  Beijing has sent 68 warplanes, 13 warships right off your coast. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=110.44s)]
*  Do you believe that this is just a drill? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=115.48s)]
*  Well, indeed, China's behavior is unprecedented. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=118.88s)]
*  And from the scope and the actions, it appears that they have been preparing for this for [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=122.92s)]
*  some time, way before Speaker Pelosi decided to visit Taiwan. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=129.56s)]
*  China is seemingly showing that it can blockade Taiwan, that it can cut you off from the rest [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=135.72s)]
*  of the world. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=142.44s)]
*  What is the cost of doing something like that? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=143.7s)]
*  Well, China has been building up their military capacities rapidly over recent years. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  And what they are doing through these exercises has the potential of jeopardizing some of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=154.24s)]
*  the most important air and sea commercial routes. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=159.68s)]
*  I believe they will also jeopardize China's interest in a stable environment under which [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=164.96s)]
*  trade and commerce can function. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=171.08s)]
*  Such risky and dangerous behavior has implications for the world. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=172.96s)]
*  Do you have any assurances from the Biden White House that they would defend you, not [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=176.8s)]
*  just sell you weapons, as presidents have for the past 40 years, but actually come to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  your defense? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=187.96s)]
*  We have a very strong security partnership that ensures the protection of our shared [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=188.96s)]
*  interests in the regional peace and stability. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=194.68s)]
*  Do you believe the timeline for an invasion is moving up? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=197.72s)]
*  The criticism of what Speaker Pelosi did by visiting is that she is provoking China. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=201.0s)]
*  Well, I think the word provocation has only one place, and that's with China right now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=206.68s)]
*  They are the ones that are provoking regional instability. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=212.72s)]
*  So you do not think that this was a mistake and that this visit has backfired? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=216.08s)]
*  Well, the visit has been welcomed by the Taiwanese people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=221.4s)]
*  Sometimes it's hard for other countries from afar to fully understand the feelings and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=226.96s)]
*  perspectives of the Taiwanese people. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=232.26000000000002s)]
*  And that is for too long. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=235.24s)]
*  We have been bullied, isolated, and suppressed and banned from international organizations. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=237.74s)]
*  So when friends come from afar and wish to lend their support to Taiwan, we generally [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=244.58s)]
*  take that with gratitude. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=250.38000000000002s)]
*  When you talk to Biden administration officials, they will say Xi Jinping, the president of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=252.10000000000002s)]
*  China, is taking notes. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=257.94s)]
*  He is watching what Vladimir Putin is doing right now in Ukraine as a test case to see [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=259.54s)]
*  what he can get away with in Taiwan. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=265.06s)]
*  What lesson do you think he's learning right now? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=268.90000000000003s)]
*  I think we are all learning lessons. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=271.3s)]
*  And the Taiwanese people are also learning lessons. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=273.58s)]
*  And we are learning that we have to be better prepared. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=276.97999999999996s)]
*  We have to be stronger in our own self-defenses. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=280.64s)]
*  We have to work hard to galvanize international support in working to deter that tragic scenario [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=284.8s)]
*  from ever happening. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=295.06s)]
*  Are you concerned that the West won't stand by Taiwan the way it has stood by Ukraine? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=297.14s)]
*  China is financially so powerful, it would be hard for the West to cut it off. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=304.82s)]
*  Well, I think that was one of the messages that Speaker Pelosi was trying to convey. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=311.46s)]
*  And that is, despite all challenges, we have friends in the international community who [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=318.06s)]
*  will stand with us. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=324.94s)]
*  And lastly, China has also flexed its diplomatic muscles. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=327.38s)]
*  It cut off a number of agreements, it says, with the United States because of this visit, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=331.02s)]
*  including collaboration on climate change. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=336.7s)]
*  Are you concerned that the West will look at this and say, it's not worth it, not just [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=339.14s)]
*  on climate change, but on other priorities that outrank Taiwan? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=345.18s)]
*  Well, are we concerned? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=350.22s)]
*  Yes, we are concerned about the disruption of these very important discussions on global [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=352.82s)]
*  issues that are matters of interest to not only the United States, but to China and everyone [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=358.1s)]
*  in the world. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=364.7s)]
*  But the fact is, again, congressional visits to Taiwan have been ongoing for decades. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=366.86s)]
*  And for decades, it hasn't prevented the United States and China from having constructive [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=374.68s)]
*  discussions on matters of mutual interest. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=379.78s)]
*  And I agree with some of the US White House and other statements and the analyses that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=383.5s)]
*  the Beijing government is currently trying to manufacture a crisis over a practice that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  has been ongoing for decades. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=399.96s)]
*  And they are using this as a pretext. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=403.14s)]
*  And I think we have to make that clear. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=406.5s)]
*  If China is to evolve as a responsible stakeholder in the global community, it's really up to [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  Beijing to decide if their rejuvenation, if China's rejuvenation will evolve with international [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=417.9s)]
*  respect or with international condemnation. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=426.17999999999995s)]
*  Our full conversation is on our website and YouTube channel. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=430.7s)]
*  We'll be back in a moment. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEWiknSuUzI&t=434.02s)]
