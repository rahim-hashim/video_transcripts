# Cousin of slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah emerging as his replacement
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI)
*  We begin with mounting fears of an all-out war in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=0.0s)]
*  Our Imtiaz Tayeb reports from Lebanon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=4.12s)]
*  In this just-released Hezbollah video, the apparent burial shroud of Hassan Nasrallah, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=9.8s)]
*  inscribed in Arabic with the words, he was martyred on the way to Jerusalem. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=14.96s)]
*  As grief gripped supporters of the assassinated Hezbollah leader following the confirmation [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=20.56s)]
*  of his death. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=25.36s)]
*  Many wept as they stood amid the jagged concrete and twisted metal left by massive bunker-busting [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=27.08s)]
*  bombs used to target the towering figure, who was seemingly invincible. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  But Nasrallah, who had been in hiding for years, was ultimately no match for Israel's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=38.2s)]
*  military might or its breathtaking intelligence capabilities after Israeli forces found and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=42.6s)]
*  assassinated him at a time of sky-high tensions. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=48.76s)]
*  On the streets of the Iranian capital, Tehran, more sorrow. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=52.720000000000006s)]
*  Hezbollah has long been backed by Iran. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=56.68s)]
*  And Nasrallah's killing is also a major blow to his key ally, the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=59.24s)]
*  But for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who approved the strike that killed him, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=64.8s)]
*  a major victory. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=70.12s)]
*  Citizens of Israel, these are great days, he said. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=72.16s)]
*  We are at what appears to be a historic turning point. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=75.48s)]
*  That turning point hangs on how Hezbollah will now respond. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  But following the assassinations of Nasrallah and several of the group's top commanders, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=82.6s)]
*  its leadership has been decapitated and its fighting forces in disarray. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  When the enemy kills the leadership or captures it or decapitates it, the movement comes back [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  stronger and more militant and therefore more of a threat. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  So I think the Israeli people are not necessarily going to be safer or feel safer. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=103.04s)]
*  In the still-smoking wreckage of the Beirut neighborhood where Nasrallah was killed, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=109.2s)]
*  the scale of Israel's actions here and the fear of what it could trigger saw President [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=113.56s)]
*  Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin both insist they were not warned of the attack [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=118.36s)]
*  in advance. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=123.18s)]
*  The White House has long feared a major escalation between Israel and Hezbollah could trigger [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=124.48s)]
*  a regional war that would not only draw in Iran but potentially the U.S. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=129.24s)]
*  As Israel continues to devastate Gaza for nearly a year now, with Hezbollah still insisting [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=134.52s)]
*  it won't stop firing rockets at Israel until there is a ceasefire there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=141.52s)]
*  And MTS joins us now from Beirut. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  MTS, has Israel delivered a fatal blow to Hezbollah with these strikes? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=149.88s)]
*  You know, Bob, I used to live here in Beirut and have been reporting on Lebanon and Hezbollah [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  for years now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  And Hassan Nasrallah, while loved by many and hated by some, almost all here strongly [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  admired his fierce resistance to Israel. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  But his assassination in that massive Israeli strike is likely not a fatal blow to Hezbollah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=170.28s)]
*  Now that's because Nasrallah didn't rule as an autocrat. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=176.48s)]
*  And today it appears Hashem Safedin will emerge as his replacement. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=179.88s)]
*  Safedin is a first cousin of Nasrallah and bears a striking resemblance to him. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=184.44s)]
*  The 60-year-old led the group's executive council and he is a staunch supporter of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  Palestinian cause and is extremely close to Iran, signaling he may rule quite similarly [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  to Nasrallah. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=201.24s)]
*  Now back in 2017, the U.S. also added Safedin to the terrorist blacklist. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=202.24s)]
*  Bob. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=207.72s)]
*  MTS, thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeNX3mFNaPI&t=208.72s)]
