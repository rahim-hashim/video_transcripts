# Iran begins 5 days of mourning for Raisi, other officials killed in helicopter crash
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0)
*  Iran has begun five days of national mourning for the nation's president, foreign minister, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=0.0s)]
*  and other officials who were killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=5.2s)]
*  The body of President Ibrahim Raisi arrived in the capital city of Tehran this morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=8.52s)]
*  State media released video showing military officials lined along a red carpet to escort [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=14.0s)]
*  the coffin. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=19.66s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News' senior foreign correspondent, Charlie Dagata from London. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=20.66s)]
*  Charlie, thanks for joining. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=25.2s)]
*  What can we expect to see in terms of these funeral ceremonies over the next few days? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=27.74s)]
*  Yes, well, you know, as you said, five days of mourning, in this case, that's going [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=33.54s)]
*  to be five days of tributes and ceremonies. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=36.78s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people have already turned out. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  Again, not just for Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi, but the foreign minister, six other [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=42.099999999999994s)]
*  people that were killed in that helicopter crash. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=46.739999999999995s)]
*  There has been a procession, as you're seeing some of those images, from the northwestern [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=49.8s)]
*  city of Tabriz. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=53.86s)]
*  That's where the helicopter was headed when it crashed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=54.86s)]
*  It then went to the Shiite clerical center of Qom before being moved to Tehran. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=57.56s)]
*  The official main ceremony is taking place this afternoon, or this evening, in Iran. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  I think you might be seeing live pictures in a minute. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=66.56s)]
*  Iranian state TV said the funerals were attended by hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=68.92s)]
*  Iran's highest body, that's the Supreme National Security Council, said, you know, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=73.68s)]
*  this vast presence of mourners is a guarantee of the stability and national security of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=78.08s)]
*  the Islamic Republic. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=83.68s)]
*  What is the latest on the investigation into what caused the helicopter crash? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=86.16s)]
*  Yeah, Liliya, there's still a lot of mystery around it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=90.96s)]
*  We know the helicopter crashed in a mountainous region in thick fog. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=93.6s)]
*  Iran says an investigation is underway. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=97.44s)]
*  Now, interestingly, yesterday, as you may know, the State Department said Iran had asked [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=99.32s)]
*  for American assistance when the helicopter disappeared. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=103.32s)]
*  State says they were unable to provide that assistance for what they called logistical [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=106.84s)]
*  reasons, without elaborating. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=110.32s)]
*  So Iran has not provided any official word on the cause of the crash. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=112.44s)]
*  But again, we have to underline this is an old helicopter, 40, 45 years old. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=115.4s)]
*  It probably lacked the modern equipment to navigate through the fog and darkness and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  through the mountains. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=125.16s)]
*  A former Iranian government official blamed U.S. sanctions on a lack of aviation parts [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=126.16s)]
*  that would have kept helicopters like that airworthy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=130.52s)]
*  Of course, some voices in Iran have hinted at sabotage. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=133.4s)]
*  For the record, Israel has denied any involvement. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=137.0s)]
*  I mean, the fog looks very dense in those images of the recovery. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=139.88s)]
*  You talked about how that mass show of mourning and solidarity means to stability in the country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  What does Raisi's death mean for Iran's hardline government? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  And ultimately, the future of the country, will it remain along those same lines? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=156.96s)]
*  So ultimately, that's the big question. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  It's important that the supreme leader came out—important to note, anyway—came out [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=164.84s)]
*  and said there would be no disruption in the running of the country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=168.0s)]
*  Clearly, they're addressing that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=171.12s)]
*  So, under the nation's laws, a new election will be held in 50 days—well, 50 days from [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=173.2s)]
*  yesterday, 49 now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=177.2s)]
*  Our colleague in Iran helped give us a perspective. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=179.68s)]
*  He said it's more like the vice president died, in terms of who really holds the influence [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=181.72s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=185.72s)]
*  The question now is whether there will be a succession crisis. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=186.8s)]
*  Raisi had widely been expected to take over from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=190.12s)]
*  He's 85 years old, not in the best of health. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=194.88s)]
*  So it could now go to his son, Mojtabo, who's now entered the spotlight as a possible successor. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  And what's important to note here, there's little likelihood of a moderate or sort of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=203.56s)]
*  Western-leaning president, because the candidates are chosen from the Iranian regime. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=208.11999999999998s)]
*  So there may be some political intrigue, but this isn't a power vacuum. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=213.0s)]
*  In terms of Iran changing direction, it will be, as the Ayatollah suggested, business as [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  usual. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=223.2s)]
*  Charlie Dagata, thank you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=224.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK-OPuYtMi0&t=226.32s)]
