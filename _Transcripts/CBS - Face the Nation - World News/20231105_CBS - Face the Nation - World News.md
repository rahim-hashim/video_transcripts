# Oksana Markarova, Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S., says "war on terror has to be won everywhere"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U)
*  And we're back with Ukraine's ambassador to the United States Oksana Markova. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning and good to have you back here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=4.64s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Good to be back. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Your president has said that the war in the Middle East is diverting some attention from [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=8.84s)]
*  the war that's happening in Ukraine. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=13.36s)]
*  And he said that's part of Russia's goals. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=15.96s)]
*  So I want to hear from you where you think the conflict is, because I know that Ukraine [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  has said it is running very short of U.S. provided aid. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=25.32s)]
*  Well, it's the war still continues the way it was going. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=29.96s)]
*  You know, the front line is 800 kilometers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=33.88s)]
*  It's 620th day. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=36.12s)]
*  And the battle continues on all of these 800 miles, actually, not kilometers, miles. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=38.44s)]
*  It's longer than from here to Chicago. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=46.28s)]
*  So we do need ammunition. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=48.2s)]
*  We do need air defense. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=50.84s)]
*  We need all of the capabilities that we have been receiving and we were discussing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=52.08s)]
*  And of course, you know, right now, all the eyes are on U.S. Congress because we need [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=57.48s)]
*  the continuation of that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  We already ran out of some of the programs. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  We completely utilized them. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  And yes, we have, thanks to the planning and Congress and administration, some remain in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=67.92s)]
*  money that we're using. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=73.52s)]
*  But the time is of the essence. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  And of course, Russia is not only trying. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=78.12s)]
*  We see all these visits of Hamas and Iran to Russia. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  We see how Iran and North Korea help Russia to fight, but also Russia helping a lot of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=84.2s)]
*  them and helping Hamas openly. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=90.68s)]
*  So, you know, we just have to understand that this war on terror have to be won everywhere [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  and that we cannot afford to lose focus in one place or another. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=99.48s)]
*  That's why in order to be able to stop not only Russia, but other terroristic regimes, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=103.64s)]
*  we also have to win in Ukraine. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  You're talking about the fact that Hamas leaders recently visited Russia and that Iran is providing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  drones for Russia to use against your people in Ukraine. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=115.88s)]
*  The new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, has changed his positions publicly on Ukraine. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=119.56s)]
*  He did recently say he doesn't want Vladimir Putin to win and that he would bundle any [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=124.88s)]
*  Ukraine aid with U.S. border aid. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=130.04s)]
*  Has he agreed to meet with you? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=132.68s)]
*  Can you persuade him to move quickly? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=134.16s)]
*  Well, I would be happy to meet, of course, whenever there will be time and opportunity. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=136.8s)]
*  But I'm very glad to hear the speaker said that we cannot allow Putin to win. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=142.52s)]
*  I think all of us, Ukrainians, but also Americans, on a very strong bipartisan basis understand [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=146.68s)]
*  that it's important for all of us. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  We cannot let aggressive, terroristic, non-democratic country to win, which just started a war of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=156.44s)]
*  choice with no provocation. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=165.36s)]
*  This is a violation of international law, but it's also a violation of principles on [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=167.24s)]
*  which America is built, the values of Americans, but also what we are trying to build our country [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=171.72s)]
*  on. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  So we have to win and America has to win in this one. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  Your president was on another network this morning and said that he still doesn't have [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=182.8s)]
*  any reason to believe Russia wants to negotiate a peaceful end to this conflict. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  Are there a lot of reports that there's pressure on your government to agree to some kind of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=192.28s)]
*  way to negotiate an end to the fighting? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=197.48s)]
*  Any movement? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=201.64s)]
*  Just the reports. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=202.64s)]
*  Russia never intended to negotiate. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=204.12s)]
*  They intend to destroy us. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=208.68s)]
*  And we see it on the battlefield and we see it in all the, if you can call them, diplomatic [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=210.48s)]
*  interactions of their ambassadors. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=215.44s)]
*  But no, their intent is very clear. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  They are bombing civilians. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  Just today they again bombed Odessa. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=223.96s)]
*  They are bombing our country everywhere. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=227.4s)]
*  They are preparing, of course, to bomb us even more during winter. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  And they are trying everything possible on the long front line to achieve some kind of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  military goal. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=239.12s)]
*  So that's not how people who want to actually negotiate peace act. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=240.12s)]
*  People who want to negotiate peace first stop their aggressive war, get out from our country [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=245.72s)]
*  and then negotiate. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=251.76s)]
*  So no, I don't think we should, let's not get fooled by any of the reports, whether [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=252.76s)]
*  they are on anonymous sources or even some Russian sources. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=259.8s)]
*  Your president has also talked about the need for more air defense because Russia has strengthened [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=265.16s)]
*  its abilities. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=269.68s)]
*  He said the F-16s, the U.S. promised, they won't arrive for a while, that Ukraine would [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=270.68s)]
*  like to borrow planes. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=274.96s)]
*  How would that work? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=276.76s)]
*  Is there some kind of immediate way to address this need? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=277.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, there are a number, like we are open for any ideas to cooperate. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=283.2s)]
*  So we're very grateful to American people for all the equipment that we are getting [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=288.44s)]
*  on these programs, you know, with your funding from your own stocks. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=293.56s)]
*  And we really again count on Congress to continue that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=298.32s)]
*  We are ready to rent or lease or use any other equipment, including the American equipment. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  It's not only from the U.S. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  We are ready to co-produce together. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=311.8s)]
*  It's one of the very important outcomes of the president's Zalensky visit to the U.S. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=313.68s)]
*  And we are working in that direction with American companies. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=318.48s)]
*  So we understand that we need much more to win now, but we also need to build our future [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=321.48s)]
*  force because even after we win, Russia is not going to disappear somewhere. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=328.56s)]
*  And they will continue to be a threat not only to us, but to the European Union, to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=332.96s)]
*  the U.S., to everyone, to the transatlantic community. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=337.32s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you for your time. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4TQsA0dE0U&t=341.56s)]
