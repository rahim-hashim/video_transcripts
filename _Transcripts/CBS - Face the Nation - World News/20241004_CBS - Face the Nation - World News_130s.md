# Iran will attack Israel again if necessary, supreme leader says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w)
*  Now to the Middle East, where Israel launched another series of missile strikes Friday against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=4.96s)]
*  In response to the growing crisis there, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the United [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=8.68s)]
*  States will provide nearly $157 million in humanitarian assistance. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=12.72s)]
*  Also, on Friday, Iran's supreme leader delivered remarks in Tehran, where he addressed the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=18.0s)]
*  missile attack on Israel. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=22.72s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent MTS Tayyab is in Beirut. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  MTS, what more did he have to say? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, gave essentially a rousing speech [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=29.88s)]
*  in front of this massive crowd in Tehran, where he led Friday prayers there for the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=35.56s)]
*  first time in nearly five years. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=40.56s)]
*  And at one point in his hand, you could see that he was holding the barrel of some sort [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=43.08s)]
*  of gun, some sort of weapon. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  And as he was speaking, he basically said to Israel that we have struck you once and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  we will strike you again. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=57.96s)]
*  Now, this, of course, follows Iran's massive ballistic missile attack that targeted Israel [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  on Tuesday. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=65.6s)]
*  Israel and the U.S. successfully managed to thwart that attack, but it really just underscores [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=67.68s)]
*  the tension that we've been seeing across the region, especially since Israel has really [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=73.72s)]
*  ramped up its violence across Lebanon, including here in the capital Beirut, where massive [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  explosions has targeted the southern suburbs. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=85.32s)]
*  Now, all of this has triggered a major humanitarian crisis and has also seen a number of Americans [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=88.56s)]
*  desperate to get out of the country. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  Now, we met a man by the name of Shania Jadhri. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=97.6s)]
*  He is an NYU grad student and a Marine Corps vet, and he has been trying to get in touch [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=101.08s)]
*  with the U.S. Embassy, but really has not been able to. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  Now, Jadhri says he still has no idea how he will get home as Israeli strikes across [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=110.76s)]
*  Lebanon only intensify. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=116.2s)]
*  So far, over 2,000 people have been killed in the attacks, a figure the U.N. is calling [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=118.68s)]
*  totally unacceptable. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  Lana. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=126.0s)]
*  MTS, Tyab and Beirut, thank you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QfYZMGU79w&t=127.0s)]
