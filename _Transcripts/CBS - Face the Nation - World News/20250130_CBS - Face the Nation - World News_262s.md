# Hamas releases 8 hostages, Israel criticizes the chaotic handover
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8)
*  Hamas has released eight more hostages as part of an ongoing ceasefire deal with Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=0.0s)]
*  But the messy handover is drawing criticism from Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=5.34s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is warning Hamas against endangering the hostages and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  violating the agreement. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=12.56s)]
*  CBS News reporter Haley Ott has the latest from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Chaos in Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=19.88s)]
*  As Israeli hostages, Arbel Yehud and Gadi Moses were handed over to the Red Cross. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=20.96s)]
*  Crushing crowds surrounded 29-year-old Yehud, who looked terrified as Hamas fighters moved [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=27.32s)]
*  her along. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=33.08s)]
*  Earlier Thursday, in another part of Gaza, 20-year-old Agam Berger, an Israeli soldier, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=34.08s)]
*  was set free. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=39.52s)]
*  It's the third time militants have let hostages go since a ceasefire took hold in the Gaza [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=41.2s)]
*  Strip earlier this month, and was a stark contrast to the slick choreography of previous [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=46.0s)]
*  releases. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  The frantic scene sparked outrage from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who ordered [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=53.48s)]
*  a delay in Thursday's Palestinian prisoner exchange. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  Hours later, more than 100 were turned over. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=62.36s)]
*  In Tel Aviv, Israelis celebrated the homecoming of more hostages. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=66.0s)]
*  But there was desperation for the return of the rest. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=70.8s)]
*  We need them all, the dead ones and the alive, hostages, everybody back. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  After 15 months of relentless war, long-awaited reunions like this offer a glimmer of hope [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=80.04s)]
*  for families still waiting. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=86.68s)]
*  Haliat, CBS News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=89.04s)]
*  John Alterman joins me now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=93.2s)]
*  He is a senior vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Center for [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=94.44000000000001s)]
*  Strategic and International Studies. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  John, could this chaotic handover jeopardize a ceasefire deal and future releases? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  What are the biggest concerns? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure that this handover jeopardizes it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=106.8s)]
*  It feels like they're certainly getting messier. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=109.36s)]
*  I think what's really going to start jeopardizing the deal is when there are no more live hostages [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=111.12s)]
*  to hand over and Israel is intended to release live Palestinians in exchange for some Israeli [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=116.0s)]
*  body bags. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=122.8s)]
*  And I think that when that starts to happen, if that starts to happen, and I'm not sure [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=124.12s)]
*  that it will, but if that starts to happen, I think the politics in Israel will turn very, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=128.4s)]
*  very dark about this exchange. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=132.64s)]
*  So that leads us to the second phase of the deal, which would need to extend and still [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=135.12s)]
*  needs to happen. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=140.68s)]
*  Do we have any idea of a timeline of when this phase ends and the next one could start? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=141.68s)]
*  Or are things too precarious at this juncture to even talk about that? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=145.96s)]
*  Well, they're intended to start negotiating the second phase of the deal on Monday. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=149.52s)]
*  And the first phase goes 42 days and it releases 33 hostages. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  As I say, whether all of those hostages are alive, I'm not sure. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=159.56s)]
*  This is for female soldiers and people not of military age and women who were not soldiers. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=164.84s)]
*  When you start getting to male soldiers, it's not even clear what the exchange would be. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=173.04s)]
*  That's going to be a very hard set of negotiations for Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=179.36s)]
*  As I say, I think when there's a sense that Palestinians are exchanging dead Israelis [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=182.84s)]
*  for live Palestinians, I think that the mood is going to change and become much darker. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=188.82s)]
*  The release envoy for the Trump administration visited Gaza Wednesday before meeting with [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=194.04s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=199.12s)]
*  What is the goal of that visit and what is the significance of Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=200.6s)]
*  said to be President Trump's first foreign dignitary to visit the White House in his [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=204.0s)]
*  second term? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=207.68s)]
*  Well, I think President Trump wants to take some victory in this, that this is moving. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=209.0s)]
*  There's no question that Steve Woodcock, the presidential envoy, is everybody wants to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=216.44s)]
*  talk to him. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=220.88s)]
*  The Qatari's want to talk to him, the Egyptians want to talk to him. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=222.72s)]
*  President Trump certainly has created a sense of momentum that wasn't there at all. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  Where this goes, if it goes in a constructive direction or not, a positive direction or [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=231.76s)]
*  not, I'm much less sure. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=236.44s)]
*  I'm not skeptical, but I'm just not sure where this is going to go. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=237.84s)]
*  Some of the decisions that people are talking about, I think a lot of people in the region [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=243.28s)]
*  think would be very disruptive. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=247.78s)]
*  I don't think are likely to come to fruition, but certainly there is a mood of negotiation [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  that wasn't there just a few weeks ago. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=256.12s)]
*  John Ultraman, thank you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Lindsay. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKlqbUXy3d8&t=259.71999999999997s)]
