# Sen. Chris Murphy says the civilian death toll in Gaza is a "boon" to terrorist organizations
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [May 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY)
*  And now by Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=3.48s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=4.32s)]
*  So I want to start here on the Middle East. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=5.14s)]
*  The president's national security advisor said, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=7.28s)]
*  so far Israel has been somewhat targeted and limited [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=9.6s)]
*  in what they're doing in Southern Gaza. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=13.16s)]
*  But the US is watching to see whether there's a lot of death [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  and destruction from this operation [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=18.38s)]
*  or if it is more precise and proportional. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=20.64s)]
*  Are you clear on what the red line is here? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=23.44s)]
*  Well, what we know is that there's a humanitarian disaster [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=26.96s)]
*  unfolding right now in and around Ra'a. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=29.84s)]
*  We have not been able to get in significant shipments [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=31.92s)]
*  of humanitarian aid. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=35.0s)]
*  And so no matter how many people are dying [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=36.24s)]
*  from Israeli military operations, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=38.92s)]
*  there are people dying every single day [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=41.12s)]
*  from an inability to access food and medicine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=43.64s)]
*  This is ultimately accruing to the benefit, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=47.36s)]
*  not the detriment of terrorist recruiting. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=50.16s)]
*  And that's my big worry here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=52.3s)]
*  There's a moral cost to the number of civilians [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=53.68s)]
*  that are dying inside of Gaza. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=56.68s)]
*  But when you continue to withhold food and aid [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=58.56s)]
*  from the people, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  that ultimately makes these terrorist causes stronger, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=63.64s)]
*  not just in Israel, but around the world. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  Our own intelligence experts have told us [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=68.78s)]
*  that this is having a generational impact on terrorism. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=70.38s)]
*  And so for many of us that want Israel [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=73.56s)]
*  to bring this military operation to a close [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=76.12s)]
*  and focus on the future political settlement inside Gaza, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  it is in part because we worry [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=82.64s)]
*  that this is a boon to terrorism, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=84.68s)]
*  to terrorism groups growing all around the world. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=87.68s)]
*  Right, but the National Security Advisor [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=89.36s)]
*  was suggesting there that the line hasn't been crossed yet. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=91.2s)]
*  We're looking at whether there's a lot of death [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=94.32s)]
*  and destruction. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=96.8s)]
*  There already is a heck of a lot of death and destruction. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=97.64s)]
*  Yes, which is why I am amongst many of my colleagues [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=99.52s)]
*  who have caused, who have called on Israel [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=102.84s)]
*  to pause military operations, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=104.76s)]
*  to try to get this humanitarian nightmare under control, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=106.52s)]
*  and to take the time to come up with a realistic solution [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=110.32s)]
*  for what Gaza looks like after the fighting stops. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=113.32s)]
*  What you have seen in the past few weeks [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  is that as Israel clears out of certain areas [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  like northern Gaza, Hamas is just filling back in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=121.32s)]
*  because there is no viable plan for governance. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=124.83999999999999s)]
*  Israel has to take the time to both be less cavalier [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=128.12s)]
*  about the humanitarian costs, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  but also come up with a plan for what Gaza looks like [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=132.72s)]
*  after the fighting stops, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=134.88s)]
*  and the fighting is going to stop at some point. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=135.84s)]
*  So I understand the intention behind building the pier, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=137.48s)]
*  but $320 million, three soldiers injured, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=141.06s)]
*  the thing is breaking apart because of rough seas. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=144.3s)]
*  It's insufficient to need, was it mistake to do this? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=148.38s)]
*  No, it wasn't a mistake. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's nothing that the United- [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=154.38s)]
*  It's not even fully being delivered. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  Listen, I think there'll be some rough moments [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=157.7s)]
*  in the early going of trying to get this pier operational, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=159.66s)]
*  but you are absolutely right, whether it's the airdrops [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=162.06s)]
*  or the deliveries on the pier, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=164.34s)]
*  there's nothing that the United States can do [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=165.9s)]
*  that will substitute for the decision by Israel [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=167.78s)]
*  to open up crossings, to stop using these checkpoints [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=170.62s)]
*  as a means to interrupt the flow of vital goods. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  Israel has to make a commitment [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=177.78s)]
*  to solve the humanitarian crisis inside Gaza. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=179.34s)]
*  The United States is not going to be able [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=182.3s)]
*  to do that for Israel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=183.58s)]
*  I want to ask you about here at home, the southern border. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=185.9s)]
*  Border patrol apprehensions of migrants [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=189.02s)]
*  actually has been going down in these warmer weather months. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=191.38s)]
*  They went down in April, they went down in March. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=194.62s)]
*  Is that just because of the Mexican government? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=197.3s)]
*  If it's a Biden policy, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=199.62s)]
*  why isn't the president claiming a success? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=200.86s)]
*  So it is because of, I think, smart, effective diplomacy [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=204.06s)]
*  between the United States and the Mexican government. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=207.3s)]
*  I don't know that it's permanent. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=210.1s)]
*  And so I think we have to just recognize [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  that without updating the laws of this country, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=215.06s)]
*  without surging more resources to the border, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  we can't count on the numbers staying as low [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=220.02s)]
*  as they are today. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  And remember, today you have about 3,000 people [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=223.82s)]
*  crossing at the border on a daily basis. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=226.3s)]
*  That's still a high number compared to what we saw [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=228.1s)]
*  10 years ago. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=230.54s)]
*  And so for many of us, we are just heartbroken. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=231.54s)]
*  We're sick over the fact that our Republican colleagues [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=234.1s)]
*  in Congress continue to vote against [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=236.1s)]
*  bipartisan border security that would give us [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=238.29999999999998s)]
*  the opportunity to actually give the president the resources [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=240.45999999999998s)]
*  and the authorities to make this a permanent change, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=243.22s)]
*  to get the numbers under control on a permanent basis. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=246.9s)]
*  You're talking about the bill you helped author, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=249.7s)]
*  and it was put up for a vote, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=251.66s)]
*  which they knew it was going to fail. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=253.26s)]
*  This was about messaging. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=256.06s)]
*  Like Senator Gary Peters, who's trying to help Democrats [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=257.54s)]
*  defend the majority in the Senate, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=260.58000000000004s)]
*  was on this program last week, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=262.18s)]
*  and he said absolutely the president should be talking [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=263.38s)]
*  about the border more. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=266.06s)]
*  Why isn't he? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=267.74s)]
*  So I agree that the American people want to talk [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=270.06s)]
*  about border security, and right now, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=274.82s)]
*  the president has the opportunity to go out there [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=277.26s)]
*  and talk about a Democratic Party proposal [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=279.42s)]
*  negotiated with Republicans [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  that would get the border under control. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=283.94s)]
*  And a opponent, president- [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=285.98s)]
*  Or could have spent months and weeks [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=287.70000000000005s)]
*  whipping support for it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=289.06s)]
*  And President Trump's desire to keep the border a mess [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=290.90000000000003s)]
*  because he thinks that it helps him politically. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=294.82s)]
*  This is as clear a contrast as has ever been available [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=296.86s)]
*  to the Democratic Party on the issue of the border. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=299.94s)]
*  Democrats support bipartisan border security. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=302.26s)]
*  Republicans want the border to be a mess [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=304.26s)]
*  because it's good politics for them. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=306.06s)]
*  And the president and every Democrat running for office [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=307.38s)]
*  should be talking about that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=309.70000000000005s)]
*  But you know, and we really dug in deep on this bill [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  that you helped author on this program, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=314.38s)]
*  but for Americans who just want something done, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=316.18s)]
*  you know, the ifs and buts really don't matter much. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=318.74s)]
*  The president could take executive action [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=321.42s)]
*  and has been talking about it since back in February [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=324.02s)]
*  when the Homeland Security Secretary [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=327.18s)]
*  mentioned it was being considered. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=329.42s)]
*  Should he just get caught trying, pull the trigger, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=331.9s)]
*  do something on executive action? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=334.02s)]
*  The president has such limited ability [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=335.86s)]
*  to issue executive orders [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=338.78s)]
*  that would have an impact on the border. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=342.26000000000005s)]
*  He can't conjure resources out of thin air. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=344.34000000000003s)]
*  If he were to try to shut down portions of the border, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=347.74s)]
*  the courts would throw that out, I think, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=350.82000000000005s)]
*  within a matter of weeks. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=352.5s)]
*  The only thing that will bring- [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=354.62s)]
*  The 212F authority that's being mauled here. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=356.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think the only thing that will bring order [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  to the Southwest border is bipartisan legislation. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=361.22s)]
*  We have a bipartisan border bill. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=364.18s)]
*  If Republicans decided to support it, it would pass. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=365.98s)]
*  We could get it to the president's desk. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=368.54s)]
*  It is up to Donald Trump and Republicans [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=369.90000000000003s)]
*  as to whether they want to solve the problem with the border [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=371.66s)]
*  or whether they want to keep the border a mess [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=373.74s)]
*  because it helps them politically in this upcoming election. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=375.66s)]
*  So quickly, before I let you go here, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=378.46s)]
*  there was a lawsuit that was brought this week [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=382.1s)]
*  by the families of those in Uvalde, Texas, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=385.42s)]
*  whose children died in Robb Elementary School. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=388.02s)]
*  And you represent Sandy Hook. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=390.82s)]
*  I know you follow this very closely. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=392.38s)]
*  They are trying to bring suit against video game makers [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=394.58s)]
*  and meta platforms, which owns Instagram. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=397.42s)]
*  What do you think of the premise of the idea [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=399.9s)]
*  that social media companies and video companies [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=402.38s)]
*  are to blame here? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=405.5s)]
*  Well, listen, there's no doubt that these social media companies [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=407.14s)]
*  are feeding violent content to our kids. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=411.38s)]
*  I don't know the underlying dynamics of that legal case, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=415.26s)]
*  but our social media companies have a lot to answer for [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=418.14s)]
*  because these would-be killers whose brains are breaking [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=420.97999999999996s)]
*  often find inspiration for the crime [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=423.97999999999996s)]
*  that they are contemplating online. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=426.38s)]
*  But the solution here, again, is the same. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=428.70000000000005s)]
*  You have to pass legislation. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=430.82000000000005s)]
*  The courts can't solve this problem of school shootings. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=432.06s)]
*  And the good news is that since we passed [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=434.70000000000005s)]
*  the Bipartisan Safe Communities Act [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=436.26000000000005s)]
*  right after Uvalde's shooting, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=437.70000000000005s)]
*  urban gun homicides in this country have dropped by 20%. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=439.78000000000003s)]
*  And that's something that's very, very important. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEjABgB1GdY&t=442.46000000000004s)]
