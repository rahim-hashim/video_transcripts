# Fiona Hill and Chris Krebs on the Griner-Bout prisoner exchange
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU)
*  Before we get to our next segment, a quick follow up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=0.0s)]
*  We asked the White House for a response to the Shargee family, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=2.64s)]
*  and a spokesperson said that they have offered a meeting with the president's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=5.28s)]
*  national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, and they're working on scheduling it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=8.8s)]
*  Turning now to national security, we want to welcome our panel of experts. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=13.44s)]
*  Former National Security Council Russia specialist Fiona Hill and Chris Krebs, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=16.96s)]
*  former cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency head and a CBS News analyst. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=20.88s)]
*  They both worked together during the Trump administration. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=25.44s)]
*  Good morning to you both. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  Morning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=29.76s)]
*  Fiona, there's so much to get to, but I want to ask about this prisoner swap. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=31.6s)]
*  Your former colleague, John Bolton, I think your former boss, right, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=36.72s)]
*  on the National Security Council, told one of my colleagues at CBS that the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=39.68s)]
*  possibility of a boot for whale and trade existed back then, and it wasn't made for very good reasons, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=44.32s)]
*  having to deal with Victor Boot. Do you recall a potential prisoner swap with Russia? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=50.64s)]
*  Yes, I do recall that. That was raised many times by the Russians that they wanted Victor Boot. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=55.92s)]
*  And at the time, there was also the drug smuggler Yaroshenko, who was ultimately swapped for Trevor [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=61.2s)]
*  Reid, the other former Marine. They were put on the table by the Russians, making it very clear [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=68.08s)]
*  that they had every intent of trying to swap Americans that had been wrongfully detained [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  for individuals in United States custody who were there for pretty good reasons. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Do you see something particularly dangerous about Victor Boot? I mean, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=83.36s)]
*  why was that swap turned down then, but it happened just this past week? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, look, at the particular time, I also have to say here that President Trump wasn't especially [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=93.04s)]
*  interested in engaging in that swap for also Paul Whelan. He was not particularly interested [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=99.76s)]
*  in Paul's case in the way that one would have thought he would be. Ambassador Bolton [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=106.72s)]
*  met with Elizabeth Whelan, Paul's sister. I was at that meeting as well. There was a lot of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=112.4s)]
*  attention being paid to this and trying to find ways of arranging Paul's release by all different [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=117.76s)]
*  parts of the U.S. government. But of course, there was a big debate about Victor Boot himself. I mean, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=124.48s)]
*  as we see now as well, the absurdity of the Russians asking for the release of a notorious [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=128.72s)]
*  arms dealer, as well as somebody who'd been convicted of large-scale narcotics smuggling, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=134.88s)]
*  in return for American citizens who had been either set up, in the case of Paul Whelan, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=140.0s)]
*  and later imprisoned, in the case of Trevor Reed and Brittany Greiner, for very minor infractions [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=145.36s)]
*  that would have been handled differently in different cases. It was clear that the Russians [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=152.96s)]
*  were looking to kind of set the United States up as well for just the kind of things that we're [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=156.64s)]
*  seeing now in terms of the roiling of our domestic politics, as Chairman Schiff talked about later. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=161.68s)]
*  This is all part of a political game for the Russian government. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=168.08s)]
*  That's what you have been talking about, Chris, that the spin around this that has really [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  electrified the political body in this country. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=178.0s)]
*  Putin's very much tapped into the culture wars here. He understands the various levers and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  divisions that exist in American society. Given the fact that Russia does not have a whole lot [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  going on, their military clearly is underperforming on the field in Ukraine. Economically, they are [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=191.84s)]
*  has been. This is one of the few areas that Putin still has influence and ability to shape [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  the global narratives. This is one of those things where I think Americans traveling, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=204.08s)]
*  and as broad as soon as you leave the United States, you have to be very mindful of how you [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=208.96s)]
*  may fit into these information battles back and forth. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=213.44s)]
*  It has become an attack point from Republicans, including the House Republican leader, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=218.08s)]
*  that this swap took place for a Marine veteran left behind. But, Fiona, you're making the point [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=224.72s)]
*  that that Marine veteran was left behind. He was captured during the Trump administration. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=230.48s)]
*  You're arguing this is just disingenuous outcry, essentially. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  Look, what we have to bear in mind, as in the previous segment brought to the fore, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  is we have a lot of American citizens who are being taken by other countries for political [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=243.44s)]
*  purposes. President Biden called it national emergency. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=249.27999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely right. And as Chris is saying, every single American citizen who travels abroad, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=251.2s)]
*  even look in allies and partner countries, if you get into trouble, there's only so much [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=256.8s)]
*  that the United States can government can do for you. And when it is a state like Russia or Iran [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=263.28s)]
*  or China or North Korea, I mean, some of them are more obvious than others. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=268.0s)]
*  You are putting yourself at a certain degree of risk, even if you think you were just basically [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=272.24s)]
*  going for the tourist purposes or to visit family or for something routine. Remember, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=276.96s)]
*  Trevor Reed was going to visit his girlfriend. Paul Willem was going to a wedding. And Brittany [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=281.44s)]
*  Griner was doing something that many other athletes do around the world, including Russian [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=286.23999999999995s)]
*  athletes here in the United States. If we think of a Vetchkin, for example, playing one of the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=290.64s)]
*  greatest hockey players here in the United States, playing for a Washington-based team. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=296.08s)]
*  They were doing something that seemed routine, seemed completely ordinary, but found themselves [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=301.76s)]
*  snarled up in basically political games. And we have to be mindful of the fact that when [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=306.56s)]
*  governments do this, they're doing it for trading purposes, but they're also doing it to mess about [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=311.92s)]
*  in our politics. And we are falling every single time for this. The more that we fight with each [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=316.56s)]
*  other, the more that we play into their hands. And we also risk other Americans being taken [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=320.72s)]
*  because it's a way of influencing our domestic politics. It's interesting you connect all those [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=325.52s)]
*  dots there. I know, Chris, you have been watching just the conversation we have with ourselves on [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=330.32s)]
*  social media and how inflamed it is. When it comes to some of these more extreme groups, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=336.0s)]
*  it's almost sometimes, it sounds absurd, and yet there are national security risks, as we saw in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=342.72s)]
*  Germany this week with this extraordinary arrest and attempted coup in Germany by people linked [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=348.4s)]
*  to QAnon. I mean, it doesn't sound real, but it is. Well, the QAnon piece, I think it's a reminder, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=354.96s)]
*  confirmation that QAnon is a global phenomenon that is catching on. And actually, I think in part [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=363.6s)]
*  what we're seeing now is that it's broadening and it's almost becoming mainstream. We have this [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  attempted coup in Germany. We have January 6th and the efforts to overturn the January 2020 election [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  that was Q adjacent as well. These things are catching on and they're informing much more [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  radical behaviors both at a national level and as a local level. And I think in part some of the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=389.52s)]
*  things that we're seeing with the attacks on the electrical grid, for instance, may not be Q, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  but they are extremists. They are online. They're white supremacist groups that are [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  pulling down and developing playbooks. And so there are national level efforts, but they're [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  also local level efforts. And a lot of this is just due to the broader information ecosystem [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=409.84s)]
*  and how virulent these conspiracy theories and efforts to overcome normal civil society. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=415.04s)]
*  The Homeland Security Secretary said that it did appear in North Carolina that attack was deliberate, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=423.44s)]
*  but it's early. Are you saying you believe there is evidence that it is tied to organized domestic [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=429.2s)]
*  extremists? So that I think is still a large question mark and the investigators are taking [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=434.08s)]
*  a look at. But the attack itself on that facility, that substation in Moore County, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=438.72s)]
*  was unquestionably deliberate. The tactics that the attackers used, multiple, two different [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=443.92s)]
*  substations, and then going in and targeting very specific critical equipment in that site, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=450.16s)]
*  there's no question that it was premeditated, that it was coordinated, it was deliberate. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  Combine that with the fact that there were half a dozen similar sorts of events in the Pacific [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=459.36s)]
*  Northwest. There have been events throughout the Southeast. So it says to me that there is [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=464.08s)]
*  something broader going on here and perhaps we are paying more attention now, but there is a [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=470.0s)]
*  significant threat to our nation's critical infrastructure. And right now, both the utility [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  operators as well as law enforcement, I think, are doing a hard look at what needs to change and how [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=482.32s)]
*  do we counter this threat? Fiona, when you were with us in October 2021, you said something that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=486.4s)]
*  stuck in my brain ever since, where you talked about the election cycles of 2022 and 2024 [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=492.88s)]
*  being potential vehicles for potential violence. And you called January 6th a dress rehearsal. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=499.36s)]
*  Are you as concerned now as you were then about the stability of the country? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=505.6s)]
*  I'm, let's just say, a bit more cautiously optimistic than I was back then. I mean, I think all [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=511.12s)]
*  alarms and red lights were flashing on every front for all of us at that particular juncture. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=517.44s)]
*  We've actually seen much more careful handling on every front of recent elections, including the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=522.7199999999999s)]
*  midterms, people being more circumspect about what's happening. Of course, we've got the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=527.68s)]
*  committee we just had Chairman Schiff on the program and the work that they're doing, which [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=533.3599999999999s)]
*  has, I think, played a very important role for a lot of Americans in sort of seeing how everything [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=538.4s)]
*  unfolded and people waking up to the risks of just so much acrimony in our politics. Now, it [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=542.64s)]
*  doesn't mean to say that we're out of the woods. And actually, as Chris is saying, we've got an [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=549.1999999999999s)]
*  awful lot of groups have been fired up by all of this. And they also take inspiration from [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=552.0s)]
*  international events. And so it isn't a coincidence, as we've been talking about, that you've had this [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=556.08s)]
*  coup attempt in Germany. And there are linkages among all of these events because there are [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=560.72s)]
*  certain groups that flow backwards and forwards and they link on the internet and they have [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=565.52s)]
*  personal direct connections. And so we are still in a dangerous time where we need to be vigilant [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=570.16s)]
*  and thinking about our resilience. Thank you for connecting all those dots for both of us. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=575.04s)]
*  We'll be back in a moment. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmm4yxKO0EU&t=581.44s)]
