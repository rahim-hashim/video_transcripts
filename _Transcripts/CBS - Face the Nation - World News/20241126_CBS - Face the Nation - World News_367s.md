# What to know about the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA)
*  We begin our report with a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon's Iran-backed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=0.0s)]
*  militant group Hezbollah. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=4.72s)]
*  After more than a year of fighting, President Biden said Tuesday both sides have accepted [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=6.32s)]
*  a U.S.-backed deal, which will be implemented with the help of France. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=11.36s)]
*  This has been the deadliest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in decades. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=16.52s)]
*  Lasting security for the people of Israel and Lebanon cannot be achieved only on the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=21.44s)]
*  battlefield. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=26.6s)]
*  And that's why I directed my team to work with the governments of Israel and Lebanon [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=28.040000000000003s)]
*  to forge a ceasefire, to bring a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to a close. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=33.44s)]
*  A full and permanent ceasefire will go into effect early Wednesday morning local time. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  The Israeli military will have 60 days to complete a gradual withdrawal from Lebanon. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  The first round of troops to leave the country will start within the next 10 days. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=50.6s)]
*  Hezbollah is expected to withdraw its forces and weapons about 20 miles back from the Israeli [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=54.92s)]
*  border. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=59.68s)]
*  Just hours before the ceasefire deal was announced, Israel and Hezbollah were still exchanging [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=60.68s)]
*  rocket fire. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=65.36s)]
*  The Lebanese Health Ministry says 55 people were killed by Israeli airstrikes in southern [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=66.56s)]
*  Beirut Tuesday, while Hezbollah strikes in northern Israel triggered air raid sirens. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=70.9s)]
*  Lebanon's Health Ministry says nearly 4,000 people have been killed since the war between [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=77.48s)]
*  Israel and Hezbollah began. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=81.84s)]
*  About 16,000 others have been wounded. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=84.08s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Debra Pata has the latest from East Jerusalem. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=86.36s)]
*  Debra? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=90.12s)]
*  The ceasefire has been approved by Israel's cabinet, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=91.12s)]
*  said Israel retains the right to strike back if Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=97.04s)]
*  to rearm. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=103.44s)]
*  The ceasefire will last 60 days, during which Israel will withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=104.86s)]
*  will retreat north of the Lethani River, with Lebanese troops and UN soldiers keeping [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=109.92s)]
*  the peace. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=115.28s)]
*  The implementation of the deal will be monitored by a five-nation committee, including the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=116.4s)]
*  US and France. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=121.56s)]
*  Just today, Israel hit 20 sites in Beirut in the space of just two minutes, aiming to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=123.68s)]
*  inflict maximum punishment in the final hours before the ceasefire takes hold. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=129.48s)]
*  Sirens sounded across northern Israel as Hezbollah launched many rocket attacks. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=136.04s)]
*  Most were intercepted. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  The two sides have been trading fire for over a year, but it exploded into all-out war over [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=143.22s)]
*  two months ago. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=149.17999999999998s)]
*  More than 3,750 people have been killed in Lebanon, over 100 in Israel. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=150.7s)]
*  For those caught up in this war, a ceasefire cannot come soon enough. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=157.76s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=163.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=164.88s)]
*  For more, let's bring in CBS News contributor Andrew Boyd. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=166.68s)]
*  He's the former chief of operations from the CIA's Counterterrorism Mission Center. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=169.44s)]
*  Andrew, if you can, peel back the curtain for us. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=173.52s)]
*  How is a deal like this brokered? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=176.12s)]
*  Good evening, Lindsay. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=179.6s)]
*  Well, I mean, with a lot of involvement from the Biden administration and with separate [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=180.6s)]
*  dialogue between the United States government and Israel about that right to strike back [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=185.88s)]
*  against Hezbollah if they violate the tenets of the truce. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=191.56s)]
*  But the basic guidelines for this ceasefire, this truce, is UN Resolution 1701 because [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=195.44s)]
*  Hezbollah, which was drafted after the 2006 war but never really adhered to, Hezbollah [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=201.84s)]
*  has to withdraw north of the Latani River, 20 miles north of the Israeli border, which [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  takes it out of the range of being a direct threat to the citizens of northern Israel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=213.88s)]
*  But the key, as your correspondent just noted, is that Hezbollah has to actually adhere to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=219.44s)]
*  this agreement and we'll see over the next 60 days if that is what they decide to do. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=224.28s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday there are three main reasons [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=230.24s)]
*  why he wants a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon to be able to focus on Iran, give [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=233.8s)]
*  their forces a break and to isolate Hamas. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=239.04s)]
*  Does Israel feel it's completed its intended goals against Hezbollah and what does it say [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=242.32s)]
*  that their troops and arms need replenishing? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=247.08s)]
*  So, I mean, I think any army with limited capacity needs to replenish their arms. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  So that is a good statement. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=255.44s)]
*  It's an important political statement for Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=257.48s)]
*  But they have achieved their goals. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=260.92s)]
*  I mean, this is a truce. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  This is a ceasefire. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=264.32s)]
*  It's an important step for the innocent civilians in Lebanon and Israel. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=265.32s)]
*  It's an important step so that Israeli citizens can move back to northern Israel, to their [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  homes. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=274.36s)]
*  But I really hesitate to really call it a truce or a ceasefire. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=275.2s)]
*  This is Hezbollah surrendering. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=279.88s)]
*  They have been defeated. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  They are no longer militarily relevant. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=282.36s)]
*  They have a terrorism arm that can that can conduct operations outside of the Lebanese [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  Israeli border area. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  And so we all have to be worried about that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=292.72s)]
*  And they also their their their sponsors in Iran may have something to say about terrorist [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=295.64s)]
*  operations. But as far as a military force. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=300.88s)]
*  And frankly, in a lot of ways, a political force in Lebanon, they have been defeated. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=303.64000000000004s)]
*  And this is Hezbollah surrendering. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=307.92s)]
*  Their leadership has been decimated. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  Many of their fighters have been killed. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  And we'll just see if the 60 day agreement holds. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=314.12s)]
*  But if it does, I think we're going to see Hezbollah return to focusing on social services, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  education to remain relevant in Lebanese politics. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=322.32000000000005s)]
*  Could this have any effect on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=325.92s)]
*  I mean, it could. The Iranians tried to link the two. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=330.44s)]
*  They're two very different, very distinct groups with very distinct goals. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=333.8s)]
*  Unfortunately, Hassan Nasrallah, unfortunate for him, he linked Hezbollah's future on [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  October 8th after the Hamas attacks on October 7th to Hamas, wherein Hezbollah would continue [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=343.96000000000004s)]
*  to fire rockets and missiles at Israel until there was a ceasefire with Hamas. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=350.52s)]
*  And that led to the demise of not only Hassan Nasrallah, but also Hezbollah. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=354.92s)]
*  But the entire leadership of Hezbollah. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=360.24s)]
*  Andrew Boyd, thank you so much. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=363.32s)]
*  Thank you, Lindsay. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zwzPQ8ttDA&t=365.68s)]
