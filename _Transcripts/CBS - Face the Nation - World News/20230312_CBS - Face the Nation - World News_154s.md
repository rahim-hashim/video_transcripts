**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [March 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4)
*  The resilience and strength of women around the world are cause for celebration, as we mark Women's History Month. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=0.0s)]
*  But despite the strides made in the last century, this moment may require a called action. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=7.0s)]
*  The reversal in women's rights is now officially a global emergency. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=13.0s)]
*  Progress, worn over decades, is vanishing before our eyes. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=18.0s)]
*  That backsliding, according to the UN chief, means gender equality is now 300 years away. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=24.0s)]
*  In Afghanistan, the Taliban's gender persecution may be a crime against humanity. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=31.0s)]
*  Women are virtually erased from public life. Girls are banned from attending school beyond sixth grade. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=36.0s)]
*  Iran's schoolgirls are allowed into the classroom, but hundreds have been mysteriously poisoned when they get there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=43.0s)]
*  The White House speculated it could be payback for protests against the regime, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=52.0s)]
*  which erupted after 22-year-old Masa Amini died in September after the so-called morality police detained her for showing her hair. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=57.0s)]
*  Viral videos like this one show schoolgirls daringly removing their head scarves in solidarity, inspiring women around the world. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=66.0s)]
*  Ukraine's women are stunningly strong, caring for and protecting their families while the men are at war. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=76.0s)]
*  Some taking up arms, others leading humanitarian efforts. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=83.0s)]
*  Yulia Pajewska spent three months in a Russian prison for evacuating women and children from besieged areas. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=88.0s)]

*  The rollback in reproductive rights complicates life further. So, too, does the skyrocketing cost of child care. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=107.0s)]
*  COVID pushed many female caregivers out of the workforce and in some areas of the world forced children into marriage. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=114.0s)]
*  There are some bright spots. The 118th Congress has more women than ever before, though that's only 29% of seats. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=122.0s)]
*  More women of color are running for office and more women sit on corporate boards. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=131.0s)]
*  Those symbolic wins inspire and should mean something to not let these setbacks stand or dissuade the next generation. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=137.0s)]
*  That refusal to give in, that type of resilience is worth celebrating. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=146.0s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4bzQsjAP4&t=152.0s)]
