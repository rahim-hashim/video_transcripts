# Lebanonâ€™s only burn unit inundated with victims amid Israel bombings
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8)
*  As we've been following the killing of Hamas leader Yaya Sinwar, our reporters on the ground have gotten a firsthand look at the civilian toll of Israel's multi-front conflict against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=0.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Deborah Pata went inside Lebanon's only burn unit. We want to warn you, some of the images in her report may be disturbing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=12.0s)]
*  This is what displaced Palestinians in a tent at camp in Gaza woke up to in the middle of the night. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=20.0s)]
*  A blazing inferno following an Israeli strike nearby, flames spreading furiously from tent to tent and only one fire extinguisher to douse them. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=30.0s)]
*  Residents scrambled to rescue people from the blaze but could not save young Shaban Aldalu who was burnt alive. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=43.0s)]
*  His father, Ahmed Aldalu, suffered agonizing burns in the same fire but it is guilt that's eating him alive. He was faced with an impossible choice. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=51.0s)]
*  I didn't know who to save, he told CBS News. I saw Shaban sitting up and although he was on fire, I thought he could get up and run. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=64.0s)]
*  So I rushed to rescue my youngest children. I thought everyone was safe. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=74.0s)]
*  Yesterday would have been Shaban's 20th birthday. Hospitals in Gaza are treating burned victims every day. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=80.0s)]
*  13-year-old Lian Hamadeen was trying to get food for her family when she was severely injured in another Israeli airstrike. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=89.0s)]
*  She just wants to be a teenage girl again. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=98.0s)]
*  I want the war to end, she said. I want to wear beautiful clothes and have beautiful hair again and I long for healthy foods like apples and mangoes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=102.0s)]
*  On Israel's second front, in its war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the death toll is also rising. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=119.0s)]
*  As Israeli jets continue to pound southern Lebanon, Hezbollah released this video vowing to strike deeper inside Israel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=126.0s)]
*  The Israeli military says it's targeting Hezbollah's strongholds. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=137.0s)]
*  But there have been over 2,000 casualties and nearly 11,000 wounded, many of them civilians. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=143.0s)]
*  At Lebanon's only burn unit, the hospital has tripled its usual number of beds. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=151.0s)]
*  In this ward, it even hurts to breathe. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=158.0s)]
*  Like any youngster, 11-year-old Hamadeen can't tear his eyes away from his phone. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=163.0s)]
*  It helps take his mind off the burn wounds that cover the one side of his body. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=169.0s)]
*  The phone is also a lifeline, his only connection to his mother, who's being treated in another hospital. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=175.0s)]
*  They were both injured in an Israeli strike. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=183.0s)]
*  Hamadeen doesn't know yet that his father and brother were killed in that attack. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=186.0s)]
*  His aunt Jamal Ebrahim is worried the news would be too much to bear. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=192.0s)]
*  He asked for his dad, his brother. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=197.0s)]
*  And you have not been able to tell him yet? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=202.0s)]
*  He's a little boy, 11 years, he make a shock. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=205.0s)]
*  It's the war's youngest victims that are particularly difficult for nurse Ali Humayda. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=211.0s)]
*  It's terrible to see children in pain, he told us, especially when there isn't much we can do. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=218.0s)]
*  Already, 21-month-old Ivana has learned to dread the men and women in blue scrubs. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=225.0s)]
*  I'm almost done, nurse Humayda reassures her. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=233.0s)]
*  She's covered in burns from head to toe. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=237.0s)]
*  The slightest touch is excruciating. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=240.0s)]
*  Her mother, Fatima Zayoun, told us their house was hit by a rocket over three weeks ago. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=244.0s)]
*  I saw my daughter on fire, she said. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=252.0s)]
*  Since then, she has been inconsolable. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=255.0s)]
*  I don't care about anything, she said. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=259.0s)]
*  I just want my daughter to get better. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=263.0s)]
*  The health system here is already taking strain as hospitals cope with a rising increase in patients injured in the war. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=267.0s)]
*  And doctors tell us they have no idea how they will cope if it gets any worse. Lindsay? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=275.0s)]
*  Deborah Pata, thank you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDxmnJAbb8&t=281.0s)]
