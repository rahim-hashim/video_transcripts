# Finland says it wants to join NATO as Ukraine takes back territory
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [May 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI)
*  We turn now to the war in Ukraine. Senior foreign correspondent Charlie Dagata has the latest on the diplomatic front and the battlefield. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=0.0s)]
*  Charlie? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=8.4s)]
*  Good morning Margaret. The Ukrainian government is claiming a key victory in the battle for Kharkiv and with Finland now on the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=9.72s)]
*  verge of joining NATO, President Vladimir Putin faces the prospect of sharing an 800-mile border with a NATO partner. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=17.66s)]
*  Finland today formalized its intention to apply for NATO membership with Sweden likely to follow suit in the days ahead. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=27.46s)]
*  We have today a historic day. Finland will maximize its security. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=35.1s)]
*  President Putin has already warned the Finnish president he's made a mistake in joining the alliance. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  It comes as Russia has faced significant losses pulling back from Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=51.419999999999995s)]
*  But the shelling continues. 67-year-old Vera Kosolopenko lost everything to a Russian missile. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=58.62s)]
*  This was my home she said and yesterday it was burned down. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=68.3s)]
*  Russia has now turned its firepower on eastern Ukraine's industrial Donbass region targeting infrastructure, bridges, oil refineries, warehouses. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=72.7s)]
*  But standing here looking at the size of this crater in the middle of a dirt road in a quiet residential neighborhood, it's hard to know exactly what the Russians were aiming for. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=82.7s)]
*  The sheer devastation caused by an air strike in Bakhmut that tore homes apart leaving residents homeless and furious. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=95.34s)]
*  We need help, a woman shouts in despair. Everything is destroyed, broken, salvaging what's left of their homes and their lives. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=105.34s)]
*  British military intelligence reports that despite that kind of bombardment, Russia has failed to achieve substantial territorial gains in the past month. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=117.98s)]
*  And it's likely Russia has lost around a third of the ground forces it committed to the invasion of Ukraine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=127.98s)]
*  Margaret? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  Charlie Dagata, thank you. We'll be right back. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucXrOTanuI&t=137.98000000000002s)]
