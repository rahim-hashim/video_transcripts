# Biden lifts restriction to allow Ukraine to fire U.S.-supplied missiles into Russia
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY)
*  So we begin this morning with a significant change to U.S. policy regarding the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=0.0s)]
*  A U.S. official has confirmed to CBS News President Biden has given authorization [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  for Kiev to use U.S.-supplied long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=10.8s)]
*  Now these weapons, known as the Army Tactical Missile System, can travel about 190 miles. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=17.36s)]
*  That would help stop Russian forces from attacking Ukrainian cities. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=23.04s)]
*  Responding to the news this morning, the Kremlin said this move by the Biden administration [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=26.88s)]
*  will further escalate tensions. And this comes as Russia launched a massive aerial attack on [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=32.24s)]
*  Ukraine over the weekend, described by Kiev as the largest it's seen in months. Russia fired 120 [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=38.16s)]
*  missiles and 90 drones targeting the country's energy grid. And overnight, a Russian missile hit [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=45.28s)]
*  a residential building. This is in Ukraine's northeastern city of Sumy, killing at least 11 [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=51.6s)]
*  people, and that includes two children. While at least eight people have been killed on a strike [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  this morning on Ukraine's port city of Odessa, Paul Adams, with our partners at BBC News, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=61.84s)]
*  says more on what Biden's decision could mean for Ukraine. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=67.6s)]
*  We understand that this will be used initially in aid of Ukrainian forces who are currently [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=71.92s)]
*  operating inside Russia, in the area of Russian territory in Kursk that they've been holding [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=79.44s)]
*  since August. That is important for them because they are anticipating a Russian counteroffensive [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=85.92s)]
*  in Kursk, assisted by as many as 10,000 North Korean troops any day now. And so the arrival [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  or the ability to use the attack on missiles to complicate Russia's planning will be important [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=99.84s)]
*  to the Ukrainians. Whether they are granted the permission to use it more widely in the future, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=107.68s)]
*  well, we'll have to see. We don't know how many of these systems they have, and we also don't know [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=113.28s)]
*  exactly what the Americans are saying in terms of what they can and can't do with them. It is also [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=118.4s)]
*  possible that Britain and France may follow Washington's lead and grant permission for [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=125.2s)]
*  Ukraine to use the Storm Shadow missile, also to hit targets deep inside Russia. None of these [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=130.64s)]
*  things in and of themselves can be regarded as game changers. They're not necessarily going to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=138.16s)]
*  change the course of the war in any emphatic way. But I think Ukrainian officials believe [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=142.55999999999997s)]
*  that it is a necessary step and one that will somewhat redress the balance of military might [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  at a time when they really feel they're on the receiving end of a slow grinding Russian advance [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  in the East and a feeling that Ukraine for the last several months has really been on the back [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  foot. Now, President Biden's decision to lift weapons restrictions for Ukraine comes as he's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  set to attend the G-20 summit in Brazil today. And guess who else is there? CBS News White House [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  reporter Willie James Inman, who joins us live from Rio de Janeiro this morning. Beautiful location [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=181.44s)]
*  to catch you at. So let's talk about this. How is the war in Ukraine now expected to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=186.56s)]
*  feature on this year's G-20 summit agenda? Hey there, Errol. A warm welcome to you from [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where the president is expected to attend those G-20 meetings. So look, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=199.04s)]
*  this communique, the statement that comes out and that's agreed to by all the G-20 countries, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=204.96s)]
*  will look a lot different than a statement or a communique that comes from the G7 nations. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=210.4s)]
*  Remember, the G7 nations are essentially aligned politically in terms of how they feel about the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  situation in Ukraine. But the G-20 includes Russia. Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=220.72s)]
*  is not here at the G-20, but still nonetheless, you have to get all these countries to agree [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=226.24s)]
*  to this communique that comes out of the summit. Perhaps there'll be a mention of Ukraine, but [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=231.84s)]
*  these nations just don't see eye to eye because not only are the U.S. allies, members of the G-20, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=236.0s)]
*  but also adversaries. And so that's certainly something that will be talked about behind the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=242.32s)]
*  scenes here at the G-20. But President Biden, the U.S. government, in making the support of those [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=246.96s)]
*  long-range missiles, proving them to be used into Russian territory, is certainly a change, a shift [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=252.24s)]
*  in things here on the world stage. But President Biden hasn't really said much. The White House [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=258.56s)]
*  hasn't really said much either. We just had a briefing with John Finer, the principal deputy, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=263.36s)]
*  national security adviser, who didn't confirm nor deny the situation with Ukraine. But clearly, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  the White House making this major policy shift while President Biden is on the world stage is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=274.56s)]
*  certainly something that other world leaders will have questions about and perhaps will talk to him [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  about later today. And rewinding the clock a bit, over the weekend, President Biden met with China's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=282.8s)]
*  Xi Jinping in Peru on the sidelines of the APEC summit, their final get together before an incoming [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  Biden administration. What can you tell us about their one-on-one? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=292.8s)]
*  Yeah, this was a high-stakes meeting, clearly the last time that President Biden will likely meet [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=298.56s)]
*  with President Xi or sit down with him at least before he leaves office. It's a meeting where [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=305.36s)]
*  they certainly don't agree on everything. But one area of agreement was that artificial intelligence [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=310.72s)]
*  should not be used to decide about the use of nuclear weapons, leaving that decision to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=315.92s)]
*  humans alone. That was a rare area of agreement between these two nations. Of course, there were [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=320.8s)]
*  conversations about trade, North Korea, and those soldiers being in Russia, being used by the Russians [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=325.04s)]
*  and North Korean soldiers. Clearly, the U.S. and China don't see eye to eye on everything. But [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=331.76s)]
*  a pivotal meeting, and one note I'll make before we leave you here from Rio, is that China, the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=336.16s)]
*  president of China, President Xi said that he will work with the incoming administration despite [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=342.48s)]
*  those trade tariffs that President-elect Trump has said that he would levy on the Chinese goods. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  Very interesting. All right, Willie James, Edmund, great to see you this morning. Thanks so much. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJDW4pA3EaY&t=352.8s)]
