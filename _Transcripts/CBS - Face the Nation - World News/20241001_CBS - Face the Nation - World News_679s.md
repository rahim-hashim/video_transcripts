# White House says Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles toward Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU)
*  But the White House has started its briefing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's listen to Jake Sullivan. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=2.0s)]
*  ... it occurred earlier today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=3.0s)]
*  I can take just a few questions because this is an ongoing situation and I need to get [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=4.72s)]
*  back to my desk. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=8.88s)]
*  Today Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=10.84s)]
*  The United States military coordinated closely with the Israeli defense forces to help defend [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=15.44s)]
*  Israel against this attack. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=20.88s)]
*  U.S. naval destroyers joined Israeli air defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=22.84s)]
*  inbound missiles. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=29.68s)]
*  President Biden and Vice President Harris monitored the attack and the response from [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=31.78s)]
*  the White House Situation Room, joined in person and remotely by their national security [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=36.24s)]
*  team. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  We are still working with the IDF and the authorities in Israel to assess the impact [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=41.96s)]
*  of the attack. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=46.68s)]
*  But at this time, and I stress at this time, we do not know of any deaths in Israel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  We are tracking the reported death of a Palestinian civilian in Jericho in the West Bank. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=53.86s)]
*  We do not know of any damage to aircraft or strategic military assets in Israel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=59.56s)]
*  In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=65.98s)]
*  and ineffective. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=70.72s)]
*  This was first and foremost the result of the professionalism of the IDF, but in no [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  small part because of the skilled work of the U.S. military and meticulous joint planning [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=76.72s)]
*  in anticipation of the attack. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=82.36s)]
*  We are also aware of reports of a terrorist attack in Jaffa that took the lives of a number [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=84.92s)]
*  of Israeli civilians and wounded several others today. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=89.6s)]
*  Our condolences go out to the families of the victims and to the family of the Palestinian [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  civilian in Jericho. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=97.56s)]
*  Obviously, my update here is based on early reports, and we reserve the right to amend [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=99.44s)]
*  and adjust as necessary as we gather more information. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=105.64s)]
*  The word fog of war was invented for a situation like this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=109.04s)]
*  This is a fluid situation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=112.16s)]
*  We will consult with the Israelis on next steps in terms of the response and how to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=114.14s)]
*  deal with what Iran has just done, and we will continue to monitor for further threats [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=120.6s)]
*  and attacks from Iran and its proxies. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=125.5s)]
*  We are particularly focused on protecting U.S. service members in the region. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=128.38s)]
*  And with that, I'll take just a few questions. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=132.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=134.18s)]
*  Thanks, Jay. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=135.18s)]
*  Is the administration making any preparations to evacuate U.S. citizens from Lebanon or [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=136.18s)]
*  elsewhere in the region? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=140.66s)]
*  We have been very clear for some time now that U.S. citizens should avail themselves [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=142.06s)]
*  of commercial means to depart Lebanon, given everything that's going on. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  We have said that from this podium, from multiple podiums. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=151.56s)]
*  We continue to say that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=154.06s)]
*  But we have not begun triggering a noncombat emergency evacuation, a NEO, and do not have [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=155.26s)]
*  an intention to do so at this time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=163.82s)]
*  If that changes, we'll let you know. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=165.58s)]
*  But we continue to reinforce the point. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=166.96s)]
*  citizens in Lebanon should follow the guidance from the State Department, which is to find [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=170.38000000000002s)]
*  civilian commercial means to depart, because in extremis, we may not be able to get them [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=175.66000000000003s)]
*  out safely. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=182.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=183.18s)]
*  Thanks, Jay. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=184.18s)]
*  What is the U.S. view on whether Israel should retaliate, and what is your concern about [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=185.18s)]
*  this leading to a wider escalation of war in the region? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=189.02s)]
*  We've had some initial discussions with the Israelis in the aftermath of this at the military [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=193.38000000000002s)]
*  and also at the White House to Prime Minister's Office level. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=199.2s)]
*  We'll continue those conversations in the hours ahead. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=202.8s)]
*  I'm not going to prejudge or get ahead of anything. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=205.12s)]
*  We want to have some deep consultations with the Israelis, and I'll have more to report [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=207.36s)]
*  to you after we get the opportunity for deeper discussions. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=210.84s)]
*  And escalation in the region? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=214.28s)]
*  Obviously, this is a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event, and it is equally [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=216.08s)]
*  significant that we were able to step up with Israel and create a situation in which [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=221.52s)]
*  no one was killed in this attack in Israel so far as we know at this time. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=227.16s)]
*  We are now going to look at what the appropriate next steps are to secure, first and foremost, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=231.32s)]
*  American interests and then to promote stability to the maximum extent possible as we go forward. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=236.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=241.04s)]
*  Back in April, the President's message to Israel was to take the win when the U.S. and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=242.04s)]
*  Israel were able to intercept the Barajah Iranian missiles. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=245.8s)]
*  Is he recommending a similarly limited response this time? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=249.28s)]
*  I will not, from this podium, share the President's recommendations. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=253.16s)]
*  He will have the opportunity to share them directly. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=257.28s)]
*  We're going to have, as I said, ongoing consultations with the Israelis this afternoon. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=259.44s)]
*  This evening, it is too early for me to tell you anything publicly in terms of our assessment [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=263.08s)]
*  or in terms of what our expectations are of the Israelis or the advice that we will give them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=268.12s)]
*  So will he be speaking to Prime Minister Netanyahu today? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=272.56s)]
*  I don't have anything to announce from this podium, but I can tell you that he is tracking [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  this minute by minute. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=279.44s)]
*  We are very much deeply in touch with the Israelis. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=280.68s)]
*  Insofar as we have calls to read out, we'll make sure to read them out with you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=283.72s)]
*  Just last question, then I'll turn it over. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=286.68s)]
*  Thank you, Jake. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  In April, after Iran struck Israel, the U.S. issued a number of sanctions as a consequence. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  This morning, the President said there would be severe consequences if Iran carried out [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=297.88s)]
*  this attack. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=301.76s)]
*  What are those consequences, and are they more severe than sanctions? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=302.76s)]
*  That answer will come based on the conversations and consultations we have with our Israeli [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=308.44s)]
*  counterparts. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=313.96s)]
*  It's too soon for me to stand before you today and give you an answer. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=314.96s)]
*  What I can tell you is this. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=317.8s)]
*  We are proud of the actions that we've taken alongside Israel to protect and defend Israel. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=319.8s)]
*  We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences for this attack, and we [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=324.38s)]
*  will work with Israel to make that the case. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=328.6s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=330.74s)]
*  Thank you, Jake. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=331.74s)]
*  Thank you, Jake. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=332.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=333.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=334.94s)]
*  On to the rest of the programming here. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=335.94s)]
*  This morning, President Biden was briefed by his Homeland Security Advisor, Lige Sherwood-Randall, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=339.94s)]
*  on the latest impacts of Hurricane Helene, and this afternoon he will receive an inter-agency [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=345.98s)]
*  briefing on the Hurricane Helene response and recovery efforts. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=351.3s)]
*  At the President's direction, the Biden-Harris administration continues to use every tool [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=356.34000000000003s)]
*  to get assistance and resources to the communities that need them the most. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=361.46s)]
*  Yesterday, the President approved a major disaster declaration for Georgia, which will [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=365.82s)]
*  unlock additional assistance to help those recovering. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=370.38s)]
*  This is in addition to the major disaster declaration swiftly approved by the President [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=374.98s)]
*  following requests from North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida, as well as requests [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  for emergency assistance across seven states. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=386.14s)]
*  Tomorrow, the President will travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he will visit the State [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=389.26s)]
*  Emergency Operations Center to meet with local officials and also first responders. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=393.54s)]
*  And the Vice President will travel to Augusta, Georgia tomorrow and will then head to North [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=399.62s)]
*  Carolina in the coming days. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=404.44s)]
*  As of today, thousands of personnel from across the federal workforce are deployed in supporting [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=407.3s)]
*  state-led Hurricane Helene response efforts across the six affected states, including [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=413.22s)]
*  over 1,200 personnel in North Carolina. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=418.74s)]
*  Still there is more work to be done, and the Biden-Harris administration will be there for [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=422.66s)]
*  these communities every step of the way. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=426.42s)]
*  Now, as you can see, we also have Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=429.94000000000005s)]
*  Thank you, Corinne, and good afternoon. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=437.70000000000005s)]
*  All right, we're pulling away from the White House press briefing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=439.62s)]
*  Corinne Jean-Pierre updating us on the recovery efforts after Hurricane Helene and the storm [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=441.90000000000003s)]
*  ravaged a large part of the South in the U.S. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=448.06s)]
*  And before that, we heard National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan give the latest information [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=450.58000000000004s)]
*  on Iran's attack against Israel. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=455.34000000000003s)]
*  Sam Vinograd is still with us and was speaking about kind of the national security perspective [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=458.70000000000005s)]
*  on all of this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=464.88000000000005s)]
*  I'm wondering, Sam, you've got some new reporting to share with us and also your response to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=465.88s)]
*  what Mr. Sullivan did and did not say. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=470.56s)]
*  Well, Mr. Sullivan did make some important comments about Iran's intentions here. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=473.4s)]
*  And based on conversations I've had as well, I think we have learned that Iran was trying [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=479.24s)]
*  to impact damage here. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=483.88s)]
*  Mr. Sullivan called this, I believe, the largest and most violent missile attack by Iran against [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=485.12s)]
*  Israel. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=490.28s)]
*  My sources have been sharing that Iran did intend to create significant damage against [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=492.04s)]
*  Israel, but they failed. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=498.1s)]
*  Why did they fail? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=499.38s)]
*  Because the United States and Israel together instituted a multilayered air defense system [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=500.8s)]
*  that prevented almost 200 Iranian missiles from causing damage. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=506.34000000000003s)]
*  Now, Mr. Sullivan did provide a note of caution and said that there's still assessments underway. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=511.88s)]
*  But at this time, it does appear that those 200 missiles did not lead to any fatalities, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=516.28s)]
*  which is incredible to think about. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=521.5999999999999s)]
*  But as we take a step back and think about what's next, Ariel, where does this go? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=523.5999999999999s)]
*  It does appear that Iran was not necessarily looking for an off-ramp. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=527.88s)]
*  They were not necessarily looking to stop the escalation in this conflict. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=531.5999999999999s)]
*  And that's an important data point as we think about what Israel's response might be. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=536.54s)]
*  Last time, after Iran launched aerial projectiles at Israel, Israel struck near to a nuclear [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=540.8s)]
*  facility in Iran. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=546.76s)]
*  This time, Iran around Israel may feel pressured to take bolder action based upon Iran's actions [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=548.52s)]
*  today, as well as Iran's ongoing support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=554.4s)]
*  others, Ariel. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=559.4s)]
*  Well, Sam, I want to connect that with something you mentioned before the White House press [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=560.4s)]
*  briefing that stood out to me, in which you had said the U.S. was communicating to the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=564.88s)]
*  Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that finding some type of resolution with [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=569.64s)]
*  Hamas, finding some type of off-ramp with Hezbollah is the preferred option. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=574.52s)]
*  And it appeared, based on what you were saying, that the Israeli prime minister was not listening. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=579.1999999999999s)]
*  Considering this was the largest, most violent attack against Israel, and it seems, based [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=583.88s)]
*  on this early information, that there were no fatalities, partly because of U.S. help, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=589.2399999999999s)]
*  does that change the calculation? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=594.16s)]
*  Is Netanyahu encouraged at all now to listen to the U.S. more? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=596.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, I think at the end of the day, the United States has dual objectives here. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=600.44s)]
*  In the first instance, the United States has a strong objective to ensure that Israel has [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=605.32s)]
*  both the right and the ability to defend itself. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=611.64s)]
*  The administration has been crystal clear on that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=614.44s)]
*  At the same time, the administration has assessed that a ceasefire and hostage release deal [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=616.76s)]
*  for Hamas, along with allowing humanitarian aid in, as well as a ceasefire in Lebanon, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=622.6s)]
*  would be in the best interests of Israel's security in the near term, as well as American [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=629.56s)]
*  and broader geopolitical dynamics around the world. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=634.84s)]
*  So for that reason, the United States has been urging diplomacy rather than military [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=637.92s)]
*  action by Israel. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=642.64s)]
*  But we should make no mistake that the president has been quite clear that Israel does have [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=644.4399999999999s)]
*  a right to defend itself. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=648.96s)]
*  And after Israel suffered yet another attack by Iran today, I think Mr. Sullivan hedged [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=650.28s)]
*  when it came to what should the Israeli response be. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=657.0s)]
*  He said, we'll engage in consultations and Iran will be punished. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=660.04s)]
*  He did not say Israel should, you know, to quote another U.S. official, take the win [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=663.8s)]
*  and take a step back. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=668.52s)]
*  He said there would be ongoing consultations, Errol. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=669.92s)]
*  Sam Vinograd joining us from our Washington bureau. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=672.52s)]
*  We really appreciate that up to the minute information you're providing with us. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lsL3tCfZkU&t=675.04s)]
