# Could Trumpâ€™s tariffs be the beginning of a trade war with China?
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q)
*  China announced retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. products Tuesday, shortly after the Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=0.0s)]
*  administration's 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports came into effect. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=5.28s)]
*  The tariffs are set to begin on Monday, February 10th. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=9.32s)]
*  As you can see, the highest of those target coal and liquefied natural gas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=12.38s)]
*  Beijing also announced it would launch an antitrust investigation into Google. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=16.76s)]
*  President Trump said he is in, quote, no rush to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=20.78s)]
*  despite earlier reports the two would speak today. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  U.S. tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada were also set to go into effect Tuesday, but [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=27.88s)]
*  that's paused for now for at least 30 days after leaders from both nations promised to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=33.04s)]
*  crack down on border security and drug trafficking. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=37.6s)]
*  CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady is here with us in studio. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=40.36s)]
*  So Kelly, some have speculated that this could be the beginning of a trade war with China. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=44.6s)]
*  If true, what would that mean? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=49.56s)]
*  So I would say that this is the first parting shots, if you will, the first battle. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=51.2s)]
*  Whether it turns into a trade war, we'll have to see. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=55.6s)]
*  But I do want to remind us all that we have seen the Biden administration and China also [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=58.68s)]
*  exchange barbs over the last few years. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=65.1s)]
*  So this is more of a continuation, just more the first part for this administration, this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=67.04s)]
*  new administration. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=70.64s)]
*  What that could mean, though, is really pain on both sides. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=71.94s)]
*  A trade war means higher prices for Americans, higher prices for Chinese companies and Chinese [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=74.92s)]
*  citizens. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=80.36s)]
*  A tougher time for American companies to sell their goods over there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=82.36s)]
*  I will highlight one big impact from the last trade war under the first Trump administration. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=85.52s)]
*  The agricultural industry lost $27 billion and farmers... [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=90.52s)]
*  The U.S. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=94.6s)]
*  agriculture industry who export to China. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=95.6s)]
*  Yes, because China said, you know what, we're slapping retaliatory tariffs on, we're not [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=97.4s)]
*  going to buy your corn, we're not going to buy your soybean. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=100.64s)]
*  And the U.S. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=103.24s)]
*  government had to provide a lot of aid for those farmers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=104.24s)]
*  So that's just one example of something that we could see happening. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=106.28s)]
*  Is agriculture something that's been targeted yet or that's potential? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=108.64s)]
*  That's what you're watching for. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=111.28s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=112.28s)]
*  That's a big one that we're watching. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=113.28s)]
*  They did target farming equipment, but that's different. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=114.28s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about the two sides then. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=116.4s)]
*  How big of an impact will this have on U.S. businesses and consumers that import and use [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=118.16s)]
*  Chinese products, but also on the flip side, how will this impact American businesses that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=123.84s)]
*  export to China? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=128.28s)]
*  Okay, so let's... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=129.28s)]
*  Because of retaliatory tariffs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=130.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=131.28s)]
*  Let's start with the imports. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=132.28s)]
*  You're going to see higher prices. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=133.28s)]
*  It is only a 10% tariff. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=134.28s)]
*  We were originally looking at something like a 60 or 100% tariff. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=136.64s)]
*  As a consumer, going to see a price increase, but not that full 10% because the company [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=141.28s)]
*  may decide to carry some of that on their own books versus pass it fully down to us. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=146.36s)]
*  For these companies, they now have to decide, should they try and source other places? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=151.6s)]
*  Should they try and build manufacturing capabilities there? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=155.96s)]
*  A lot of decisions to be made. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=158.16s)]
*  You also asked about the companies that sell to China. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=159.64s)]
*  The retaliatory tariffs that were put on today, I would not say that they have much bite, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=164.68s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=169.48s)]
*  They targeted industries that the US doesn't sell a lot. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=170.72s)]
*  We don't sell a ton of crude oil to China. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=174.16s)]
*  I'm not saying nothing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=176.64s)]
*  We don't sell a ton of farming equipment. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=177.64s)]
*  What we're feeling from the analysts that I've been talking to is China wanted to strike [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=180.28s)]
*  back, but also realize they are in an economically tough situation on their own end and they [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=183.68s)]
*  didn't want to raise prices a ton for their consumers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=188.84s)]
*  How is the stock market reacting? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=192.68s)]
*  We always finish with that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=193.84s)]
*  We know the stock market is not the economy, but something you still track. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=195.52s)]
*  It was up today. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=199.68s)]
*  NASDAQ, not so much. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=200.68s)]
*  That was more of an earnings thing, so we'll put that over there. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=202.32s)]
*  Investors saw the retaliatory tariffs were not that bad and we don't have those Canadian [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=205.72s)]
*  Mexican ones yet and they're happy about that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=210.32s)]
*  What are you watching for next? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=212.08s)]
*  What does the US... [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=214.56s)]
*  Is Trump and Xi going to talk? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=215.56s)]
*  That's a big one. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=217.44s)]
*  What happens in 30 days with those Canadian Mexican ones? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=219.08s)]
*  Kelly O'Grady, thank you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxS-2MPm70Q&t=221.72s)]
