# Taiwanese Rep. to the U.S. Bi-khim Hsiao | Full interview
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0)
*  Representative Chao, thank you so much for coming here today to talk to us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=0.0s)]
*  It's an intense week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=4.78s)]
*  Speaker Pelosi is the highest ranking U.S. official to visit Taiwan in about 25 years. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=6.66s)]
*  Why is Beijing so furious? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=11.6s)]
*  Well, there's no reason for them to be so furious. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=13.84s)]
*  We have had decades of welcoming congressional delegations to Taiwan, and this has been a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=17.68s)]
*  norm in our culture. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=24.92s)]
*  The Taiwanese people are warm and hospitable. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=27.28s)]
*  We're visiting friends is part of our tradition. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=30.12s)]
*  And actually one of the most quoted Confucian analytics in Taiwan is, isn't it a pleasure [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=34.04s)]
*  to welcome friends from afar? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=42.0s)]
*  And so having this as part of the norm of our engagement with the United States codified [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  in a strong foundation of the Taiwan Relations Act, there's really no reason for them to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=49.96s)]
*  be so upset. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=55.16s)]
*  The U.S. was concerned about this trip. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=57.32s)]
*  President Biden indicated the military wasn't enthusiastic about Speaker Pelosi visiting. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=59.72s)]
*  She spoke openly about the risk of her plane being shot down. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=66.6s)]
*  Did Taiwan ever have that level of concern that there was a risk here? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=70.44s)]
*  Well, we have been living under the threat from China for decades. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  And we cannot let their ongoing threats define our desire to make friends internationally. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=84.2s)]
*  If you have a kid being bullied at school, you don't say you don't go to school. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=93.68s)]
*  You try to find a way to deal with the bully. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=98.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what Taiwan is doing, working on making our society stronger and more resilient, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=102.28s)]
*  fortifying our defenses so that we have means of managing risks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=108.88s)]
*  The risks are not posed by Taiwan, nor are they posed by the United States. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=113.76s)]
*  The risks are posed by Beijing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  What specifically is that risk? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=121.4s)]
*  Is it a full-scale invasion? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=123.56s)]
*  Well, the Chinese have not renounced the use of force. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=125.2s)]
*  While we call on them to engage in dialogue for a peaceful resolution, they have been [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  intensifying threats towards Taiwan. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=137.68s)]
*  That is not only on a military level. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=141.32s)]
*  It has involved a hybrid toolkit of public disinformation, cyber attacks, economic coercion. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  They have a broad toolkit that we have become more and more accustomed to. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=153.6s)]
*  But again, that is not going to change our determination to defend our freedom. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=158.56s)]
*  What's happening right now is unprecedented. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=167.04s)]
*  Beijing has sent 68 warplanes, 13 warships right off your coast. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=170.72s)]
*  China has encircled Taiwan with these missiles. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=175.6s)]
*  It has fired off, even though they landed in the middle of the water. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=178.24s)]
*  Do you believe that this is just a drill? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, indeed, China's behavior is unprecedented. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=185.56s)]
*  And from the scope and the actions, it appears that they have been preparing for this for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=189.48s)]
*  some time, way before Speaker Pelosi decided to visit Taiwan. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=198.16s)]
*  From our perspective, again, my president has called on the Chinese government to exercise [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=205.28s)]
*  restraint. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  We intend to resolve our political differences through dialogue. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=214.24s)]
*  And that is the only way that will preserve the stability of the region. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=218.84s)]
*  It is the only way that will protect the interests of not only Taiwan and not only China, but [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=224.04s)]
*  the whole world. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=229.92s)]
*  Is this a test run for an invasion? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=230.92s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to speak for the Chinese intentions, but I am going to speak for what [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  we are prepared to do. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=240.44s)]
*  And that is we will not escalate. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=242.54s)]
*  We will not provoke. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  We are committed to maintaining the status quo. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=248.2s)]
*  We also call on China to act with restraint in the shared interest of stability in the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=252.3s)]
*  region that has worked for all stakeholders in the region. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=259.94s)]
*  China is seemingly showing that it can blockade Taiwan, that it can cut you off from the rest [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=266.02000000000004s)]
*  of the world. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=272.82s)]
*  What is the cost of doing something like that? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=274.1s)]
*  Well, China has been building up their military capacities rapidly over recent years. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=277.26s)]
*  And what they are doing through these exercises has the potential of jeopardizing some of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=284.65999999999997s)]
*  the most important air and sea commercial routes. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  And that will not only jeopardize, of course, Taiwan's security, the regional stability, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=297.05999999999995s)]
*  I believe they will also jeopardize China's interest in a stable environment under which [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=303.18s)]
*  trade and commerce can function. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=309.26s)]
*  And of course, there will be implications for the world. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  Such risky and dangerous behavior has implications for the world. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=314.58s)]
*  Do you believe that President Biden would militarily defend Taiwan against an invasion? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=318.5s)]
*  Well, we have a very strong security partnership with the United States. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=325.06s)]
*  Since 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act has provided a strong foundation for that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  For your self-defense and selling of U.S.-made weapons. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=335.7s)]
*  But it doesn't explicitly say the U.S. would come to your defense. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=338.94s)]
*  Well, we believe we must be determined to defend ourselves for others to be willing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=343.46s)]
*  to help us. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=353.41999999999996s)]
*  Do you have any assurances from the Biden White House that they would defend you? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  Not just sell you weapons as presidents have for the past 40 years, but actually come to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=361.17999999999995s)]
*  your defense? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=366.5s)]
*  Well, our security partnership is based on the Taiwan Relations Act and the six assurances. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=367.5s)]
*  And the contingencies or circumstances are hypothetical. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=373.02s)]
*  But what I can say is that we have a very strong security partnership that ensures the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=377.78s)]
*  protection of our shared interests in the regional peace and stability. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=382.82s)]
*  Taiwan's defense minister said just last year that China would have the capability [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=388.94s)]
*  to launch an invasion by 2025. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=393.78s)]
*  Are you ready for what may be coming? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=398.06s)]
*  Well the way we see the threat, it involves two parts. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=402.21999999999997s)]
*  Capabilities and intentions. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=406.42s)]
*  We work on intentions by communicating reason and rationality. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=409.04s)]
*  And we deal with capabilities by also fortifying our own deterrences. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=415.40000000000003s)]
*  And that is why Taiwan is also investing in our asymmetrical defense capabilities. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=420.32s)]
*  We do not intend nor are we able to engage in an arms race with China, but we are going [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  to be smart and asymmetrical about our own capabilities. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=432.34000000000003s)]
*  And that ultimately, in cooperation with other stakeholders in the region, is to deter an [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=436.92s)]
*  actual invasion from happening. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  Do you believe the timeline for an invasion is moving up? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=448.28000000000003s)]
*  The criticism of what Speaker Pelosi did by visiting is that she is provoking China. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think the word provocation has only one place, and that's with China right now. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=457.20000000000005s)]
*  They are the ones that are provoking regional instability. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=463.26s)]
*  And what we are going to do is try to ensure we continue to live under an environment in [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=467.62s)]
*  which the Taiwanese people can freely determine our future and also where we can define who [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=473.74s)]
*  our friends are. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=480.26s)]
*  And again, being warm and hospitable, welcoming friends from afar is part of our cultural [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=481.82s)]
*  tradition. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=487.94s)]
*  So you do not think that this was a mistake and that this visit has backfired? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=489.16s)]
*  Well, the visit has been welcomed by the Taiwanese people. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=494.44s)]
*  Sometimes it's hard for other countries from afar to fully understand the feelings and [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=500.04s)]
*  perspectives of the Taiwanese people. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=505.34000000000003s)]
*  And that is for too long. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=508.3s)]
*  We have been bullied, isolated, and suppressed and banned from international organizations. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=510.8s)]
*  Even though we have built a modern, open, prosperous democracy. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=518.66s)]
*  And so when friends come from afar and wish to lend their support to Taiwan, we generally [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=525.88s)]
*  take that with gratitude. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=531.88s)]
*  A number of high-level Republicans have also visited Taiwan recently, and former Trump [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=533.64s)]
*  Defense Secretary Mark Esper was just in Taipei. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=538.12s)]
*  He said that your government needs to have a greater sense of urgency to make your democracy [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=541.24s)]
*  thrive. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=547.0600000000001s)]
*  He said the U.S. assistance isn't enough to deter China over the long haul. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=548.74s)]
*  What do you need to do that? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=553.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, we are working on multiple fronts in terms of fortifying our own defenses, including [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=555.86s)]
*  the asymmetric capabilities that I spoke of. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=562.5s)]
*  Well there are multiple areas in weapons, in systems, in our domestic defense industry, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=566.0200000000001s)]
*  in our foreign military sales projects with the United States. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=571.48s)]
*  We are also working rapidly on reserve reform and finding ways to better integrate civilian [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=575.98s)]
*  resources in our homeland defense. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=581.94s)]
*  We're fortifying our cyber defenses. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=584.14s)]
*  We're also making our society more resilient to the political, psychological warfare of [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=586.38s)]
*  disinformation and other political levels of China's attempt at coercion in weakening [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=591.86s)]
*  our resolve to defend ourselves and our democracy. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=600.34s)]
*  The Pentagon says that it is a national security imperative for America to wean itself off [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=604.02s)]
*  of its reliance on Taiwan, specifically the computer chips that your country makes. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=609.84s)]
*  Ninety percent of high-end advanced products rely on your chips, particularly the U.S. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=615.56s)]
*  defense sector is incredibly reliant on Taiwan. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=623.4s)]
*  Are you concerned that as the U.S. weans itself off, that it won't be as willing to defend [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=627.06s)]
*  you? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=631.92s)]
*  Well the reason why Taiwan supplies over 90 percent of the advanced semiconductor chips [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=632.92s)]
*  is because we have spent decades in creating a comprehensive ecosystem that supports the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=638.36s)]
*  effective and efficient production of those chips. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=644.8399999999999s)]
*  And that model is not easily replicated anywhere else in the world. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=648.42s)]
*  Taiwanese companies are expanding their cooperation. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=653.12s)]
*  They are not moving out. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=655.74s)]
*  Rather they are expanding their presence in other parts of the world, including in the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=657.0s)]
*  United States. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=662.22s)]
*  The Chips Act does help to facilitate that and expedite that in terms of expanding production [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=663.62s)]
*  and fabrication here in the United States. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=670.5s)]
*  But Taiwan does maintain our edge. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=673.28s)]
*  And as much as the United States and others find that there is a dependency on advanced [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=675.98s)]
*  chips in Taiwan, I think China also has that same dependency. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=683.9399999999999s)]
*  In Taiwan it's paramount that we maintain our strategic relevance, whether it is economically [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=690.3000000000001s)]
*  or in our technology or in our front line stand in defending the core values that are [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=701.58s)]
*  so important to so many countries around the world, and that is in freedom and democracy. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=710.74s)]
*  President Biden is about to sign a bill that will pump 52 billion U.S. taxpayer dollars [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=716.9s)]
*  into semiconductors to try to protect America against the risk of a Chinese invasion of [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=722.9399999999999s)]
*  Taiwan. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=729.26s)]
*  The United States is planning in the eventuality that this is going to happen. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=731.4399999999999s)]
*  Is it inevitable? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=737.12s)]
*  Well there will be a growing demand for chips. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=739.12s)]
*  In the auto industry, other technology industries, there will be a growing demand. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=744.9399999999999s)]
*  So you don't see this as a sign that the U.S. is going to be less reliant and therefore [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=748.9399999999999s)]
*  less reliable? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=754.8199999999999s)]
*  I have seen during COVID-19 the disruption of supply chains and the pains in some industry [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=757.54s)]
*  sectors when there are those disruptions. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=764.9799999999999s)]
*  And I think it is smart that democracies are addressing supply chain security issues and [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=767.86s)]
*  Taiwan will be that reliable partner in addressing these supply chain challenges together with [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=773.0s)]
*  other reliable democracies. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=779.12s)]
*  You know one of the things when you talk to when you talk to Biden administration officials, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=781.9200000000001s)]
*  they will say Xi Jinping, the president of China, is taking notes. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=787.1600000000001s)]
*  He is watching what Vladimir Putin is doing right now in Ukraine as a test case to see [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=792.1s)]
*  what he can get away with in Taiwan. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=797.72s)]
*  What lesson do you think he is learning right now? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=801.96s)]
*  Well again I can't speak for his psychology at the moment or his personal analysis, but [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=804.46s)]
*  I think we are all learning lessons and the Taiwanese people are also learning lessons. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=812.3000000000001s)]
*  And we are learning that we have to be better prepared. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=817.94s)]
*  We have to be stronger in our own self defenses. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=821.6s)]
*  We have to work hard to galvanize international support in working to deter that tragic scenario [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=825.76s)]
*  from ever happening. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=836.04s)]
*  Are you concerned that the West won't stand by Taiwan the way it has stood by Ukraine? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=838.1s)]
*  China is financially so powerful it would be hard for the West to cut it off. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=845.8s)]
*  Well I think that was one of the messages that Speaker Pelosi was trying to convey. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=853.12s)]
*  And that is, despite all challenges, we have friends in the international community who [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=859.0799999999999s)]
*  will stand with us. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=865.9599999999999s)]
*  And lastly, China has also flexed its diplomatic muscles. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=868.38s)]
*  It cut off a number of agreements, it says, with the United States because of this visit, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=872.02s)]
*  including collaboration on climate change. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=877.3399999999999s)]
*  With China pulling out there, are you concerned that the West will look at this and say, it's [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=881.32s)]
*  not worth it? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=887.84s)]
*  Not just on climate change, but on other priorities that outrank Taiwan? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=889.2600000000001s)]
*  Well are we concerned? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=895.32s)]
*  Yes we are concerned about the disruption of these very important discussions on global [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=897.22s)]
*  issues that are matters of interest to not only the United States, but to China and everyone [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=902.36s)]
*  in the world. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=909.0s)]
*  The fact is, again, congressional visits to Taiwan have been ongoing for decades. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=911.36s)]
*  And for decades it hasn't prevented the United States and China from having constructive [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=918.92s)]
*  discussions on matters of mutual interest. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=924.04s)]
*  And I agree with some of the U.S., White House, and other statements and the analyses that [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=927.76s)]
*  The Beijing government is currently trying to manufacture a crisis over a practice that [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=938.36s)]
*  has been ongoing for decades. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=945.6400000000001s)]
*  And they are using this as a pretext. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think we have to make that clear. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=952.0s)]
*  If China is to evolve as a responsible stakeholder in the global community, it's really up to [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=955.08s)]
*  Beijing to decide if their rejuvenation, if China's rejuvenation will evolve with international [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=963.64s)]
*  respect or with international condemnation. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=971.88s)]
*  Representative, thank you for your time today. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=975.7199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzwlkDHpt0&t=978.4799999999999s)]
