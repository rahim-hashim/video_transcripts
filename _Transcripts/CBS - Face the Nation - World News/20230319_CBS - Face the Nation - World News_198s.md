Video Description: The U.S. aerial bombardment of Iraq began on March 19, 2003, a campaign that then-President George W. Bush described as "shock and awe." The takedown of Saddam Hussein's regime triggered a savage insurgency and brutal sectarian conflict, and led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and nearly 4,500 U.S. military personnel.

# Baghdad on the 20th anniversary of "shock and awe"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [March 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY)
*  We mark the 20th anniversary of the beginning of the war in Iraq. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=0.0s)]
*  It took just under seven weeks to wrap up the initial military operations, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=5.0s)]
*  but the last American combat troops did not leave Iraq until nearly nine years later, in December 2011. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=10.0s)]
*  Vice President Dick Cheney joined the broadcast just before the invasion, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=17.0s)]
*  and Bob Schieffer asked him how long he expected the war to last. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=22.0s)]
*  And I think it will go relatively quickly. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=26.0s)]
*  Weeks? Months? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=29.0s)]
*  Weeks rather than months. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=31.0s)]
*  There's always the possibility of complications that you can't anticipate, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=34.0s)]
*  but I have great confidence in our troops. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=38.0s)]
*  The really challenging part of it to some extent may come in the aftermath, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=41.0s)]
*  once the military segment is over and we move to trying to stand up a new government [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=46.0s)]
*  and turn over to the Iraqi people. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=51.0s)]
*  Our Charlie Daggett was in Iraq for CBS News when the war began. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=54.0s)]
*  He went back to bring us this report. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=58.0s)]
*  Shock and awe. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=61.0s)]
*  The U.S. military's term and intent for the aerial bombardment that began the war. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=64.0s)]
*  But the takedown of Saddam Hussein's regime triggered a savage insurgency and a brutal sectarian conflict. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=71.0s)]
*  A tragedy that cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and nearly 4,500 U.S. service members. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=78.0s)]
*  This is Baghdad today. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=87.0s)]
*  Gone are most of the cement blast walls and barbed wire. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=89.0s)]
*  Amid the capital's bustling marketplaces and cafes, something else has returned. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=94.0s)]
*  A sense of optimism. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=100.0s)]
*  But threats to Iraq's security remain. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=102.0s)]
*  Not least from its powerful neighbor, Iran, which continues to increase its influence. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=106.0s)]
*  With political parties and powerful paramilitary groups tied to Tehran. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=112.0s)]
*  All across Baghdad you'll find billboards and banners like this honoring the memory of Qasem Soleimani, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=118.0s)]
*  the top Iranian general accused of killing hundreds of American soldiers during the war [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=125.0s)]
*  and considered such a threat. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=131.0s)]
*  He was killed in a U.S. airstrike here in the city in 2020. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=133.0s)]
*  We put the question to U.S. Ambassador Alina Romanowski, who's visiting Washington, D.C. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=138.0s)]
*  But Iran has proven in the past to make this a very difficult place to operate in. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=143.0s)]
*  The Iranians have made it a difficult place to operate and have contributed to some of the insecurity, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=148.0s)]
*  but I do think that this is a sovereign decision that the Iraqis need to sort out with their neighbor. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=154.0s)]
*  There is a lot to sort out. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=162.0s)]
*  Iraq is recovering from decades of war and sanctions and widespread corruption continues to plague the economy [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=164.0s)]
*  despite booming oil revenues. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=171.0s)]
*  But Ambassador Romanowski believes Iraqi leadership has turned a corner. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=173.0s)]
*  I think you have a government that is committed to improving the lives and the services for Iraqi people. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=179.0s)]
*  Iraqis tell us what they want most is for this fragile peace to remain and hope the prosperity will come. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36gnOcpTKY&t=185.0s)]
