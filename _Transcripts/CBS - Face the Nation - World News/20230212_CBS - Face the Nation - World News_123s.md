*  We find ourselves in yet another moment where global crises seem to be converging, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=0.0s)]
*  and yet another reminder for us about how to put it all into perspective. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Four times in the past eight days, U.S. fighter jets scrambled to take out perceived threats [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=10.96s)]
*  tens of thousands of feet above North America. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=16.48s)]
*  That is a key kill. The balloon is completely destroyed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=19.28s)]
*  The spy balloon and aerial objects are a dramatic wake-up call that the U.S. isn't quite as [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=23.04s)]
*  insulated or as isolated as many like to think. Record-level migration was already an unmistakable [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=28.8s)]
*  sign that failing governments, dramatic climate shifts, and economic strain thousands of miles away [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  eventually end up on America's doorstep. As President Biden pointed out Friday, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=42.88s)]
*  the two biggest democracies in the Americas both recently withstood [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=48.16s)]
*  insurrection staged by far-right mobs. Both the United States and Brazil [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  democracy prevailed. Democracy also feels under strain in Israel where tens of thousands took to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=57.52s)]
*  the streets Saturday to protest against their new right-wing government. Meanwhile, Ukraine's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=64.0s)]
*  democracy continues its year-long battle to survive Vladimir Putin's brutal onslaught. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=69.76s)]
*  NATO warned last week that China is expanding its nuclear arsenal and so is North Korea. Kim Jong-un [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=76.16s)]
*  paraded a dozen intercontinental ballistic missiles down Pyongyang streets Wednesday. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=82.4s)]
*  And if the food and migration crisis in drought-stricken East Africa wasn't already [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  a sign of Mother Nature's power, she sent us another signal Monday. This one has taken the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=93.12s)]
*  lives of 28,000 and counting lives in Turkey and war-torn Syria. For all of us, the ground does [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  feel like it is shifting. Global instability may be a constant for the near future and that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=107.6s)]
*  may be a needed reminder to put our petty political disagreements in perspective. We'll be right back. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCLArWmbV4&t=114.72s)]
