# Ukrainian ambassador to U.S. says Kyiv needs "even more" military aid to defeat Russia
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA)
*  We are joined by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome back to the program. Always good to have you here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=3.96s)]
*  I understand you are just back from visiting your family in Ukraine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=7.72s)]
*  Over the holidays, we saw Russia bombed hospitals on Christmas, on New Year's. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=12.8s)]
*  They were also bombing your country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=18.32s)]
*  What is life like during the holiday season? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=20.36s)]
*  Well, it was it was very good to be home. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, when this invasion started in February 24th, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=27.32s)]
*  until my first trip home in April, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=32.6s)]
*  and it was right after my hometown was liberated a couple of days, literally before that, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  I always woke up thinking, is that a bad dream? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  Like, I always try to, you know, fight with the reality. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=44.88s)]
*  But, you know, going back always, on the one hand, gives you a good perspective of how horrible it is. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  And on the other hand, inspires because you see everyone not giving up. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=56.04s)]
*  And everyone is, even throughout the holiday seasons, when the bombs are still flying everywhere, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=60.72s)]
*  the destruction is enormous. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=66.92s)]
*  People are very focused on winning. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=69.16s)]
*  People are very focused on helping each other. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=71.2s)]
*  And there was still a festive spirit everywhere. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=73.8s)]
*  People were singing, you know, people were trying to give gifts to each other. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=76.8s)]
*  But of course, the main focus is helping our brave defenders and doing everything possible to win. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=81.16s)]
*  We were just talking with Senator King about this massive package President Biden just signed off on, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=87.84s)]
*  which also had sort of increase in the type of weapons and defense items for Ukraine. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=92.8s)]
*  Why do you need this so immediately? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=99.96s)]
*  What are you preparing for? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=102.52s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me take this moment to thank the previous Congress for voting on the legislation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=103.96s)]
*  And allowing us to have the possibility to have these packages this year [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  for everything that we need from the financial assistance, but most importantly, security assistance. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=117.04s)]
*  That was at $45 billion. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=121.76s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=123.0s)]
*  And the fact that, you know, we have this support from American people is very valued in Ukraine. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=124.0s)]
*  So everyone, you know, President, Congress, big thank you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  Why do we need more? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  Because we see that, A, we need to increase the liberation speed of our land. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=135.76000000000002s)]
*  We need to free more people as soon as possible, because we see what happens when they're under occupation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=142.36s)]
*  We also do not intend to stop. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=147.8s)]
*  We do not intend to take operational pauses, which Russia probably needs, because they [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=149.56s)]
*  have problem with their motivation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=154.0s)]
*  They have problem with even the rockets. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=156.12s)]
*  I mean, they have so many of them. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  But we would like to faster get to peace, which means we have to liberate our territories faster. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=162.16s)]
*  So whatever we can get from air defense to all the armored vehicles to everything that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=170.4s)]
*  you saw in the package, we need even more because we are facing much larger enemy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=176.32s)]
*  So this package of $45 billion from the last Congress should take you through next year, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=181.92s)]
*  according to some officials, U.S. officials. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=186.44s)]
*  When President Zelensky was here in Washington on that surprise visit, he did meet with Kevin [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  McCarthy, who is now Speaker of the House. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=193.72s)]
*  Did you get assurances that U.S. support will continue with Republicans in control? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=196.11999999999998s)]
*  We are fighting for the same values and for the same principles. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  We are fighting against the evil, which is a threat not only to Ukraine, it's existential [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=205.6s)]
*  threat for us, but it's a threat to everyone who believes in democracy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=210.2s)]
*  And I can say that our meetings during the president's visit here, both with president, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=214.2s)]
*  administration, but also with all leaders in Senate and House of Representatives on [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=218.8s)]
*  a very strong bipartisan basis have been very constructive and very productive. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=224.24s)]
*  I believe American people support us and will support us until we together can win this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=228.4s)]
*  When the president was here, President Zelensky was here, he said financial assistance is [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=236.12s)]
*  not charity, it's an investment. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=239.8s)]
*  And he said Ukraine will be responsible with it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=241.28s)]
*  Given the concerns about corruption over the years past, how do you respond when you were [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=243.68s)]
*  asked that question of how do you guarantee every dollar being given to Ukraine is going [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=248.96s)]
*  to defense and not to, you know, embezzlement or something else? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=253.84s)]
*  I can only quote Senator King, who was just here. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=257.36s)]
*  First, on, there are three types of assistance, right? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=259.96s)]
*  Budget assistance, security and humanitarian. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=263.36s)]
*  On security, we are not getting the money, we are getting the goods, and we are very [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=266.68s)]
*  grateful for them. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=269.76s)]
*  The accountability for every piece that we are getting is there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=271.20000000000005s)]
*  We are not only sharing information, we are implementing NATO systems in place, and we [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  are already, and already are providing information, and we know where everything is located. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  On the budget assistance, we have reported on all assistance that has been provided to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=284.12s)]
*  us. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=289.92s)]
*  There is an audit underway. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=290.92s)]
*  But we have also sent—I mean, it's very clear where we are spending the money on. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  And our Ministry of Finance has reported even before the audit is complete, and I have shared [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  that report with every member of the previous Congress, and we intend to do so in the future. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=301.16s)]
*  The inspector generals are involved already, from Pentagon, but from other, from Department [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=306.4s)]
*  of State, from Treasury. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=310.64s)]
*  So we are not only open and ready, it's in our interest as well. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=312.4s)]
*  In order to prove why we need more and that we are using it very effectively and efficiently, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=318.08s)]
*  we would like to be as open as possible. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=324.44s)]
*  Every U.S. dollar that is given to us, we are putting it to a good use, and we are using [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=327.32s)]
*  it as an investment into our joint fight for democracy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=332.32s)]
*  I want to ask you about something we've talked about in the past, and that is what's happening [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=336.24s)]
*  to Ukraine's children. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=339.8s)]
*  More than 13,000 were deported to Russia. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=342.52s)]
*  Are you having any luck in getting your children back? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=345.64s)]
*  Well, first, unfortunately, we know the number is much larger than that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=348.6s)]
*  is the official number of the children we accounted for, we found. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=353.64s)]
*  But we know that we already have so many, you know, tens, if not hundreds of thousands [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=357.4s)]
*  of people who we don't know their fate yet, and until we liberate our territories, we [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=363.36s)]
*  will not know. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=367.56s)]
*  Out of the 13,000, the vice prime minister already informed that 212 have been returned. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=369.0s)]
*  212 is, of course, a small number, even though, unlike Russians, every child and every child [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=375.84s)]
*  and every life is very precious to us. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=382.2s)]
*  So we are so happy that these 212 are home, but we will not get tired and we will not [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  stop until all of them are back home. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=392.44s)]
*  That's why we need more weapons to liberate our territories and people. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  Ambassador, we'll continue to follow the story and talk to you. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=399.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MEObOa1QAA&t=402.91999999999996s)]
