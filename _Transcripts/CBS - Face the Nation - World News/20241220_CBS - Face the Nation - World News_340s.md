# Does the German Christmas market attack speak to a security failure?
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4)
*  And dozens of people are injured and at least two are dead after a car rammed into a crowded [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=0.0s)]
*  Christmas market in the central eastern part of Germany. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=5.26s)]
*  Police have arrested the driver, a 50-year-old Saudi Arabian doctor who has lived in Germany [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=8.94s)]
*  for several years. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=13.86s)]
*  Local officials suspect this to be a deliberate attack. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=15.36s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd joins us now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=19.78s)]
*  So Sam, let's talk about what authorities believe at this moment. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=23.54s)]
*  Do they think that the suspect acted alone and what are the next steps to try and determine motive? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=28.82s)]
*  Well, Lana, I'll stress we are in the very nascent stages of the investigation, but authorities [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=33.96s)]
*  at this juncture do believe that this was a lone actor, what they call a lone wolf attack, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=39.02s)]
*  and that this individual acted alone. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=44.72s)]
*  However, they have yet to exploit this individual's devices, to look at his social media and to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  truly confirm whether or not he was in touch with others and perhaps shared his plotting, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=51.72s)]
*  tactics or techniques. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=57.74s)]
*  So very nascent stages of the investigation at this time. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=59.06s)]
*  And Sam, we have seen incidents like this before in Europe, one that almost entirely [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=62.5s)]
*  matches what we saw tonight that took place in 2016 just a little bit further away in Berlin. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=67.82s)]
*  Does the fact that this happened speak to a security failure? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=76.66s)]
*  Well, having worked many of these lone wolf cases, I will tell you it is incredibly difficult [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=80.1s)]
*  to identify individuals who are mobilizing or radicalizing to violence on their own. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=85.88s)]
*  So this is not necessarily a security failure. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=90.96s)]
*  It speaks to the very, very complex threat environment. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=93.44s)]
*  We do understand that this individual was not on law enforcement's radar, but unfortunately [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  again in this complex threat environment that is not entirely unusual. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=101.6s)]
*  Not on the radar in many ways does not seem to fit a profile that we would expect in a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=106.64s)]
*  case like this, particularly the fact that he was a doctor. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=112.88s)]
*  You think of doctors as taking an oath to do no harm. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=116.08s)]
*  But Sam, I'm even just wondering, we've focused before on other holiday markets in Europe, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=122.32s)]
*  but when it comes to lone wolves and people who have become radicalized, how difficult [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  then is it anywhere in the world to secure big public events, times of festivities during [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=134.84s)]
*  the holidays? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=141.32s)]
*  Well, what we call mass gatherings during high profile times like the holidays are notoriously [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=142.82s)]
*  difficult to secure, particularly if they are outdoors. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  When an event is outdoors, there are multiple entry points by land, by air and otherwise [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=153.5s)]
*  for a bad actor to try to inflict harm. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=159.26s)]
*  Now, many of these Christmas markets and other types of festivals in Germany and around the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  world do have vehicular barricades surrounding them. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=166.34s)]
*  The level of security is commensurate oftentimes with the threat assessment, but also what [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=170.72s)]
*  resources local law enforcement has available at the time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=175.5s)]
*  So securing these events is incredibly difficult and there is not always an indication that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=179.34s)]
*  the threat environment is heightened, not only because lone wolves operate so far below [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=184.22s)]
*  the radar in a lot of cases. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=188.5s)]
*  And Sam, talk to our viewers about the threat assessment in Germany at this moment, or leading [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=190.58s)]
*  up to this moment rather, because you and I have talked about all of these different [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=196.56s)]
*  flash points that have inflamed tensions, particularly when it comes to different religious [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=200.92s)]
*  groups around the world. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=208.64s)]
*  What was it like in terms of a threat assessment in Germany? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=211.92s)]
*  How concerned were German authorities about the threat of terrorism? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=216.04s)]
*  Well, just to be clear, we don't know this individual's motivation at this time. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  He may have been motivated by personal grievances. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=224.46s)]
*  He may have been motivated by extremist ideology. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=227.02s)]
*  I will say this type of attack does have the landmark traits of Islamic terrorism in other [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  forms like the 2016 Berlin attack that you mentioned. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=235.94s)]
*  The threat environment in Germany and in Europe and really globally is incredibly heightened [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=239.18s)]
*  right now based upon a range of developments, including Hamas' terrorist attack against [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=243.54s)]
*  Israel on October 7th over a year ago, as well as Israel's operations in Gaza and in [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=249.6s)]
*  other parts of the Middle East. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=255.4s)]
*  That has led to really a proliferation of extremist recruitment and retention around [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=256.8s)]
*  the world in an even more heightened threat environment. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=261.8s)]
*  But more broadly, the threats of lone actors and small groups of individuals quickly radicalized [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=264.76s)]
*  to violence has increased significantly over the past few years. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  And Sam, absolutely right, we are still waiting to hear from authorities what the likely motivation [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=276.9s)]
*  was for this attack, but they do believe that it was deliberate. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=282.78s)]
*  And part of that belief comes from the fact that, as Haley pointed out, there were actual [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=285.78s)]
*  explosives that this individual had accessed. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=291.9s)]
*  What does that tell you about potential motivation or a desire to inflict harm? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=297.26s)]
*  Well, again, it doesn't speak really to why this individual radicalized to violence and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=303.88s)]
*  mobilized to violence. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=308.52s)]
*  It does speak to the fact that the individual wanted to inflict mass casualties and planned [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=309.52s)]
*  and prepared to do so. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=315.52s)]
*  Access to a vehicle is fairly easy. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=317.52s)]
*  Driving a vehicle into a crowd does not take a lot of planning other than identifying a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=320.52s)]
*  spot, but packing explosives into a vehicle, acquiring explosives that takes more time [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=324.36s)]
*  and speaks to a heavier degree of planning and preparation ahead of this attack and desire [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=330.54s)]
*  to inflict mass casualties. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=334.7s)]
*  Alright, Sam Vinograd, thank you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=336.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNvgqHIhnt4&t=338.82s)]
