# Syrians celebrate end of the Assad family's half-century rule after president flees country
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk)
*  For the first time in 54 years, the al-Assad family is no longer ruling Syria. Rebels who'd [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=0.0s)]
*  been fighting government forces for 13 years swept through Syria in two weeks, capturing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=8.48s)]
*  Damascus, taking the Syrian people and the world by surprise. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=14.68s)]
*  Dictator Bashar al-Assad appears to have fled the country, and we are reminded this morning [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=20.04s)]
*  of the horrors from his reign of terror. His brutal suppression of anti-regime protests [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=24.84s)]
*  in 2011 sparked the world's largest refugee crisis. Since then, the mass atrocities became [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=30.2s)]
*  too numerous to detail, the death toll impossible to tally, including due to the regime's use [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=36.78s)]
*  of chemical weapons against civilians. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=43.04s)]
*  Assad dared to test whether America and the world would stop him, something then-President [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=46.32s)]
*  Obama chose not to do militarily, even after he crossed that so-called red line. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=51.12s)]
*  Here's our Bob Schieffer's report on Assad's chemical weapon attack from 2013. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=57.12s)]
*  The death toll in what appears to be a poison gas attack in the Syrian civil war continues [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=61.8s)]
*  to rise. By some estimates, as many as 1,800 people may have been killed. Rebels blame [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=67.52s)]
*  the Syrian government, which continues to deny any responsibility. Whoever is responsible, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=73.52s)]
*  perhaps nothing can better help us understand the horror of Syria than this video of a mother [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=79.76s)]
*  telling her small child goodbye, almost as if she is hugging her goodnight and tucking [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  her into bed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=93.0s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump met Saturday with French President Emmanuel Macron, as [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=94.84s)]
*  well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is lobbying for more aid from the U.S. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  and NATO allies in his country's war with Russia. In a post on his Truth Social website [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=104.68s)]
*  early this morning, Mr. Trump blamed Assad's defeat on the entanglements of his allies, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=110.16s)]
*  saying Russia lost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine, and along with Iran, Russia is [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=115.72s)]
*  in a quote, weakened state right now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=121.28s)]
*  Trump called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, saying that Zelensky and Ukraine [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=124.64s)]
*  wanted to make a deal to stop the madness. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=128.88s)]
*  We begin our coverage today with our MTS Tayyip reporting from the Turkish-Syrian border. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=132.36s)]
*  Scenes like this would have been unthinkable just one week ago. Syrian rebels in the heart [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=139.16000000000003s)]
*  of Damascus celebrating the fall of the regime, with the whereabouts of President Bashar [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  al-Assad unknown. As people wept for joy in the streets, shouting freedom. Some rebels [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=150.8s)]
*  appeared on state TV to announce Assad's removal. His stunning defeat was at the hands of an [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=160.12s)]
*  alliance of armed groups who launched a lightning-fast offensive seemingly out of nowhere, and who [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=167.0s)]
*  faced little resistance from the Syrian army. The rebel forces say they have now quote, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=173.8s)]
*  fully liberated a number of major cities, and have also emptied prisons filled with [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  those who dared to stand up against Assad's rule during the country's nearly 14-year civil [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=186.32s)]
*  war. A war that up until now had seemed frozen, even forgotten. But as the statues and monuments [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=191.28s)]
*  to the Assad dynasty continue to be pulled to the ground, the family's blood-soaked [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=200.84s)]
*  half-century of authoritarian rule passed from father to son is now over. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=207.2s)]
*  Ten years ago, at the height of the civil war, which was born out of the Arab Spring [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=215.32s)]
*  uprisings, Assad was then just barely clinging to power. But Russia and Iran, along with [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=219.64s)]
*  Lebanon's powerful Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia, came to his rescue, and tipped the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=227.28s)]
*  war firmly in his favour through a punishing campaign of well-documented war crimes, including [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=234.88s)]
*  indiscriminate airstrikes and chemical weapons attacks. A brutality against his own people [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=244.28s)]
*  that's hard to fathom. But Russia is now preoccupied with its war on Ukraine. Hezbollah's leadership [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=250.44s)]
*  has been decapitated after a year of bitter fighting with Israel, and Iran, along with [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=258.04s)]
*  its other proxies, have also been degraded by Israeli strikes. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=264.64s)]
*  Iran's 24-year rule looks unlikely to be rescued or resurrected, ushering a new but [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=270.44s)]
*  deeply uncertain era for Syria. And a key leader of Syria's armed opposition, Abu Mohammed [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=277.08s)]
*  al-Jilani, who belongs to a group known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which used to be aligned [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=284.6s)]
*  with al-Qaeda, has forbid anyone to go near the buildings housing Syria's state institutions, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=290.64s)]
*  signaling the rebels want to support a peaceful transition of power. But the power vacuum [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=296.8s)]
*  left by Bashar al-Assad is enormous, Margaret, and the fear is these groups could soon turn [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=301.88s)]
*  on each other and begin a new, perhaps even darker chapter in this already ugly civil [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=307.32s)]
*  war. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt4mSm8cXk&t=313.84000000000003s)]
