# Russia and Iran strengthen ties ahead of Trumpâ€™s inauguration
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I)
*  The presidents of Russia and Iran met in Moscow Friday to sign a broad 20-year treaty. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=0.0s)]
*  The two leaders say the strategic partnership covers all areas, including trade, military [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=5.0s)]
*  cooperation, scientific collaboration, education, and culture. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  And they signed the agreement just days before President-elect Trump is sworn into office. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=14.36s)]
*  On the campaign trail, he vowed to take a tougher stance on Iran and work to broker [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  peace in Ukraine. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=21.66s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Vindigrad joins us now for our weekly national [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=23.16s)]
*  security wrap-up. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=27.28s)]
*  So Sam, how could this treaty affect U.S. policy toward Russia and Iran, especially [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=28.28s)]
*  with Trump taking office? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=31.76s)]
*  Well, Lindsay, President-elect Trump is expected to make some pretty major U-turns on policy [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=33.36s)]
*  toward both Iran and Russia. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=39.28s)]
*  So the timing of this cooperation treaty does not seem coincidental, just three days before [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=41.56s)]
*  he is inaugurated. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=47.0s)]
*  It is worth noting that Russia and Iran have a pretty checkered past. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=48.84s)]
*  They haven't always been close. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=52.92s)]
*  But in recent years, their relations have been warming. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=55.08s)]
*  For example, in July 2022, Vladimir Putin met with his counterpart in Iran. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=57.98s)]
*  And after that meeting, Russia received approval to start manufacturing Iranian drones within [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=63.42s)]
*  Russia that they're using already on the battlefield in Ukraine. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=69.22s)]
*  And reportedly, Iran has sent ballistic missiles to Russia as well. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=72.66s)]
*  Fast forward to this past week, and the two countries signed a treaty that does not require [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=76.62s)]
*  each other to come to each other's defense, like Russia's treaty with North Korea does. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=82.38s)]
*  What it entails is a promise not to aid the other's aggressor during any kind of conflict. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=87.28s)]
*  It also, for example, allows for Russian LNG exports to pass through Iran on the way to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=93.68s)]
*  the Persian Gulf. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=100.0s)]
*  So I would expect more of a warming of ties between these two countries as they seek to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=101.0s)]
*  counterbalance against United States under President-elect Trump. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=106.04s)]
*  President Biden said this week that these foreign adversaries are cozying up to each [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=110.4s)]
*  other out of weakness, not strength. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=113.16s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=115.06s)]
*  I do agree. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=116.62s)]
*  Iran is seriously weakened. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=117.62s)]
*  Russia is starved for revenues after both countries, in fact, are suffering crippling [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=119.34s)]
*  sanctions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  And I do think that as increased pressure faces both countries for different reasons, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  both through military losses and economic losses, they're going to need different partners. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=129.9s)]
*  So I would expect them to continue growing closer. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=135.06s)]
*  But this is a sign of weakness as they're struggling to find friends when they need [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=137.18s)]
*  them the most. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=141.1s)]
*  Shifting to other news this week, President Biden's decision to remove Cuba from the state-sponsored [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=142.98s)]
*  terrorism list. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean, is it pretty widely expected that Trump will reverse this? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  And can you remind us the history there? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=151.22s)]
*  My sources within the Biden White House are telling me that they expect President-elect [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=154.14s)]
*  Trump's administration to add Cuba back to the list in relatively short order. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=158.06s)]
*  Now, Cuba was one of four countries on this list. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=163.06s)]
*  Iran, North Korea, and Syria still remain on the state-sponsors of terrorism list. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=166.14s)]
*  And Cuba has been on and off this list for decades. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=171.38s)]
*  More recently, President Obama removed Cuba from this list in 2015. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  And then President Trump added them back on in 2021, just days before he left office. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=180.1s)]
*  It is worth noting that being on this list shouldn't be an arbitrary decision by an administration. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=186.18s)]
*  To be on the list, there must be a careful analysis that the country is repeatedly engaged [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=191.54s)]
*  in acts to support international terrorism. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=196.46s)]
*  Being on the list comes with a range of sanctions, including a restriction on foreign assistance, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=199.94s)]
*  as well as export controls. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=205.58s)]
*  So we'll see how long this removal lasts. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=207.06s)]
*  But during this period, there is a series of potential financial windfalls for Cuba that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=209.94s)]
*  could materialize. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=215.94s)]
*  Samantha Vinograd, have a great weekend. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=216.94s)]
*  Same to you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_BC2dVw9I&t=219.54000000000002s)]
