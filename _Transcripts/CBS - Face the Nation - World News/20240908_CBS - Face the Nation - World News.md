# Rep. Jim Himes says Biden came to office with "binding agreement" on Afghanistan from Trump
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis)
*  Joining us now is the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Democrat Jim [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=0.0s)]
*  Himes of Connecticut. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=3.84s)]
*  Congressman, good morning to you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=5.2s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Margaret. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=8.48s)]
*  A lot I want to get to with you, but I did want to offer you a chance to respond, if [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=9.48s)]
*  you care to, to Congressman McCaul. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=13.16s)]
*  I know you and most Democrats supported President Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=15.32s)]
*  although I think you'd agree the exit was one of the darkest days of his presidency [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=20.56s)]
*  to date. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=25.0s)]
*  What do you make of the Republican argument that this reflects on Vice President Harris's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=26.44s)]
*  abilities to serve as commander-in-chief? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=30.32s)]
*  Well, you're right, Margaret, when you say that that was a very dark day. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  Any time we lose service members, it's a very dark day, and the 13 that we lost at [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=37.32s)]
*  Abigate are rightly remembered. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=40.92s)]
*  And you know how you remember them best. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=43.44s)]
*  You remember, as you pointed out in your interview with Chairman McCaul, that there were also [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=44.88s)]
*  almost 2,500 others killed in Afghanistan over a 20-year period. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=49.0s)]
*  What Chairman McCaul is going to offer to the American people, though, is, and you said [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=54.36s)]
*  it right, it's going to be about Vice President Harris. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=57.16s)]
*  It is a politicized, cherry-picked report designed to do one thing, not shed light on [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=60.96s)]
*  a tragedy, which, by the way, I would support 100 percent. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  And by the way, let's also look at the 20 years and the four presidents that doubled [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=70.84s)]
*  down on Afghanistan policy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  It is going to be a nakedly partisan campaign thing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=75.7s)]
*  And then Chairman McCaul said it at the end there, you know, the military issues that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=80.4s)]
*  he was raising, you know, he didn't mention the fact that when he said that President [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=85.9s)]
*  Biden came with an agenda to withdraw from Afghanistan, President Biden did not come [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=90.9s)]
*  with an agenda. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=94.54s)]
*  He came with a binding agreement negotiated by President Trump, who also released 5,000 [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=96.54s)]
*  Taliban. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=99.98s)]
*  And by the way, and here's the key point that didn't come up, who also left President [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=101.98s)]
*  Biden with 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=104.38000000000001s)]
*  Margaret, when we were attacked on January 6th on the Capitol, in the days after, we [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=108.26s)]
*  had more than 2,500 National Guardsmen guarding the Capitol. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=112.25999999999999s)]
*  That's the tools and that's the agreement that Donald Trump left President Biden with. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=116.25999999999999s)]
*  And there were thousands more NATO troops as well, so the 2,500 is a little bit [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=120.86s)]
*  misleading. But let's put that aside just to honor our allies there that I sure, surely [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=124.86s)]
*  you know about. I want to ask you about the ISIS threat. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=130.66s)]
*  On Friday, it was disclosed that a 20-year-old ISIS supporter was apprehended 12 miles [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=134.74s)]
*  from the U.S.-Canada border. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=140.74s)]
*  The FBI said the individual was a Pakistani citizen residing in Canada who was planning [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=142.74s)]
*  a mass shooting attack in New York City on or around October 7th to kill as many Jews [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=147.74s)]
*  as possible. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=153.74s)]
*  Do you have any insight into whether this individual was self-radicalized? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=155.74s)]
*  Was he directed? What is the threat picture here? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=159.74s)]
*  Yeah, you know, we've been out of session for some time, so it's been a little while [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=162.82000000000002s)]
*  since I've had a classified briefing, so I probably can't specifically answer the question [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=168.82000000000002s)]
*  about that individual. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=173.82000000000002s)]
*  What I can tell you is two things. Number one, ISIS is dedicated, as is, by the way, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=175.82000000000002s)]
*  Iran and any number of other groups, to trying to strike the United States. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=181.82000000000002s)]
*  That is a fact, and that is why it is so important that the work of the intelligence [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=186.82000000000002s)]
*  community and the FBI to stop that stuff, and they're pretty good at that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=190.9s)]
*  You saw the arrests, of course, of the eight people who were affiliated with terrorist [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=194.9s)]
*  groups. They're very good at what they do. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=199.9s)]
*  It's very hard for them to be perfect, but it's also important that we not over-exaggerate [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=202.9s)]
*  the threat here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=206.9s)]
*  We have come a very long way. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=208.9s)]
*  I'm actually just back from a 9-11 ceremony on the 23rd anniversary celebrating or [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=210.9s)]
*  memorializing that hideous attack. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=215.9s)]
*  The intelligence community, the military, the FBI have come a long way since 9-11, and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  as a consequence, we learn about these things and hopefully will be in a position to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=223.98000000000002s)]
*  obstruct as many of them as possible. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=227.98000000000002s)]
*  Fair point. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  I want to switch gears if I can, and you are right to remind us all that we are coming [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=233.98000000000002s)]
*  up on that 9-11 anniversary and memorial to all of those. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=240.98000000000002s)]
*  On the question of election interference, we got these disclosures from the intelligence [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=246.06s)]
*  community this week and the Justice Department. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=252.06s)]
*  This was a sophisticated scheme to interfere in the election by setting up fake news [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=255.06s)]
*  sites, paying $10 million to a Tennessee-based company to launder Moscow's propaganda. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=260.06s)]
*  They used podcasters, they used well-known personalities on YouTube to trick American [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=267.06s)]
*  voters in swing states, according to the DOJ. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=272.14s)]
*  How effective has this campaign been? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=277.14s)]
*  Well, that's a really hard question to answer, Margaret, because that gets into the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=283.14s)]
*  question of, you know, gosh, are these crazy right-wing websites and right-wing [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=286.14s)]
*  journalists who evidently their money came from Russia, are they actually having an [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=290.14s)]
*  impact on the election? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=295.14s)]
*  It's sort of hard to believe in a 50-50 election that's going to be played out in sort [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=297.14s)]
*  of four or five states that it's not going to have some impact on the margin, which [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=300.21999999999997s)]
*  is why two things are really important. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  Number one, back to the FBI, back to our intelligence community. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  They need to double down on identifying, naming and shaming those countries that are [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  doing this, and Chairman McCaul was right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  It's primarily Russia. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  Russia has really pulled out all the stops, but it's also China, it's also Iran. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  There's even some other countries that are thinking about it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  But, Margaret, I feel very passionately about this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  They can only succeed if American citizens hand over their autonomy, their sovereignty, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=324.3s)]
*  their critical thinking abilities to the Russians or to the Chinese. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=331.3s)]
*  And so what I always tell my constituents, if you're looking at some random social media [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=335.3s)]
*  site and you are getting hotter and hotter and angrier and angrier and people who [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=339.3s)]
*  disagree with you are not just the opposition, but they're traitors, you know what you're [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=343.3s)]
*  doing? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=347.3s)]
*  You are being manipulated. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=348.3s)]
*  And it may just be by Facebook's algorithms, but there's some chance it might actually [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=349.3s)]
*  be the Kremlin or the Chinese or the Iranians who are manipulating you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=352.38s)]
*  And if you're going to be manipulated that easily, guess what? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=356.38s)]
*  This country is going to get the democracy that we deserve. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=359.38s)]
*  Vladimir Putin publicly said he was endorsing Vice President Harris this past week. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=363.38s)]
*  U.S. intelligence, though, assesses that it is Donald Trump that is, in fact, Moscow's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=369.38s)]
*  preferred candidate. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=374.38s)]
*  Do you know whether Putin is directing this particular campaign? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=376.38s)]
*  Well, I will tell you that super sensitive things like meddling in U.S. elections, you [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=381.46s)]
*  know the nature of the Kremlin and of Putin and of his autocracy. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=388.46s)]
*  Nothing serious happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin signing off on it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=393.46s)]
*  So precisely how involved he is is an open question. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=398.46s)]
*  But believe me, yes, he would. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=402.46s)]
*  And look, you know, the whole, you know, I'm endorsing Harris thing. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=404.46s)]
*  All you need to do is listen to the way the two candidates talk about Russia and Ukraine [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=408.53999999999996s)]
*  and you can develop a pretty independent sense of what Putin would like to see happen on [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=413.53999999999996s)]
*  Election Day. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=417.53999999999996s)]
*  You said earlier this week that banks are required to research their clients. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=419.53999999999996s)]
*  When you were being asked about this case of a Tennessee-based company that CBS is [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=424.53999999999996s)]
*  reporting is Tenant Media that was being manipulated by the Russians, what is the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=429.53999999999996s)]
*  principle you're asking to be applied here? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=435.62s)]
*  Well, I guess and I'm not talking about legal compulsion necessarily here, although banks [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=438.62s)]
*  are required to know their customers. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=445.62s)]
*  It's nice to imagine that massive social media platforms or massive media platforms like [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=447.62s)]
*  Tenant might actually do a little research to try to figure out where their money is [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=452.62s)]
*  coming from. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=456.62s)]
*  Frankly, the people who look at their media have a right to know where that money comes [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=457.62s)]
*  from. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=461.62s)]
*  At a minimum, check this stuff out because you may not want to be complicit in a Kremlin [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=462.7s)]
*  operation. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpe3mwIkyis&t=466.7s)]
