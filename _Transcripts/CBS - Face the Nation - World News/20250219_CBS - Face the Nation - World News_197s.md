# Vatican gives more details on Pope Francis' condition amid hospitalization
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8)
*  Doctors have diagnosed Pope Francis with double pneumonia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=0.0s)]
*  The Vatican said he had what they described [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=2.84s)]
*  as a peaceful night. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=5.04s)]
*  This marks the sixth day that he's been in the hospital. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=6.04s)]
*  CBS News' senior foreign correspondent, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=8.72s)]
*  there he is, Seth Doan. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=12.26s)]
*  Your name wasn't in the prompter, Seth, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=14.1s)]
*  so I had to guess, or I had to wait [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=15.56s)]
*  until you popped up on the screen [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  to see if it was you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=18.64s)]
*  Just to make sure. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=20.02s)]
*  You're live in Rome for us this morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=21.94s)]
*  So I saw your reporting earlier on CBS Mornings, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=24.44s)]
*  update us on the Pope's condition. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=27.16s)]
*  Well, we haven't heard much from the Vatican. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=30.96s)]
*  Vlad, we know that he had a restful night, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=33.56s)]
*  as you mentioned. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=35.24s)]
*  He woke up, he had breakfast. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=36.08s)]
*  We also understand from a Vatican source [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=37.88s)]
*  that he's not just in bed all of the time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  He is able to get up and sit in an armchair. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=42.08s)]
*  He is breathing on his own. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=44.78s)]
*  We know that he's been on the telephone. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=46.84s)]
*  We also understand that he has strict doctor's orders [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=49.0s)]
*  to rest and to not get visitors, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=51.56s)]
*  but there was one very noteworthy visitor this afternoon. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  The Prime Minister of Italy, Georgia Maloney, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=57.0s)]
*  came to visit him, and Palazzo Chigi, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=58.88s)]
*  her office, like the White House, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=61.72s)]
*  released a statement later in the day [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  that said that the Prime Minister found him alert [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=65.36s)]
*  and responsive and having his trademark humor. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  So a little bit of color. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=72.72s)]
*  This is the first outside visitor [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=73.92s)]
*  that we know of visiting the Pope. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=76.28s)]
*  We know most of his contacts are just with very, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=78.62s)]
*  very close aides and personal secretaries. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=81.0s)]
*  We've heard that he's reviewing documents, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=83.92s)]
*  signing documents, but Georgia Maloney [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=86.28s)]
*  was the first outside visitor he's had that we know of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=88.44s)]
*  since he was hospitalized on Friday. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=92.32s)]
*  So I hate to do this, Seth, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=94.64s)]
*  but I mean, we gotta speculate, right? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=97.12s)]
*  Pope Benedict retired back in 2013. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=99.24s)]
*  He was 85. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=101.72s)]
*  I recall, just like you do, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=104.92s)]
*  I was reporting during conclave for this pope. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=107.88s)]
*  It was an exciting time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=111.74s)]
*  It always is when there's a new pontiff [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=112.88s)]
*  or when there's a conclave for a new pontiff, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=114.44s)]
*  but is there any talk of Pope Francis stepping down? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=116.94s)]
*  Talk, I would say the quick answer is no. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  Talk among journalists, yes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=126.84s)]
*  In fact, we had bumped into the Pope's biographer [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=128.66s)]
*  just yesterday and interviewed him a while back [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=132.62s)]
*  and they spent a lot of time talking [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=134.74s)]
*  and the Pope's biographer said, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=137.06s)]
*  listen, Pope Francis told me [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=138.42s)]
*  that the only reason he thinks about retiring [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=140.82s)]
*  is because so many journalists always ask him about him, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=142.54s)]
*  ask him about it, but we know he told our own [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=146.38s)]
*  Nora O'Donnell back in the spring [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=149.22s)]
*  that he absolutely had no intention to retire. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=151.42s)]
*  You might remember a few years ago, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=154.54s)]
*  there was an interview that came out [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=157.62s)]
*  in which he had acknowledged that early in his papacy, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=160.22s)]
*  he had handed a letter to the Secretary of State [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=163.38s)]
*  that said if he was ever completely incapacitated, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=166.1s)]
*  unable to beat the Pope, that he would resign [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=169.9s)]
*  and that he had handed that possible resignation letter in. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  That came out a couple of years ago, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=177.46s)]
*  but everything that we have heard from this Pope [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=178.74s)]
*  in recent years is absolutely no consideration, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=181.26000000000002s)]
*  no thought of resigning. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=183.98000000000002s)]
*  Seth Doan reporting from Rome for us this morning. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  Seth, thanks for joining us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  I always love having you on and it's so rare, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=190.86s)]
*  so it's good to see you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=192.62s)]
*  Nice to get to talk with you, Vlad, thanks. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1VKNTbo8&t=194.82000000000002s)]
