# More than 300 Americans have left Gaza in recent days, White House official says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8)
*  We go now to White House Principal Deputy National Security Advisor John Finer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=4.8s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=5.8s)]
*  So the U.S. has been trying to get roughly 400 U.S. citizens out of Gaza. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  I understand some have made it out. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=12.32s)]
*  Are all of the Americans out? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=14.72s)]
*  And were there any casualties? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=16.54s)]
*  Margaret, we believe that there are still a number of Americans inside Gaza, but that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=18.6s)]
*  over the last several days, through pretty intensive negotiations with all sides relevant [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=23.48s)]
*  to this conflict, we have been able to get out more than 300 Americans, lawful permanent [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=29.64s)]
*  residents and their family members. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=35.08s)]
*  This is obviously a major priority and one that we are going to continue to work at until [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=37.24s)]
*  every American who wants to leave is able to do so. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=40.72s)]
*  And where do we stand with the negotiations to get hostages freed by Hamas? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=43.84s)]
*  Those negotiations are going on quietly behind the scenes. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  They have taken longer than any of us would like, but we continue to believe that there [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  is the possibility of getting a significant number of these hostages released. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=56.080000000000005s)]
*  And you've heard both President Biden and the Prime Minister of Israel say that there [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=59.68000000000001s)]
*  could be a pause in the fighting to enable that the way there was when two American hostages [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  were released very early in the conflict. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=68.2s)]
*  And we're going to continue to work on that as well. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=70.12s)]
*  Has the Israeli government agreed to pause for a hostage release? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  You heard the Prime Minister of Israel say yesterday that the context in which they would [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  consider a pause would be related to a hostage agreement. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=79.36s)]
*  We don't obviously have yet a hostage agreement, but again, we are working very hard to get [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=82.48s)]
*  one. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=87.12s)]
*  And if that were to take place, just being able to move hostages around the battlefield [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=88.12s)]
*  in a way that is safe, get them to a gate leading outside of Gaza would take time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=91.36s)]
*  And we would want to only be able to do that safely. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=96.58s)]
*  So we believe a pause would be appropriate in that context. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=98.4s)]
*  Understood. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=101.36s)]
*  Secretary Blinken has said that what Hamas is doing with using human shields is monstrous. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=102.36s)]
*  But he also said that he shared with the Israeli government steps they could and should take [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=108.22s)]
*  to minimize harm to civilians. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=114.82s)]
*  That is the closest I've heard a U.S. official come to saying the administration isn't 100% [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=117.06s)]
*  comfortable with what the Israeli military is doing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=123.78s)]
*  Margaret, I think we've said versions of what you heard from Secretary Blinken a number [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=126.78s)]
*  of times, including from the president. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=131.6s)]
*  We've been quite clear that the way that Hamas conducts this fight, launching an appalling [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=134.86s)]
*  attack on Israel and then retreating into the Gaza Strip and essentially concealing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=140.3s)]
*  themselves among a densely populated civilian population, is unconscionable. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=144.52s)]
*  At the same time, while that raises the burden on the Israeli military to conduct this fight [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  and go after Hamas, it does not diminish their obligation to do so in a way that distinguishes [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=156.06s)]
*  between civilians and fighters. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=161.14000000000001s)]
*  And we have had many direct conversations with the government of Israel on that topic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=162.62s)]
*  and will continue to do that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=166.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=168.06s)]
*  But could and should suggest they are not currently. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=169.06s)]
*  The U.S. provides more than $3 billion a year in military aid to Israel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=172.94s)]
*  Does the U.S. need to set conditions on how that U.S. paid-for weaponry is used? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=178.3s)]
*  We build law of armed conflict assurances any time we transfer security assistance to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=185.34s)]
*  country, including Israel. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=191.02s)]
*  And when we see circumstances, events that concern us, we raise those very directly with [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=192.54000000000002s)]
*  the government of Israel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  And again, we will continue to do that as this conflict transpires. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=199.42000000000002s)]
*  But, John, you know that your fellow Democrats, I mean, Senator Chris Murphy said he urges [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=202.34s)]
*  Israel to reconsider its approach and shift to a more deliberate and proportionate counterterrorism [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=208.06s)]
*  campaign. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=213.38000000000002s)]
*  Arab leaders, Arab foreign ministers said yesterday, how can we justify that killing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=215.38000000000002s)]
*  9,000 people is self-defense? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=220.5s)]
*  How close are we to this stopping? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=223.5s)]
*  So what I would say is Israel continues to face an enormous threat from Hamas. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=226.62s)]
*  Obviously, we've seen that threat manifest itself. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=230.9s)]
*  And not only does that threat continue to exist, but you continue to see Hamas say that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=233.62s)]
*  if given the opportunity, they would conduct a version of what they did on October 7th [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=238.06s)]
*  again. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=242.34s)]
*  So the threat has not been eliminated. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=243.34s)]
*  As you say, the devastating toll that this has taken on civilians is one that deeply [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=245.7s)]
*  concerns us, one that we raise in a very direct way, both publicly, as Secretary Blinken has [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  done, as others have done, and privately and directly with the government of Israel. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=255.38s)]
*  There are certain responsibilities that any army has in the context of waging military [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=259.86s)]
*  operation like this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  And they're widely known. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  They're related to international humanitarian law, and we expect them to be followed. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=267.21999999999997s)]
*  John, Secretary Blinken was in Ramallah in the West Bank, as you know, today, meeting [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=271.58s)]
*  with Mahmoud Abbas. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=275.46s)]
*  And he was reportedly talking about a future for the Palestinian Authority and some kind [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=277.62s)]
*  of role in Gaza. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=282.62s)]
*  How close are we to the end of the war if we're talking about a future government here? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=285.02s)]
*  And is the Palestinian Authority really up to the task? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=290.14s)]
*  So I don't want to speculate about how close we are or are not to the end of the war. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=293.29999999999995s)]
*  What I will say, and President Biden has been very clear about this, is that whenever this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=297.70000000000005s)]
*  conflict is over, we cannot go back to the way things were before October 7th, either [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  in Gaza or in the West Bank. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=306.62s)]
*  We've obviously been very concerned during this conflict, but also well before it, about [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=308.98s)]
*  the rise in violent incidents in the West Bank. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=313.14000000000004s)]
*  President Biden has spoken to the role of extremist settlers in that context. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=315.90000000000003s)]
*  That behavior has continued. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=320.42s)]
*  We've expressed that concern directly to the government of Israel. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=322.66s)]
*  We give a lot of credit, frankly, to the Palestinian Authority for the work that it has done to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=325.22s)]
*  prevent the West Bank from spiraling into greater instability, even in the context of [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=329.02s)]
*  what's happening in Gaza. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=334.1s)]
*  And in the aftermath of this, the president has said we need to get back to the urgent [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=335.42s)]
*  work of working towards a two-state solution that includes both Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  I just want to make sure I'm understanding you there. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=344.74s)]
*  There are some ultra-nationalists within the Israeli government who have been very clear [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=346.9s)]
*  of their positions, one of them saying he was going to cut some funding to the Palestinian [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=352.18s)]
*  Authority because he didn't think their reaction was strong enough to October the 7th. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=358.06s)]
*  Another one was also handing out weapons to settlers in recent days. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=362.98s)]
*  Have you convinced the Netanyahu government to stop that? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=369.98s)]
*  You've heard the president speak to, again, serious concerns about the behavior of extremist [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=374.62s)]
*  settlers, violence that has been perpetrated by them in the West Bank that could lead things [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=379.34000000000003s)]
*  to spiral out of control. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  So we obviously don't accept that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=385.66s)]
*  We raise those concerns very directly and have done so. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=387.06s)]
*  We believe now is not the time to reduce support to the Palestinian Authority, given that they [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  are working in many cases alongside Israeli security forces to try to keep a lid on things [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=394.74s)]
*  in the West Bank, and we believe that they should both continue to do so and be supported [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=400.5s)]
*  in that endeavor. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  John Feiner, thank you for your time today. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=406.62s)]
*  Thanks again, Margaret. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFR0mcw4L8&t=408.54s)]
