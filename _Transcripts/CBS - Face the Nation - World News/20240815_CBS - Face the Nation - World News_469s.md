# What's happened in Afghanistan in the 3 years since U.S. withdrawal?
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0)
*  It's been three years since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan and at a Bagram airbase [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=0.0s)]
*  once the center of America's war to unseat the Taliban and topple al-Qaeda. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=5.5s)]
*  The Taliban held a parade showcasing abandoned U.S. and NATO military hardware. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=10.6s)]
*  For more, Margaret Brennan joins us now in CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=16.68s)]
*  and moderator of Face the Nation. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=21.1s)]
*  Margaret, before we get started, I want to play some of the sound from your interview [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  with former CENTCOM commander Frank McKenzie just this Sunday on Face the Nation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=26.22s)]
*  Obviously, you know that he used to command U.S. forces in the Middle East. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=35.1s)]
*  August 15th is the anniversary of the Taliban's seize and control of Afghanistan a few years ago. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=36.58s)]
*  I wonder what you think about U.S. security currently. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think about it a lot, Margaret. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=50.22s)]
*  And three years on, our ability to see inside Afghanistan is quite limited. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  The violent extremist organizations characterized by ISIS-K and other groups, we believe they're [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=57.339999999999996s)]
*  actually expanding. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=63.66s)]
*  They carried out a successful attack in Russia a few months ago. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=64.66s)]
*  I am concerned about the growth of those organizations and I'm concerned about the relative lack [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=67.9s)]
*  of our ability to see what they're doing and act against them should it prove necessary [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=72.25999999999999s)]
*  to do so. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=76.34s)]
*  So I think we're in a weaker state now than we were a year ago or two years ago. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=77.34s)]
*  And I'm concerned about the future. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=80.62s)]
*  So Margaret, if you could just help explain to our viewers what has transpired in these [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=83.34s)]
*  last three years and why this grim assessment from General McKenzie. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=87.2s)]
*  Well, we should say that General McKenzie opposed the U.S. exit back in 2021, though [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=91.5s)]
*  he executed it at the order of President Biden on the plan negotiated by then President Trump. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  But one of the main reasons is exactly what he's detailing there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=104.7s)]
*  The United States has lost much of its intelligence collection ability because it no longer has [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=107.92s)]
*  the physical presence diplomatically or through, you know, actual military bases and intelligence [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=113.7s)]
*  presence on the ground. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=121.66s)]
*  They haven't been able to replicate that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=123.44s)]
*  And since that time, we have seen ISIS-K really emanate out of Afghanistan, becoming really [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=125.1s)]
*  a global terror threat. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=133.52s)]
*  That is of deep concern to the United States, to the point where some critics the administration [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=135.64s)]
*  are now arguing the United States should help the Taliban, our old adversaries, fight ISIS-K [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=140.54s)]
*  in Afghanistan. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=146.7s)]
*  That's the sort of topsy turvy world in which we are right now. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=148.42s)]
*  We also see the Taliban, which is effectively the government of Afghanistan, though not [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  officially recognized as such, building relationships with America's adversaries in Russia and in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=155.89999999999998s)]
*  And that is deeply troubling on a national security basis. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=162.45999999999998s)]
*  Much of the work that was done over the two decades of U.S. involvement has also been [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=166.66s)]
*  erased on the social and political front, Jerika. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=170.6s)]
*  And that is also tough for a lot of American service people, but also the diplomats and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=174.22s)]
*  aid workers who put in so many years to try to shore up things, including women. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  Yes, so much money spent, so many lives lost. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=183.45999999999998s)]
*  As you know, that this month, August 30th, will mark three years since the last U.S. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=187.16s)]
*  service members officially left Afghanistan. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=191.64s)]
*  Over the United States, two decades war, the longest American war in history. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=193.8s)]
*  There were countless Afghan citizens that assisted the U.S. military. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=198.44s)]
*  Some of them were able to leave the country, but there are others that are still stuck [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=201.92s)]
*  in limbo. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=205.76s)]
*  What is the latest on the U.S. efforts to resettle those people? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, this, Jerika, is one of the toughest things to swallow about the way the U.S. exited [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=212.44s)]
*  Afghanistan because the refugee programs in the United States had really been changed [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=218.4s)]
*  in a way that was harmful to quickly getting special immigrant visas, these S.I.V.s, as [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=224.12s)]
*  they call them, put in place. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=229.88s)]
*  The Biden administration says they had to play last minute catch up. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=232.38s)]
*  People were left behind. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=236.82s)]
*  People who worked alongside the United States, Afghans who either worked for or alongside [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=238.12s)]
*  U.S. officials and efforts, and many of them fear for their lives. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  We asked the State Department for an update on the numbers, and they say at this point [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=248.38s)]
*  they have 55,000 applications still pending from Afghans who are seeking those S.I.V.s, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=252.6s)]
*  those special immigrant visas. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=259.56s)]
*  And many fear for their lives if they're in Afghanistan. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=262.04s)]
*  Some of them have also, Jerika, been separated from family members. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=265.02s)]
*  There were children left behind, parents who left, families pulled apart. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  I've spoken to some of the diplomats who were trying to reunite children with parents. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=272.29999999999995s)]
*  This was really such a chaotic way beyond the pictures that continues to have impact [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=277.53999999999996s)]
*  for Afghans, many of them scattered around. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=283.34s)]
*  And it's also become a political flashpoint here in the United States. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=286.7s)]
*  Congress has set a cap on the number of visas allowed. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  So they need an act of Congress to allow more, to raise that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  That's politically controversial. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  Senators like Amy Klobuchar pushing for an Afghan Adjustment Act, some way to address [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=306.08s)]
*  The program itself expires in 2026, and Donald Trump, who very well may win the presidency [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=307.08s)]
*  and take office in January, could put in place what he has promised as a ban on all refugees. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=313.88s)]
*  I asked J.D. Vance, the senator who's running as a possible vice president, whether they'd [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=319.8s)]
*  apply that ban to Afghans, some of whom fought alongside Americans. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=325.0s)]
*  And he kind of split the difference, saying both some should get help, but maybe they [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  shouldn't come here and they have to be properly vetted. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=333.68s)]
*  So it's not clear what will happen to all of them and if the Biden administration can [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=336.20000000000005s)]
*  get all 55,000 out of Afghanistan in the next five months. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=339.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot of people. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=343.24s)]
*  And we know that conditions for women in particular have changed drastically since the U.S. pulled [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=344.62s)]
*  out. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=349.46s)]
*  But I want to turn to another topic that we're constantly talking about, and this is the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=350.46s)]
*  threat that Israel is facing not just with Hamas, but also Iran. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=353.7s)]
*  You know that there have been talks and constant negotiations. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=359.29999999999995s)]
*  Do you think that the diplomacy so far that you're seeing is succeeding and sort of stalling [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  a potential much larger attack than we've seen thus far? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=367.62s)]
*  The word you just used, stalling, is basically it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=372.21999999999997s)]
*  They are delaying, delaying, delaying. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=376.17999999999995s)]
*  That is really the U.S. strategy here to try to restrain Hezbollah and Iran from retaliating [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=378.54s)]
*  against Israel for assassinating a leader of Hamas and a leader of Hezbollah and doing [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=386.62s)]
*  so in a fairly embarrassing way for the government of Iran. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=393.78s)]
*  So that retaliation is viewed still as somewhat inevitable, but shaping just how large it [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=396.74s)]
*  could be is where the diplomats have been focused on one front to try to stop that from [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=401.42s)]
*  becoming a regional war that would draw in U.S. troops because Israel couldn't win a [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=406.46s)]
*  war, finish a war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, who is extremely well armed, without American [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=410.62s)]
*  help. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=417.26s)]
*  So that's one conflict they're looking at. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=418.26s)]
*  In terms of Hamas and the ceasefire effort that Remy was telling you about, that's kind [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=420.44s)]
*  of the centerpiece of the Biden strategy right now. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=425.53999999999996s)]
*  And so American diplomats have essentially bought time. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=428.28s)]
*  The talks are happening today, tomorrow. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=431.78s)]
*  They may spill into the weekend. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=433.94s)]
*  And during that time, my sources say they do not expect Iran to carry out an attack. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=435.36s)]
*  But once we get into the weekend, it is not clear. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=440.68s)]
*  Hezbollah may go it alone from the north. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=443.76s)]
*  They could do so in coordination from the east with Iran. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=447.2s)]
*  That remains to be seen. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=451.16s)]
*  But there is a very big effort on the part of the Biden administration to bring forward [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=452.56s)]
*  a ceasefire and hostage release sometime in the next two weeks. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=457.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=461.40000000000003s)]
*  And we know you'll be following that force and covering it all. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  Make sure you tune in to Face the Nation. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=464.52s)]
*  Margaret Brennan, thank you so much for your time. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=465.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuOpQFJwZ0&t=467.71999999999997s)]
