# Iran's President Raisi's death draws mixed reactions
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4)
*  Iranian officials have confirmed that Cruz found the bodies of the president of the country's president and foreign minister at the site of a helicopter crash. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=0.0s)]
*  63 year old Ibrahim Raisi was viewed as the protege and potential heir to the country's hardline supreme leader. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=8.36s)]
*  The chopper went down in foggy, foggy conditions in a mountainous section of northwestern Iran. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=16.68s)]
*  We are going to bring in Eric Lowe. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=23.0s)]
*  He's an associate professor in the Department of Politics and International Relations at FIU. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=24.56s)]
*  That's Florida International University and a non resident scholar with the Middle East Institute's Iran program. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  It's so great to have Eric. So what are you hearing about how people in Iran are reacting to President Raisi's death? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=36.64s)]
*  Well, not surprisingly, people reacting in the way that Raisi himself was just a polarizing figure. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=45.84s)]
*  So regime supporters are mourning today the death of the president and top officials that were in the helicopter with him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=51.6s)]
*  And then regime opponents are at least not shedding a tear or even celebrating his death as he was a very controversial figure who, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=60.52s)]
*  as president, increased social and religious restrictions against people and fueled those protests that we saw in 2022, 2023 that led to the death, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=71.84s)]
*  that injury and detainment of hundreds of people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=82.12s)]
*  Eric, could you, for the benefit of American audiences who don't know Iran, and that includes myself here, tell us how the system works there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=85.12s)]
*  He's the president, but he's not the supreme leader, so he doesn't have the ultimate power. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=92.56s)]
*  Is he appointed? Was he elected? Does democracy touch any part of it? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=96.44s)]
*  What's the situation? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=100.52s)]
*  Well, democracy is touching the system less and less in the country. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=103.32s)]
*  The supreme leader really has the ultimate power and say, particularly over foreign policy and other policy areas of the country. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=107.88s)]
*  And technically there were elections for president or there are in the case of Raisi, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  many candidates through this body called the Guardian Council, which is overseen by the supreme leader, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=122.48s)]
*  vetted candidates and disqualified many candidates, particularly reformists and moderates, heading into the 2021 presidential election. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=128.08s)]
*  And as a result of that, we actually saw the lowest turnouts, voter turnouts in the history of the Islamic Republic when he was elected president below 50 percent, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=136.16s)]
*  which has also carried over to this year's parliamentary elections. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=145.68s)]
*  And, Eric, we understand that Raisi had the potential to become the supreme leader. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=149.44s)]
*  He was certainly a hardliner. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=154.56s)]
*  Do you see his death as becoming a destabilizing force for Iran at all? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=157.16s)]
*  Well, it's really going to be a question mark for the supreme leader in the conservative camp in terms of who they're going to put forward, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=164.6s)]
*  because in 50 days, as stipulated in the Constitution, they have to have another presidential election. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=172.52s)]
*  The first vice president right now is serving as the interim president. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  But so the question really for the conservative and the hardline camp is who are they going to put forward as a candidate to be the future president of Iran? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=181.72s)]
*  And not only that, but to even be a perspective or potential successor of the supreme leader himself. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=189.32s)]
*  And do you foresee that assignment or that appointment to be somebody who is more hardline or perhaps somebody who might qualm or quash some of the protests we saw a couple of years ago? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  That's really going to be an open question in terms of are they going to continue to double down on these hardline conservative policies in terms of rigging or manipulating elections, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=208.2s)]
*  continuing to impose religious and social restrictions on people, or if they will see an opportunity here, as you suggested, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  where they could dial back some of these tensions and bring some Iranians back into the fold for this country moving forward. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=226.68s)]
*  Yeah. A lot of the Iranians still wish it were 1979, pre-revolution. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=233.44s)]
*  Eric Loeb, a professor at Florida International University. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=237.32s)]
*  Eric, thank you very much. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=240.4s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7SNLyl1A4&t=242.79999999999998s)]
