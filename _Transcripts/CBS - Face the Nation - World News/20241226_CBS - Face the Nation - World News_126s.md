# Officials investigate any possible Russian involvement in Kazakhstan plane crash
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI)
*  Investigators are looking into whether Russian anti-aircraft defenses may have played a key role in the deadly plane crash in Kazakhstan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=0.0s)]
*  The plane was flying from Azerbaijan to Russia when it was diverted and crashed in Kazakhstan on the shore of the Caspian Sea. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=9.0s)]
*  Many questions still remain about why the plane was diverted and what led to the emergency situation that killed dozens of people. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=17.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Lifsay has more. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=24.0s)]
*  Well, there are indeed new developments in the plane crash in Kazakhstan, as investigators now suspect Russian anti-aircraft defenses may have been involved. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=28.0s)]
*  This theory emerged after radar data revealed missile activity in the area at the time of the crash. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=39.0s)]
*  While Russia has yet to comment, aviation experts say this could point to a misfire. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=45.0s)]
*  Authorities in Kazakhstan are working with Russian investigators, but tensions are rising over who will lead that inquiry. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=52.0s)]
*  The Embraer 190 jet went down on Christmas Day just off the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=60.0s)]
*  Rescuers described a chaotic scene as they pulled survivors from the wreckage, some of them missing their shoes. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=70.0s)]
*  The jet split in half and flipped upside down, laid scattered across the ground with debris and casualties stretching for hundreds of feet in this remote part of Central Asia. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=78.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, search teams have recovered critical components of the aircraft, including the black boxes, which are expected to provide more answers in the coming days. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=90.0s)]
*  Now the model of jet, the ERJ 190, is made by a Brazilian company. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=103.0s)]
*  JetBlue is the biggest American company that uses this model, but it had already said it was planning on retiring this model of jet next year. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=110.0s)]
*  Back to you. Chris Lifsay, thank you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJdD7sHmZI&t=120.0s)]
