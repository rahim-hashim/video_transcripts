# Ukraine's port cities bear unrelenting brunt of Russian missile strikes
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ)
*  We turn now to Ukraine, where the Russians have staged unrelenting attacks on the port [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  city of Odessa. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=5.68s)]
*  Our Charlie Dagata filed this report from the region. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=7.38s)]
*  Through the darkness and debris following the bombardment of Ukraine's Black Sea port [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=10.64s)]
*  cities, rescuers shout out, is anybody here? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Even in the daily reality of war, it's still hard to see civilians bearing the brunt of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=22.72s)]
*  it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=27.48s)]
*  In rare access to recaptured territories, we pass through the ruins of Vremytsky. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=28.96s)]
*  Pre-war population, 1,300, now just 15 people, including Viktor and Ljubija, who happily [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=35.04s)]
*  invited us in amid the constant thump of artillery rounds. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=44.04s)]
*  These explosions don't bother you? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=49.92s)]
*  No, those are far away, Ljubija reassures us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=51.8s)]
*  For us, this is like silence. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=55.24s)]
*  You call it silence? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=58.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=59.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=60.4s)]
*  But Viktor says it wasn't that far away that morning, with helicopters hovering overhead [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=61.4s)]
*  in support of ground troops. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=65.52s)]
*  Ljubija's smile never disappeared, even as she cut flowers for her 92-year-old mother, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=68.28s)]
*  who passed away over the winter. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Soldiers helped bury her in the yard. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=78.32s)]
*  The graveyard was too dangerous. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=80.5s)]
*  We eventually made our way to the neighborhoods recaptured by Ukrainian troops in recent days. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=83.72000000000001s)]
*  Here on the very edge of newly liberated territory, not a building has been left untouched. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=89.36000000000001s)]
*  The Ukrainians have managed to push the Russian front line back, but the Russians keep attacking [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  what's left of this place. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  They call areas like this the Zero Line, front-line towns and villages under constant bombardment, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  like Orekiv. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=112.92s)]
*  We last went there in May when we met Deputy Mayor Svitlana Mandrič, running a community [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=114.78s)]
*  center for residents who chose to stay despite the incredible risks. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=120.28s)]
*  This is like a little village inside a village. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  It's like civilization amid all the devastation, she said back then. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=128.56s)]
*  That's until around two weeks ago, when a direct hit from a guided Russian missile destroyed [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=134.96s)]
*  everything, killing seven and injuring 13. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=140.4s)]
*  Svitlana had just left 20 minutes before the strike. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=144.08s)]
*  I'm glad you're OK. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=147.24s)]
*  But she's not OK. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  She's only now found the strength to talk about it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=153.96s)]
*  When we last saw you, you were very positive, very optimistic, very proud of that center. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=157.56s)]
*  Today, you look broken. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm not broken, she said. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=170.24s)]
*  It's just that my heart and my body have been shattered into lots of tiny pieces. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=177.44s)]
*  But I am not broken. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  That's our Charlie Dagoda in Ukraine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueWkeGoHDVQ&t=186.04000000000002s)]
