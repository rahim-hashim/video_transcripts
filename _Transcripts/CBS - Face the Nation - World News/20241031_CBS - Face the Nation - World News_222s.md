# North Korea test-fires intercontinental missile while South Korean officials visit U.S.
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk)
*  Korea has test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile with the potential range to reach [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=0.0s)]
*  the mainland United States. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=4.74s)]
*  The overnight launch comes as U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warns that North Korea [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=6.78s)]
*  has sent some 10,000 troops to train in eastern Russia, with some already moving closer to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=10.26s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=15.74s)]
*  So, for more on this, I want to bring in CBS News national security correspondent Charlie [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  Daggett, who's joining me from the Pentagon to talk about this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  So, this is a big, big deal, Charlie. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=23.66s)]
*  It is a big deal, Vlad. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=26.42s)]
*  First of all, we have to talk about the timing, right? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=28.36s)]
*  It's no coincidence that this test happened on the same day that the South Korean defense [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=30.72s)]
*  minister and the foreign minister are here in D.C. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=35.84s)]
*  There's going to be a news conference later with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=38.6s)]
*  of State Antony Blinken. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=43.88s)]
*  In fact, yesterday, genuinely just down the hall, the South Korean defense minister said [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=45.28s)]
*  it was likely that North Korea would test an ICBM soon. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=50.24s)]
*  And of course, we're on the eve of U.S. elections. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=54.68s)]
*  So, South Korean and Japanese officials say it was fired almost vertically, straight up, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=57.3s)]
*  and it flew for 86 minutes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=64.38s)]
*  It reached a height of more than 4,300 miles before falling into the sea. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=66.78s)]
*  That would be North Korea's longest flight time and the highest altitude ever, which [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=72.22s)]
*  is worrying. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=76.98s)]
*  The U.S., South Korea and Japan all condemn the launch, the U.S. officials calling it [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=77.98s)]
*  a flagrant violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=82.08s)]
*  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un observed the launch. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=88.5s)]
*  He said it was an appropriate military action to show its neighbors North Korea's military [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=92.17999999999999s)]
*  strength, according to state media. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  It's the firstâ€”yeah, go ahead. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=99.02s)]
*  No, no, go ahead, yeah, because the other point that I want to sort of put a fine point [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=102.02s)]
*  on, Charlie, is that you have reported that this is a missile that could potentially hit [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=108.8s)]
*  the United States. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=113.08s)]
*  It is, it is. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=114.08s)]
*  And they already had that kind of technology. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=115.84s)]
*  They've proven that in tests, that in theory they could reach the United States. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=118.24s)]
*  The question is, were they testing it to carry a larger warhead? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=123.56s)]
*  And that, of course, is concerning. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=127.72s)]
*  They've had the distance. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=129.4s)]
*  Now what can you put on it? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=130.76s)]
*  So, the DOD said that they're aware of the launch in the official statement that they [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=132.2s)]
*  came out with, and they urged North Korea to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=137.56s)]
*  acts, in their words. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=144.92s)]
*  Charlie, let me ask you about the presence of North Korean troops in eastern Russia. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=146.92s)]
*  What can you tell me about that? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so just yesterday, again, in that press conference, the defense secretary said that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  the North Korean troops in Russia were, not surprisingly, at the top of the agenda in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=159.28s)]
*  those meetings. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=164.4s)]
*  And we're bound to hear more about it later in a briefing this afternoon. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=165.4s)]
*  But we learned that the North Korean soldiers have been given Russian uniforms, they're [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=169.46s)]
*  carrying Russian weapons, and they are headed toward eastern Ukraine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=174.46s)]
*  So they're reportedly in the Kursk region. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=178.94s)]
*  That's actually in Russia. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=181.02s)]
*  It's a small team. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=182.34s)]
*  It's been described as an advanced party. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=183.5s)]
*  Whether they're going to engage in combat inside Ukraine itself or fight Ukrainian troops [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=186.70000000000002s)]
*  That's an open question that the defense secretary really couldn't answer. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=193.02s)]
*  But he did say it was likely they would be involved in combat missions. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  And if so, they risk injury and death because they will be treated as co-belligerents, the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=200.56s)]
*  words he's using. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=206.84s)]
*  And the Ukrainians can use whatever force they have, whatever weapons they have, and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=207.84s)]
*  that, of course, includes U.S. weapons. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=212.12s)]
*  All right, Charlie Daggett, with some ominous news for us this morning from the Pentagon. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=214.4s)]
*  Thank you, Charlie. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  Thanks, Vlad. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D996I1avIlk&t=221.04000000000002s)]
