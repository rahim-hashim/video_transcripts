# Ukrainian forces push counteroffensive against Russian troops
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng)
*  We turn now to the war in Ukraine. First up are Holly Williams reports from Kyiv. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=0.0s)]
*  In the Russian occupied city of Kherson in southern Ukraine, the authorities installed by Moscow [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  have now ordered all residents to leave ahead of an expected Ukrainian counter-offensive. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Kherson was seized by the Russians in the early days of the invasion. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Now Ukraine claims that Russia's planning to blow up a hydroelectric [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=24.48s)]
*  dam in the region to slow the Ukrainian military's advance [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=28.96s)]
*  and has already laid mines, risking a catastrophic flood. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=32.96s)]
*  Herman Halyshenko is Ukraine's energy minister and told us if the Russians destroy the dam, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=37.6s)]
*  it could even leave a nuclear power plant without water for cooling. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=43.6s)]
*  So if the Russians blow the dam, one potential consequence is a nuclear accident? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=48.08s)]
*  It could be. It could be. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=52.48s)]
*  As Russian forces struggle to hold onto territory they've seized, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=54.72s)]
*  they've launched a new wave of attacks on Ukraine's cities, including with so-called [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  kamikaze drones. The US says Iran is supplying drones and even has troops on the ground helping [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=64.8s)]
*  the Russians operate them. Ukraine says the main target with over 300 strikes is energy facilities. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=73.44s)]
*  As a harsh winter looms, there have already been blackouts in some parts of the country. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=81.2s)]
*  What's the worst-case scenario here? Could Ukrainians end up this winter with no heating [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=86.4s)]
*  and no electricity? I think not, but frankly speaking it also will depend on how intensive [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=90.88s)]
*  these attacks would be in the future. Ukraine says what it's still asking for [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=101.12s)]
*  is more air defence systems from its friends in the West. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=106.88s)]
*  Ukraine says that Russian strikes on Saturday cut off power to more than 1.4 million households. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_iA3OPi2ng&t=111.2s)]
