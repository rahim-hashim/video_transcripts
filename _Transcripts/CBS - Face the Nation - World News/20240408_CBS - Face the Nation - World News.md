# More Democrats call on Biden to stop U.S. weapons transfers to Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE)
*  A growing number of Democrats are expressing their displeasure [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=0.0s)]
*  with the Biden administration's handling of Israel's war on Gaza. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  One of them is Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=7.84s)]
*  I was glad to see the president, at least as reported out, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=11.48s)]
*  finally say to President Netanyahu [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=14.8s)]
*  that if you don't follow these, you know, my requests, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=17.36s)]
*  that there will be consequences. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=23.0s)]
*  But the president and the White House [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=25.32s)]
*  have yet to lay out what consequences they have [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=27.48s)]
*  and they want to impose. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  Wisconsin Democratic Congressman Mark Pocan joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=33.56s)]
*  He is among a group of 40 Democrats on Capitol Hill [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=36.44s)]
*  who have signed a letter calling on the U.S. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  to halt weapons transfers to Israel. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=41.88s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  I know you were with the president today in Wisconsin. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=47.2s)]
*  He was talking student loans, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  but did you get a chance to talk to him about this issue as well? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=51.8s)]
*  I did. I made sure that I told him that we should talk some more, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=56.04s)]
*  that I've done town halls throughout the district. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=59.68s)]
*  The last two weeks, we've been home, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=61.68s)]
*  and that a couple of reoccurring issues have come up, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=63.8s)]
*  one of which is Gaza, and people are rightfully so concerned. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  They're seeing the horrific pictures of devastation, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=71.08s)]
*  dead children, women, 33,000 people dead, 70 percent are men, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=74.16s)]
*  I'm sorry, are women and children, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=78.08s)]
*  and that people really want to make sure we're getting aid to them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=79.64s)]
*  So, lots to do, and I wanted to make sure [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=82.72s)]
*  I got a chance to share that with the president. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=85.72s)]
*  Is there anything you can tell us about how he responded? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=88.6s)]
*  Did you sense that his position is changing at all? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=91.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think he already has been very vocal about a changing position, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  and I think when you look at the letter we signed, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  by the way, reopened it today, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  and I think another 14 people, last count, have also signed onto it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=103.63999999999999s)]
*  So it's a growing letter. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=106.72s)]
*  We're closing at the end of the day, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=108.44s)]
*  but people are hearing it while we're home. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=109.76s)]
*  People are saying, look, we've got to make sure that aid is getting to people. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=113.16s)]
*  Over 200 aid workers have been killed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  People are dying of starvation. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=118.64s)]
*  Children in Gaza, we've got to get food and water, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=120.2s)]
*  and right now we're dropping from the air and bringing it in for the sea, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=122.84s)]
*  but honestly, we should be able to bring it through the checkpoints. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=125.56s)]
*  Since Israel is a good friend of the United States, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=128.44s)]
*  there's no reason that that doesn't happen. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=130.32s)]
*  A lot has to happen different. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=132.96s)]
*  I think the way Benjamin Netanyahu has made this counteroffensive [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=134.52s)]
*  unfortunately has turned into a collective punishment of Palestinians in general, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=139.6s)]
*  and I think that's what I'm hearing from my constituents [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=144.0s)]
*  they're really concerned about. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=145.88s)]
*  So far, at least publicly, the White House has been rejecting your position. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  They say they're not cutting off military aid, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=152.88s)]
*  that Israel is located in a tough neighborhood, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=155.76s)]
*  it constantly faces challenges from Iran, from Iranian-backed groups. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=158.44s)]
*  What is your response to that? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=163.52s)]
*  I mean, this is a really major move you're suggesting for the U.S. government [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=165.92s)]
*  to cut off aid to Israel, a longtime ally. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=170.04s)]
*  Well, not cut off aid. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=174.12s)]
*  What we're saying is you condition aid, first of all, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=175.12s)]
*  so that we're not using bombs to kill children in Gaza. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=177.28s)]
*  And second of all, let's make sure we're getting some real protections [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=180.32s)]
*  for the aid that is getting to people, food, water, medicine. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=183.04s)]
*  And quite honestly, I've heard the president say a lot of this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's not happy with the way Benjamin Netanyahu has run this war. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=188.48s)]
*  And at the end of the day, the longstanding United States position [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=192.84s)]
*  has been a two-state solution, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  recognizing an Israeli nation as well as a Palestinian nation. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=198.52s)]
*  Unfortunately, Netanyahu does not agree with that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=203.36s)]
*  So he's not in sync with U.S. interests. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  I think it's time for a divorce with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=208.56s)]
*  We can support the Israeli people as we should. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  We can support the Palestinian people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  But just because some political leaders are not executing things [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  in a way that I think my constituents in Wisconsin think is humane, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  it means something. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  And I think the president absolutely understands that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=225.11999999999998s)]
*  You talked about the people you've been hearing from at these town halls. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=228.04s)]
*  What has your message been to progressive voters [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  who say they're considering staying home this November [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=233.2s)]
*  because of the president's stance on the war? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, staying home or voting for a third-party candidate [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  often means that that is giving an advantage to Donald Trump, right, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=242.0s)]
*  if you're not voting for Joe Biden. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  And at the end of the day, Donald Trump is bad at many, many things, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=247.72s)]
*  including things like abortion, including things like economics. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, his tax cuts alone added to the national debt. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=257.48s)]
*  And something like 83 percent of the money went to the top 1 percent. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump is not for the average family in Wisconsin, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=264.16s)]
*  where Joe Biden has been reducing costs on health care and energy [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=266.72s)]
*  and today on helping people with student loans. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=270.12s)]
*  I mean, Joe Biden's fighting for that average family in Wisconsin, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=272.56s)]
*  and we have to make sure that we're supporting him at the same time, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  making sure he's hearing from us on issues like Gaza. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=278.92s)]
*  But, you know, Donald Trump would be terrible in this area. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=282.04s)]
*  I mean, you heard Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=285.72s)]
*  say that what talked about what beautiful beachfront property is there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you know, that's beyond Saturday Night Live ridicule. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=291.76s)]
*  Some Israel advocates have argued there shouldn't be a ceasefire [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=295.64s)]
*  until all the hostages are released. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=299.16s)]
*  Do you agree with that position? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=301.92s)]
*  You know, I'm hearing from a lot of people in Israel [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=304.32s)]
*  who want a ceasefire so you can get the hostages. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=306.56s)]
*  And that's part of, I think, the mistake that Netanyahu made. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=309.52s)]
*  He had the military protecting people with illegal settlements, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=312.96s)]
*  Israelis who were making illegal settlements in Palestinian territory [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=318.2s)]
*  at the time of the attack. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=321.4s)]
*  And I think, you know, people, including many of the families, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  think that his eye wasn't on the ball. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=325.76s)]
*  And I think that is something we have to really look at. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  Betrayer Netanyahu has not handled this even up to October 7th very well. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=331.55999999999995s)]
*  This has been a boiling pot in Gaza for probably decades, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=335.84s)]
*  but especially in the last few years. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  So, again, I think what I'm hearing from people in my district [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  is concern over the humanitarian conditions. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=344.55999999999995s)]
*  And at the end of the day, I think we have to really hear those people [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=347.55999999999995s)]
*  who are not a bunch of students or progressive advocates. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  But, you know, my town halls are often attended by a lot of people [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  on Social Security in small communities of 2000 people. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=358.08s)]
*  They're the ones who are raising this issue. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=361.44s)]
*  And that tells me that I think public opinion is significantly different [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=363.32s)]
*  on this issue, and we need to follow that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  Do you think the White House policy on Israel has been clear? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=370.32s)]
*  You have White House officials all the way up to the secretary of state [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=374.23999999999995s)]
*  saying that if Israel's conduct of this war doesn't change, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  that U.S. policy is going to change somehow. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  Is that clear enough for you? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden doesn't wear his foreign policy on his sleeve. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=387.88s)]
*  He has a lot of very private conversations. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=390.68s)]
*  I've seen this in other areas of how he operates. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=392.56s)]
*  But he's starting to be more vocal because he's not seeing the results [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=395.24s)]
*  from Israel that he would like to see, and specifically from Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, let's face it, the average Israeli just doesn't want to have bombs [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=403.04s)]
*  raining on them from Gaza. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  The average Palestinian just wants to be treated with human dignity and respect. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=407.92s)]
*  And they don't have that right now. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=412.56s)]
*  They don't have the human rights they deserve. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=413.72s)]
*  And that both, I think those populations want peace in the region. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=416.08s)]
*  I just think the way this has been executed has been anything [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  but done in a humanitarian way. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=423.88s)]
*  And Joe Biden understands that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=425.76s)]
*  And he's been vocal on it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=427.04s)]
*  And he may not say everything that I'm saying out loud, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  but I think he's saying many of those things privately [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  because you can't not see these things happening. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=433.64s)]
*  Interesting. Congressman Mark Pocano of Wisconsin, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=437.36s)]
*  thanks so much for joining us today. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=439.92s)]
*  Sure. Thank you. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8ATt7jIuE&t=441.96000000000004s)]
