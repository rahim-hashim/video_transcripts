# Jared Kushner’s Gaza comments from a year ago echo Trump’s latest proposal
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k)
*  Gaza's waterfront property, it could be very valuable to, if people would focus on kind [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=0.0s)]
*  of building up, you know, livelihood. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=5.12s)]
*  It's a little bit of an unfortunate situation there, but I think from Israel's perspective, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  I would do my best to move the people out and then clean it up. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=10.56s)]
*  But I don't think that Israel has stated that they don't want the people to move back there [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=13.88s)]
*  afterwards. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=17.56s)]
*  That was Jared Kushner speaking with Harvard University's Middle East Initiative last year. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=19.06s)]
*  And his comments were strikingly similar to what we heard from President Trump Tuesday [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=22.72s)]
*  about the U.S. taking over and rebuilding Gaza. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=26.94s)]
*  Kushner is, of course, the president's son-in-law who took a leading role on Middle East policy [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=29.62s)]
*  during the first Trump administration. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=33.72s)]
*  Let's bring in Tarek Massoud, who facilitated that discussion with Kushner. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=36.22s)]
*  He's a professor of democracy and governance at Harvard University's Kennedy School of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=39.5s)]
*  Government. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=43.74s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=44.74s)]
*  Given what you heard from Kushner last year, what was your reaction when you heard President [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=45.94s)]
*  Trump propose this idea of a Gaza takeover? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=49.34s)]
*  I have to say I was surprised to hear President Trump float this idea of American ownership [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=53.86s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=61.14s)]
*  And the reason I was surprised is because it seemed to fly in the face of what I thought [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=63.1s)]
*  was one of the president's core foreign policy commitments, which was not to get the United [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  States into very difficult entanglements abroad. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=74.06s)]
*  I mean, remember, President Trump was a very strong critic of the Iraq War. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=77.82s)]
*  So for him to be proposing this is very unusual. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=81.38s)]
*  Now, you started with that clip from my conversation with Jared Kushner. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=86.61999999999999s)]
*  And I guess the implication could be that this idea was clearly in the air about a year [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=92.3s)]
*  ago when I had my conversation with Mr. Kushner. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=101.66s)]
*  But we were actually talking about something a little bit different. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  We were talking about an impending Israeli assault on the Gaza city of Rafah and what [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=108.5s)]
*  would be done with the Palestinians who were sheltering there from the Israeli bombing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=116.14s)]
*  And the one proposal that had been offered by multiple sources was that they would go [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=124.5s)]
*  that the Egyptians should accept the Gazans while Israel is mounting this campaign. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=132.64s)]
*  And the Egyptians refused to do that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=139.36s)]
*  And so Kushner was proposing another option, which was to create a safe zone in the negative [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=142.42s)]
*  desert, which is part of Israel, for Gazans. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=151.08s)]
*  And then you saw he ended that discussion by saying that nobody is saying that the people [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=153.68s)]
*  of Gaza would not go back. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=161.12s)]
*  And that was in response to a question I asked. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=162.44s)]
*  I said, look, everybody thinks that once the Gazans leave Gaza Netanyahu will never let [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  them back in. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=169.28s)]
*  And so he addressed that point by saying that that was not what he was talking about. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=170.28s)]
*  But of course, President Trump's statement the other day put all of this in a very different [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=175.72s)]
*  light. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=180.32s)]
*  Dr. and Professor, I don't know which salutation you prefer, but many world leaders say Tarek. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=181.32s)]
*  Come on, you worked hard for those titles. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=190.48s)]
*  Seriously, though, many world leaders say they remain supportive of a two state solution. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=191.16s)]
*  So at this moment in time, in your opinion, is that a realistic possibility? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=195.16s)]
*  You know, I do myself retain some hope for a two state solution. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  But here's what I do know. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  We have now an American president who just is not bound by any of the old certainties [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=209.28s)]
*  or any of the old formulas. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=215.44s)]
*  So it seems pretty clear to me that President Trump at least is willing to entertain arrangements [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=216.96s)]
*  in Israel, Palestine and the broader Middle East that are unlike anything that we've ever [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=225.96s)]
*  thought about before. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=231.84s)]
*  So does that mean that the two state solution is less likely? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  It certainly means that we have an American administration that is not as wedded to the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  two state solution as some of the other administrations have been. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=244.52s)]
*  Professor Dr. Tarek Massoud, thank you for your time. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=247.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=341ul4smM1k&t=251.72s)]
