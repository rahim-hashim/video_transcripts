# U.S. recognizes Venezuelan opposition candidate as election winner despite Maduro claiming victory
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4)
*  The U.S. government says it recognizes opposition candidate Emundo Gonzalez as the winner of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=0.0s)]
*  Venezuela's presidential election. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=5.3s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement there was overwhelming evidence [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=7.46s)]
*  Gonzalez won despite President Nicolas Maduro claiming victory. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=11.28s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Lili Luciano has been following the latest for us. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=15.72s)]
*  So Lili, you obviously were in Venezuela the last few days. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=19.16s)]
*  You saw all of this go down. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=22.46s)]
*  You saw the unrest. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=23.66s)]
*  How do you think this is being received there and what happens next? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=25.0s)]
*  Well, Lindsay, there's been a great deal of gratitude coming from the public in Venezuela [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=28.16s)]
*  who support the opposition and from Emundo Gonzalez Urrutia as well. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=32.44s)]
*  He thanked in a tweet Secretary Blinken for his support and for supporting what he calls [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=36.92s)]
*  a process to restore democratic norms in Venezuela. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=42.84s)]
*  We have not heard a response directly to what Blinken stated from President Nicolas Maduro [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=46.4s)]
*  But he yesterday released some of the points in an agreement that was made prior to the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=53.12s)]
*  election trying to highlight, first of all, stating that he is willing to resume talks [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=59.4s)]
*  with the United States or communication with the United States and highlighting how the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  U.S. had said that or agreed that they would support the results of a democratic election. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=68.16s)]
*  But of course, that would require that the election is democratic. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=74.24s)]
*  And as you heard, what Blinken is saying, it is not. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=77.16s)]
*  Today we are waiting to see if Emundo Gonzalez Urrutia, who is in hiding as well as Maria [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=79.72s)]
*  Corina, will show up because the Supreme Court there in Venezuela called all of the candidates [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  to serve as witnesses in a hearing that will happen today. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  We're not very sure if he, I tried to check and see if he's going to show up or not. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=96.6s)]
*  But at this time, there's a great deal of concern for his and Maria Corina Machado, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  the leader of the opposition who was supposed to be the candidate but was banned from running [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=104.94s)]
*  by the government. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=108.84s)]
*  They're concerned for their safety and their freedom. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=110.4s)]
*  Last night at 3 a.m., apparently masked people or we don't know who it was, but masked armed [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  gangs showed up at his campaign headquarters and threatened the guards who were there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=122.04s)]
*  So there's tension. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  There's going to be mass protests for both sides on Saturday. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=128.6s)]
*  And between now and then, just going by the history and the calls from the government [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  to arrest both of them, blaming or accusing them of inciting violence, there's concern [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=136.76s)]
*  that Emundo and Maria Corina could end up behind bars or remain in hiding and potentially, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=142.12s)]
*  as has happened in the history of opposition leaders in exile. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=149.12s)]
*  Okay, Lillia, I appreciate it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLGd3XOobM4&t=157.04s)]
