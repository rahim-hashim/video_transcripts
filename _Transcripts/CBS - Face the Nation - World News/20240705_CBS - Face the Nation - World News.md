# Labour Party gains control of U.K. government for first time in 14 years
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg)
*  Well, the UK has awoken to a political changing of the guard this morning with Britain's Labour Party claiming a landslide victory in the country's general election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=0.0s)]
*  Voters booted Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party from government after 14 years in power. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=8.84s)]
*  And as Big Ben strikes 10, the exit poll is predicting a Labour landslide. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=17.6s)]
*  I have heard your anger, your disappointment, and I take responsibility for this loss. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=24.56s)]
*  I have just returned from Buckingham Palace where I accepted an invitation from His Majesty the King to form the next government of this great nation. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=30.88s)]
*  Our MTS tie up is following the latest. He joins us from just a gorgeous spot in London. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=47.96s)]
*  And MTS, tell us how this election unfolded and what has the reaction been? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=53.44s)]
*  Hey, Lindsay. Good to be with you. Yeah, we're here in Westminster right in front of Parliament. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=57.04s)]
*  You can see Big Ben over my shoulder. But what a day in British politics. History. Historic, I should say. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=62.24s)]
*  We throw around that word a lot, but this really was. This is the worst defeat that the Conservative Party has faced in its 200-year history. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=69.2s)]
*  This is a party which is known for its electoral success and has really, really, really suffered. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  We now, of course, have this massive majority for the Labour Party. Again, historic as well for this party. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=82.32s)]
*  Now, what happens next? Well, you really are rather in terms of reaction. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's been one that's been kind of mixed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=92.64s)]
*  I think most voters who are kind of really fed up with the politics of the moment are feeling like, well, this is what we expected. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=95.36s)]
*  Now, let's see what this new government could do. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  But it's very clear that when you look at how this vote sort of breaks down, there's not a lot of love for the political system here in Britain. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=105.36s)]
*  There's a lot of anger as well. And that is something this new prime minister and this new government will have to deal with. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=114.0s)]
*  Lindsay. So that said, what happens now? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=120.08s)]
*  Well, unlike in America where you have a transition period of around two months and then a big inauguration, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=122.0s)]
*  here all of the choreography of one leader going out and another one coming in has already happened. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=130.16000000000003s)]
*  You actually saw a bit of it in our introduction. You saw Rishi Sunak standing outside of 10 Downing Street, his wife behind him, where he apologized for the election result, took responsibility for it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=135.68s)]
*  He then went to Buckingham Palace where he resigned, gave his resignation to the king, and then was very quietly ushered out a back door. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=145.68s)]
*  Then you have Keir Starmer, who kind of does the same thing, goes to Buckingham Palace where he then is basically asked to form a government. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=154.32s)]
*  And then he too stands in front of 10 Downing Street with his staff, with his smile, and puts out his plan for the future. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=163.44s)]
*  That choreography is all done. It's now time for him to rule the country in the way that he's promised to. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=172.24s)]
*  Lindsay. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=177.6s)]
*  MTS, thank you so much. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdtjVRMdAgg&t=178.32s)]
