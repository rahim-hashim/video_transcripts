# Family of U.S. prisoner in house in arrest in Iran “incredibly nervous," his sister says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g)
*  We're joined now by Neda Sharkey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=0.0s)]
*  She is the sister of Imad Sharkey, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=2.54s)]
*  one of the four Americans who was recently transferred [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=4.22s)]
*  from Evan prison to house arrest. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=7.24s)]
*  Neda, your brother's a step closer to freedom. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=9.86s)]
*  Have you spoken with him? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=14.86s)]
*  How is he? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=16.82s)]
*  Not only have I spoken to him, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  but I actually saw his face on a video call that he made [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=20.1s)]
*  and I was able to look into his eyes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=25.98s)]
*  I'm happy to say that he's survived, he's alive [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=28.36s)]
*  and we're so hopeful that we can have him at home [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  in our arms, hopefully soon. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=34.8s)]
*  Was that the first time you'd seen his face in some time? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=37.4s)]
*  In about a year, yeah. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=39.92s)]
*  And you know, I looked into his face [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=43.24s)]
*  and I just realized that everything we're doing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  is so worth it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=48.16s)]
*  You know, I looked into the eyes of an innocent American [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=49.2s)]
*  who's been through so much as have the others [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=52.620000000000005s)]
*  and so I'm just grateful for everything that's going on [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=55.34s)]
*  to try and get them home finally. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=59.94s)]
*  And this week has been great, you know, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=62.66s)]
*  but there's just been so much speculation about the deal [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=65.78s)]
*  and the terms of the deal and all of that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=70.1s)]
*  By looking at him, I was reminded [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=72.66s)]
*  that we're talking about people. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  We're talking about innocent Americans [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=75.9s)]
*  and let's just get them home soon. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=77.42s)]
*  The White House said there is still negotiating to do [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  and not everyone is safe yet, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=85.24s)]
*  but September could be when the prisoners return home. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=86.8s)]
*  Do you have any idea when that might be [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=91.44s)]
*  or what happens next? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=94.6s)]
*  You know, my family and I are just on pins, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=96.88s)]
*  like pins and needles. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=102.6s)]
*  We're incredibly nervous about what happens next [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  and we don't know the details. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  I know there's lots of people out there [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=109.38s)]
*  who are speculating. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=111.24s)]
*  I know for a fact that there's someone out there speculating [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=112.46s)]
*  who actually doesn't know anything about what comes next. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=115.64s)]
*  So we just have to continue being optimistic, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  realize that we're dealing with innocent Americans [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=123.0s)]
*  and do everything we can to get them home quickly [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=125.44s)]
*  and, you know, have an American story of celebration [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=128.48s)]
*  when they come home. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=132.0s)]
*  It is so hard when it comes to hostage issues, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=133.76s)]
*  particularly with Iran, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=137.16s)]
*  because it's such a complex challenge for policymakers, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=138.54000000000002s)]
*  but as you just said, you're talking about human beings [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=142.62s)]
*  and families at the other end of it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=145.5s)]
*  So when you hear the criticism of releasing billions [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=147.52s)]
*  of dollars to a regime who did this to your brother [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=151.62s)]
*  and who has done this to others, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=155.02s)]
*  how do you respond when people say, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=158.44s)]
*  you're rewarding bad behavior [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=160.78s)]
*  and they're gonna do it again [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=162.06s)]
*  if you release billions of dollars to Iran? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=163.22s)]
*  You know, I've been advocating for other hostages [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=165.72s)]
*  and wrongful detainees in my role [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=168.08s)]
*  on the Bring Our Families Home campaign. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=170.56s)]
*  I have seen families struggle and suffer. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=172.88s)]
*  I know the devastation that families go through [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=177.48s)]
*  as they're trying to bring their loved ones home. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=181.8s)]
*  I'm in that position myself right now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=183.56s)]
*  We can have discussions about how to prevent this [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=186.56s)]
*  from happening in the future, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=190.2s)]
*  but we don't do that on the backs of innocent Americans. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=191.96s)]
*  We need to bring them home. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=195.4s)]
*  And then we can have discussions [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=196.86s)]
*  about how we can prevent this in the future. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  And you even heard Chairman Turner say [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=200.72000000000003s)]
*  he's not against bringing home Americans, innocent Americans. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  They should come home. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=207.44000000000003s)]
*  We should do whatever we can to bring my brother home [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=208.52s)]
*  to his parents, to his wife, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  to his lovely two daughters who you have met. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=213.44000000000003s)]
*  And then let's sit and have the discussions that we need [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  about how we can prevent this from happening again. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=219.44000000000003s)]
*  Your family has been on this program [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=222.84s)]
*  begging for an audience with President Biden, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=225.3s)]
*  begging for more attention. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=228.1s)]
*  What do you think about what the administration has done? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=230.8s)]
*  I wish they had done it sooner, but they're doing it now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=234.62s)]
*  I want them to finish this and bring my brother home, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=238.58s)]
*  let my aging parents see him before it's too late. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=241.82s)]
*  And I want them to work on bringing other Americans home. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  We need their help. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  They need to do it faster. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=252.7s)]
*  And I want them to work on bringing other Americans home too. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=255.38s)]
*  Should there be a ban on travel for Americans to Iran? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=258.26s)]
*  I think that- [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=263.54s)]
*  It's hard when you have family. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=264.96s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=267.34s)]
*  Look, my brother went to Iran [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=268.18s)]
*  after his two daughters graduated high school [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=270.86s)]
*  and he was an empty nester. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=273.38s)]
*  And like thousands of other Americans [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=274.94s)]
*  with Iranian heritage went back as a tourist. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=277.74s)]
*  I don't want to prevent people from doing that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=281.58s)]
*  But the reality is we need to sit down together [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=284.02s)]
*  both sides of the aisle and come up with ways [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=287.22s)]
*  that we can prevent this from happening again. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=289.9s)]
*  But again, I say this, Margaret, we do that, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=293.14s)]
*  but we don't do that on the backs of innocent Americans [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=296.24s)]
*  who are currently held hostage abroad. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=299.02s)]
*  Every single one of these hostages, my brother included, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=301.26s)]
*  has a family waiting for him, for them. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=305.06s)]
*  And they need to be brought home. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=308.02s)]
*  And those discussions about prevention and deterrence [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=309.6s)]
*  can and should happen after they're home. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=312.68s)]
*  Well, we will continue following that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=316.48s)]
*  as well as your brother, and we wish you well. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=318.92s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=321.4s)]
*  Thank you for sharing your story at this sensitive time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=322.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlibwQio3g&t=325.24s)]
