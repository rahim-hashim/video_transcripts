# The foreign policy outlook for 2023
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY)
*  For a look at what's ahead on the foreign policy front, we're joined by the former U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=0.0s)]
*  ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, CBS News national security contributor Michael Morell, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=4.0s)]
*  former Obama administration undersecretary of defense for policy Michelle Flournoy, and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=10.28s)]
*  former Trump administration national security adviser General H.R. McMaster, who joins us [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=14.32s)]
*  from Palo Alto. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=19.32s)]
*  It's good to have all of you here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  You know, February 24th, 2022 was a wake-up call for the world on the national security [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=24.2s)]
*  front. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=31.16s)]
*  And Ambassador Sullivan, I know you were posted to Moscow at the time. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=32.16s)]
*  European nations really didn't believe the United States was going to happen, and then [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=36.8s)]
*  it did. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=40.4s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=41.4s)]
*  We knew it was going to happen. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=42.4s)]
*  We'd been predicting it for months. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=43.4s)]
*  I'd spoken to Secretary Blinken just a few days before on February 19th, and he asked [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=45.6s)]
*  me what the mood was. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=50.4s)]
*  And I said it felt like August 31st, 1939, a world leader was going to launch an aggressive [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=51.52s)]
*  war on the European continent with unknown consequences. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  I then thought, jeez, I hope I haven't overstated this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=63.28s)]
*  But we were very confident in our assessment about what he was going to do. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=66.64s)]
*  The only question was when. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  But what was so surreal as a reporter was that all of our allies were doubting that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=71.80000000000001s)]
*  Vladimir Putin would do this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=77.64s)]
*  I spent a lot of time talking to fellow ambassadors in Moscow, the U.S. business community in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=79.84s)]
*  Moscow. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=86.44s)]
*  They said, oh, you're chicken little, the sky is falling. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=87.44s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  This is irrational. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Putin would never do it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Those same people on February 25th were texting me on their way to the airport saying goodbye. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=94.68s)]
*  I was right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  To date, sanctions have not stopped Vladimir Putin, and he is making clear that this war [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=102.68s)]
*  is going to continue. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=109.04s)]
*  And that has global ramifications. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=110.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=111.76s)]
*  I think in 2023, we're likely to see minimal Russian gains on the military battlefield, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=112.76s)]
*  but more of Putin's spoiler campaign where he's using missiles and drones to take out [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=120.0s)]
*  civilian infrastructure, target electricity, target water supplies, really trying to break [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  the will of the Ukrainian people, while also hoping that Europe has a very cold, dark winter [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=130.16s)]
*  and the energy prices, the risk of a recession. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=137.12s)]
*  He's seeking to break the will of the Ukrainians and of NATO. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't think he's going to be successful. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  I think in 2023, we're either going to see some kind of escalation on Putin's side and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=146.52s)]
*  or possibly both some entry into some negotiations if, in fact, the Western and Ukrainian will [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  holds and Putin realizes he can't actually achieve his objective. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=161.36s)]
*  So he wants to put lipstick on a pig and declare victory somehow. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=165.44s)]
*  General McMaster, Vladimir Putin just recently visited a military outpost for the first time [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=170.6s)]
*  with his generals. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=176.52s)]
*  Some have read that as an indication that he is doubling down. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=178.9s)]
*  What do you see happening here? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=183.28s)]
*  Some Ukrainian generals are forecasting a Russian offensive could begin as soon as January. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=185.56s)]
*  I think that's likely to be the case, Margaret, but it's going to fail. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=192.24s)]
*  I mean, Putin is in denial. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  He's a man who's always been obsessed, right, obsessed with restoring Russia to national [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  greatness and he fancied himself as the new czar presiding over an expanding Russian empire. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=200.52s)]
*  Well, he's failed utterly, but he's increasingly isolated. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=205.84s)]
*  You know, Putin, he's kind of a street thug. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=208.8s)]
*  I mean, he's a bully and a coward at the same time. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  I think now we have agency, Margaret. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  We can stop meeting out assistance. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=218.36s)]
*  We can give Ukrainians what they need to protect their population and their infrastructure [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=219.96s)]
*  and to sustain a counteroffensive to regain at least the territories taken since the renewed [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  offensive on February 24th. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  Mike Morell, I want to know what you think the red line is. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=233.24s)]
*  From what I hear, it's Crimea. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  That if the Ukrainians tried to retake that area, that that might lead to the escalation [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=240.72000000000003s)]
*  that you were just referring to. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=246.28s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that and the contact the CIA is having with Russian intelligence? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=248.4s)]
*  So Crimea is the most important piece for Putin, right, in terms of what he's taken [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=253.76s)]
*  since 2014. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=258.28s)]
*  But I'm not sure what that escalation could look like. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't have a lot left from a military perspective. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  His troops, in matter of fact, are digging in to defensive positions in eastern Ukraine [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=269.36s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=274.12s)]
*  I'm not sure what he can do, what he has left in his bag if the Ukrainians were to go into [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=275.12s)]
*  Crimea. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=281.48s)]
*  And I would not dissuade them from doing that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  Director Burns did have contact. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  He met face to face with his Russian counterpart. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=287.44s)]
*  I mean, the intelligence channels are open. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=290.24s)]
*  They're open. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=292.88s)]
*  But when you hear escalation, people fear Vladimir Putin's nuclear arsenal. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=293.88s)]
*  What is the probability of it being used? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=299.1s)]
*  So I hope that part of the communication, right, between Director Burns and his counterparts [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=301.68s)]
*  in Russia are, here is what the United States will do if you were to use a nuclear weapon [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=308.48s)]
*  or biological weapons on the battlefield. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=313.84s)]
*  And I hope that we've sent a message that our response would be significant and consequential. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=316.12s)]
*  What does significant look like? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=321.8s)]
*  I think what it looks like is U.S. forces attacking Russian forces inside Ukraine. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=323.96s)]
*  I think that would force Vladimir Putin to think twice. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  I think the international dimension is important here. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=332.96s)]
*  I mean, Putin is pretty isolated, but you've had the prime minister of India come out and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=335.6s)]
*  say, we don't want to see nuclear weapons used. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=340.0s)]
*  You've had Xi Jinping, probably Putin's closest ally, come out and be very clear that nuclear [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=342.6s)]
*  weapons should not be used. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=348.72s)]
*  So I think Putin would also find him incredibly isolated, not only from the West, but from [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  much of the international community as well. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=356.32000000000005s)]
*  Ambassador Sullivan, does Putin care that he's isolated? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=360.6s)]
*  We made the same arguments to him to not invade Ukraine, that it'd be isolated, that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=362.9s)]
*  the consequences would be devastating. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=366.9s)]
*  That turned out to be true. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=369.17999999999995s)]
*  141 countries condemned and deplored the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in the General Assembly [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=370.5s)]
*  just after it occurred. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=378.17999999999995s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=380.02s)]
*  He's got his plan. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=381.41999999999996s)]
*  He's going to regather the Russian lands. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=382.41999999999996s)]
*  His response would be, Peter the Great didn't care what other leaders thought. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=385.02s)]
*  Peter the Great did what he needed to do to gather the Russian lands, this mythic in some [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=390.98s)]
*  sense in his own mind, Russian empire that he wants to restore. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=395.74s)]
*  He's messianic. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=400.82s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=401.9s)]
*  Well that's terrifying. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=404.06s)]
*  I want to take a very quick break because we have so many more national security issues [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=406.82s)]
*  to continue to talk about. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=411.0s)]
*  We'll be back with more of our panel. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=412.65999999999997s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=415.1s)]
*  And we continue our conversation now with our foreign policy panel. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=416.1s)]
*  H.R. McMaster, General McMaster, I want to ask you from a military perspective. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=420.54s)]
*  We heard the CIA director describe a full-fledged military partnership between Russia and Iran. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=425.7s)]
*  What does this look like? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=434.68s)]
*  Well, I think where it heads next is support for Russia's war-making machine more broadly. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=435.94s)]
*  I think you're going to see missiles. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=440.94s)]
*  You already have reports of Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps trainers and assemblers of these [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=442.54s)]
*  drones. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=448.26s)]
*  I think what we're recognizing is these problem sets that we're facing with the theocratic [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=449.78s)]
*  dictatorship in Iran and the revanchist hyper-nationalist Putin, they're connected to each other and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=454.02s)]
*  they're connected to China. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=459.46s)]
*  So I think we are hopefully now in full recognition that we are in really consequential competitions [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=460.65999999999997s)]
*  with authoritarian regimes who are hostile to us. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=467.18s)]
*  And we have to respond much more effectively than we responded in the past. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=470.7s)]
*  And that's a broad range of, I think, preparations for potential military conflicts so we can [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=474.5s)]
*  deter a widening of the war. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=478.86s)]
*  But there's also very significant economic and diplomatic aspects of these interconnected [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=481.02000000000004s)]
*  problems. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=486.06s)]
*  One of the things you're saying there is recognize that the attempt to broker a nuclear [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=487.06s)]
*  deal with Iran is dead. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=492.38s)]
*  It's a pipe dream. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=495.42s)]
*  You know, it's trying to revive something that is completely dead. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=496.42s)]
*  And I couldn't believe it, Margaret, as we were supplicating to the Iranian regime as [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=499.3s)]
*  they're intensifying their proxy war in the region and attacking some of our of our longstanding [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=504.38s)]
*  partners there. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=509.98s)]
*  And I think we lost a lot of ground in the Middle East because of we're chasing this [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  pipe dream, trying to revive this this nuclear agreement. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=514.86s)]
*  And if we didn't, what would happen is we'd give Iran a pass on on the destructive effect [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=519.24s)]
*  the dictatorship has had on the Iranian economy. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=524.18s)]
*  If we're going to be in the business of making predictions, I think the chances are quite [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=527.38s)]
*  high of a significant conflict in the Middle East, maybe entailing an Israeli strike on [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=531.02s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=537.62s)]
*  But Michelle, do you agree with that assessment? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=538.62s)]
*  The real risk is that in 2023, they will acquire enough material and highly enriched nuclear [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=540.98s)]
*  material to build a bomb. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=547.18s)]
*  Israel has long articulated that as a red line, that that is an unacceptable condition [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=550.06s)]
*  for them to have to coexist with. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=554.54s)]
*  And then the decision that places on the president, the U.S. president's desk, do we support them? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=558.52s)]
*  Do we stand back? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=565.12s)]
*  What happens? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=567.04s)]
*  And do we find ourselves in an escalating situation with Iran in the Middle East? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=568.04s)]
*  And Mike, the intelligence community has not determined that Iran actually will make a [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=573.96s)]
*  nuclear weapon. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=578.72s)]
*  It's just that they're giving themselves the possibility to do so at a future date. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=579.72s)]
*  The judgment has always been that what the Iranians want is to get to the threshold, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=584.08s)]
*  right, to have all the pieces and be able to put them together quickly. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=589.4000000000001s)]
*  Right now, they have enough fissile material enriched to 60 percent for four bombs, and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=594.44s)]
*  they could get to 90 percent, which is what is required for a weapon, in a matter of weeks. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=601.2s)]
*  So in terms of fissile material piece, they're very, very close. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=606.44s)]
*  Does the regime, which has withstood many popular protests, withstand what's happening [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=610.76s)]
*  in the streets, which is unique with these protests that were started by young women? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=616.3199999999999s)]
*  I think you have to look at the current protest in the context of a series of protests that [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=621.52s)]
*  have occurred since 2017. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=626.56s)]
*  They've all had different causes, but the one thing they have in common is a growing [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=628.24s)]
*  alienation of the young people from the regime and a growing group of people who want a more [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=632.48s)]
*  normal life and a less rigid life. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=639.68s)]
*  But at the same time, there's a large number of Iranians who support the regime, 18 million [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=642.2399999999999s)]
*  people voted for the current president, who's a hardliner. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=647.68s)]
*  So I don't think that we're going to see regime change unless there's an incident that [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=650.5999999999999s)]
*  takes us in a different direction. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=655.3399999999999s)]
*  It is so fascinating that the dynamic is there, that it's women who started this round of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=657.02s)]
*  protests. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=661.3599999999999s)]
*  And it makes me think, Michelle, of time and again, as expected, it is the young women [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=662.3599999999999s)]
*  who are paying the price for what's happening in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=668.96s)]
*  the United States. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=672.88s)]
*  Do you buy the argument that that choice to withdraw factored in in any way to Russia [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=673.88s)]
*  and China's assessment that the U.S. was in decline? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  It's one brick in a wall that they've been building for quite some time that has many [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=684.56s)]
*  bricks, which is why it's so important that we need to invest in our alliances, really [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=689.92s)]
*  demonstrate our credibility when we make foreign policy commitments and so forth. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=698.1600000000001s)]
*  I actually would give the administration some credit for that in terms of pulling NATO together [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=702.1600000000001s)]
*  after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, building stronger partnerships in Asia to try to deter [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=707.1600000000001s)]
*  and counterbalance China. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=714.2s)]
*  Are you optimistic that those alliances in the West will actually remain solid? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=715.76s)]
*  Because there is an argument that if Vladimir Putin hadn't bombed Kiev and terrified European [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=722.2800000000001s)]
*  leaders that that they wouldn't be united. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=727.94s)]
*  That it's not just diplomacy. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=731.0600000000001s)]
*  It was actual fear. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=732.0600000000001s)]
*  But we are where we are. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=733.58s)]
*  And I think the NATO alliance and the U.S.-EU relationship, they have found their purpose [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=735.22s)]
*  again. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=741.62s)]
*  There's a tremendous amount of transatlantic unity that I think is quite solid. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=742.62s)]
*  I also think as Beijing overplays their hand, that actually bolsters our alliances and our [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=746.4200000000001s)]
*  partnerships in the region. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=754.1400000000001s)]
*  We have to play our cards well and seriously compete not only diplomatically, but shoring [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=756.34s)]
*  up deterrents militarily, competing economically, technologically, keeping our edge, making [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=762.8s)]
*  the right investments at home. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=768.34s)]
*  Ambassador Sullivan, you're not at the State Department anymore, so you can speak freely. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=769.98s)]
*  How much of the withdrawal, how it was executed and the agreement with the Taliban is responsible [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=774.86s)]
*  for shaping the perception of weakness of the West? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=779.34s)]
*  I completely agree with Michelle that the Russians, Beijing, they will use any misstep [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=782.9s)]
*  by the United States, real or imagined, against us in their false narrative. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=788.22s)]
*  Unfortunately, in this case, we did make a major misstep, I think, particularly in how [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=793.5s)]
*  we implemented the withdrawal. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=798.5s)]
*  There's no doubt in my mind that it factored in at least in some way in the Russians' calculation [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=801.02s)]
*  about our strength, our ability to convince allies and partners to oppose what the Russians [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=807.1s)]
*  were doing, our credibility. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=813.9399999999999s)]
*  Did it ultimately turn out to be the case? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=816.34s)]
*  No. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=818.9399999999999s)]
*  As with so many things, Putin was wrong about that too. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=819.9399999999999s)]
*  Mike, after the fall of Kabul, you were on this program and you correctly forecast that [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=822.46s)]
*  the Taliban knew where al-Qaeda's leader was inside Afghanistan. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=826.9s)]
*  So I'm wondering what your thought is about where the emerging terror threat is now. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=832.98s)]
*  So al-Qaeda is a problem that needs to be watched in Afghanistan. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=837.7s)]
*  The bigger problem in Afghanistan at the moment is ISIS. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=841.9000000000001s)]
*  They are increasingly recruiting from neighboring countries and those individuals are coming [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=845.3000000000001s)]
*  in where they're getting training from ISIS. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=850.22s)]
*  And the concern is that they might leave Afghanistan, go back to their home countries and conduct [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=852.5400000000001s)]
*  attacks against Western interests, think embassies. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=857.1s)]
*  The bigger terrorism problem is actually in Africa, all the way from Somalia all the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=861.34s)]
*  way to West Africa, where you've got both al-Qaeda affiliates and you've got ISIS affiliates. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=865.26s)]
*  They have control, huge swaths of territory. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=871.7s)]
*  They've conducted primarily local attacks so far, but at some point, Western embassies, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=875.0600000000001s)]
*  Western military bases in both Africa and possibly in Europe could become targets. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=880.5400000000001s)]
*  And if we're going to make a prediction for 2023, I'd say we're going to see a terrorist [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=884.9s)]
*  attack against a Western interest somewhere in the world. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=889.62s)]
*  Well that's terrifying. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=893.94s)]
*  It's sobering. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=897.0600000000001s)]
*  It's a reminder that declaring victory was too early. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=898.0600000000001s)]
*  Terrorism has always waxed and waned. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=902.44s)]
*  It has always gone up and down. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=904.22s)]
*  And I think it's starting to bounce back again. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=905.9s)]
*  General McMaster, do you agree with that assessment that the emerging threat is coming out of [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=909.38s)]
*  Africa? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=914.1s)]
*  I do, but it's also coming out of Afghanistan. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=915.1s)]
*  It's also coming out of the Middle East still. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=918.46s)]
*  And ISIS in Syria has not been defeated. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=922.0600000000001s)]
*  And the main lesson from 9-11 is that threats, jihadist threats that develop abroad can only [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=924.9000000000001s)]
*  be dealt with at an exorbitant cost once they reach our shores. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=931.34s)]
*  So sustained engagement through partners, like the partners we abandoned in Afghanistan, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=935.12s)]
*  is really critical to our own safety and security. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=942.38s)]
*  I want to transition to the other looming threat that you hear the administration saying [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=945.3399999999999s)]
*  it will turn its eye towards in the new year, and that is China. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=951.8599999999999s)]
*  Michelle Flournoy, where do you begin to try to de-escalate? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=956.02s)]
*  Well, I think there is a desire to sort of right the apple cart. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=959.14s)]
*  That said, neither side is going to change its fundamental interests. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=963.38s)]
*  And those interests are in many ways in conflict. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=968.3399999999999s)]
*  So there is a competition ongoing, and it's economic, it's technological, it's informational, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=971.66s)]
*  it's political, it's military. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=978.2199999999999s)]
*  I think the real name of the game in 2023 is shoring up deterrence. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=980.2199999999999s)]
*  I don't think President Xi wants to move on Taiwan. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=985.62s)]
*  He's got, you know, COVID to deal with. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=988.62s)]
*  He's got a youth unemployment problem to deal with. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=991.14s)]
*  He's got all kinds of domestic challenges. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=993.6999999999999s)]
*  And I think he'd prefer to take Taiwan using economic and political coercion, ultimately. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=997.46s)]
*  But he has instructed his military, be ready by 2027. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1002.74s)]
*  So we've got the next few years to really make sure that he cannot have confidence in [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1007.0600000000001s)]
*  his ability to succeed militarily. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1012.74s)]
*  So that means we have a lot of investment to do alongside investing in the drivers of [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1015.0600000000001s)]
*  our economic competitiveness, our technological competitiveness as well. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1020.22s)]
*  Mr. Sullivan, how does Secretary Blinken approach this sort of trying to defrost this frozen relationship? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1025.34s)]
*  We're not going to do this alone. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1033.06s)]
*  We just saw the Japanese government announcing its new national security and defense strategy, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1034.7s)]
*  significantly increasing its defense budget. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1040.62s)]
*  Are European allies and partners becoming more forthright about the threat that they [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1044.86s)]
*  see, the challenges they see from China? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1048.94s)]
*  I want to get to General McMaster, because I know you spend a lot of time on thinking [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1053.54s)]
*  about China. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1057.26s)]
*  How do you see it? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1058.68s)]
*  It's a grave threat. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1060.02s)]
*  I think Xi Jinping means what he says, right? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1061.02s)]
*  I think we have to be careful not to mirror image, not to fall into the same traps we [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1062.94s)]
*  did with Vladimir Putin of confirmation bias and optimism bias. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1067.54s)]
*  Xi Jinping has made quite clear in his statements that he's going to make, from his perspective, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1071.78s)]
*  China whole again by subsuming Taiwan. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1076.5s)]
*  And the preparations are underway. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1079.32s)]
*  So I think what is important is what Michelle said, deterrence, but good old fashioned deterrence [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1081.26s)]
*  by denial. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1086.22s)]
*  I mean, hard power matters. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1087.22s)]
*  And I think we are under-invested in defense in the United States. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1089.82s)]
*  China has become increasingly aggressive, not only from an economic and financial perspective [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1093.3s)]
*  and a wolf war diplomacy perspective, but physically with its military. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1098.26s)]
*  And what's really disturbing is I think Xi Jinping is preparing the Chinese people for [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1103.74s)]
*  war. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1108.46s)]
*  In one of his speeches, he said, well, for us to restore China to national greatness, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1109.46s)]
*  it's going to take some sacrifices. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1113.1000000000001s)]
*  So I think we have to take it very seriously and act to extend really our power. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1115.5s)]
*  We talk a lot about relying on our allies, and then maybe if we take a step back, the [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1121.8600000000001s)]
*  allies will do more. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1126.74s)]
*  I think actually the opposite is the case. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1127.94s)]
*  If Americans just do a little bit more, many of our allies will follow suit and bolster [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1130.22s)]
*  their defense capabilities and capacity as well. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1135.3s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6I_5eC9fXY&t=1139.04s)]
