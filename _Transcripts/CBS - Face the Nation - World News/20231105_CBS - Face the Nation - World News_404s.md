# Israeli ambassador for U.S. says Hamas is "playing for time" in releasing the hostages
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8)
*  We turn now to the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=0.0s)]
*  Michael Herzog. Ambassador, good to have you here in person. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=3.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=6.24s)]
*  It's hard to believe it's been a month since we last spoke in the wake of the horrific attack on [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=7.28s)]
*  your country. I want to tap into some of your experience here because before you were a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=12.32s)]
*  diplomat, you were in the military. The White House said on Friday, in the coming week, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=18.48s)]
*  the Israeli military will have more of a tactical focus on the ground campaign to clear out specific [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=22.96s)]
*  areas. Are we moving into a new phase of this war? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=29.36s)]
*  So let me explain what we're up against. Gaza is probably the biggest terror complex in the world. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  You have tens of thousands of armed terrorists, tens of thousands of rockets. We estimate over [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  500 kilometers of tunnels, terror tunnels, with rockets, all their leadership, command and control [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=46.56s)]
*  structure. This is what we're up against and we have to uproot it because if we do not, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=53.68s)]
*  they will strike again and again. They're saying it publicly. This is a very complicated military [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=59.04s)]
*  operation in a densely populated area and we're trying to move the population away from that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=65.76s)]
*  war zone. We are moving very slowly, very deliberately, but we are, our operation, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=73.44s)]
*  we believe, is effective and will continue. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=81.84s)]
*  There are still 400,000 people in the north of Gaza, according to the U.S. The area you say [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=84.4s)]
*  you're trying to clear out. But your military hasn't circled Gaza City. It has killed a lot of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=89.36s)]
*  leaders of Hamas and praised that as success. So at what point do you declare success and at what [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=96.0s)]
*  point do you stop this aerial campaign and move into more strategic tactics? First of all, most of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  our campaign right now is carried out by ground forces. It's not an air campaign. That was the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=111.04s)]
*  first phase. Now we, I'm not going to put a time frame on this war. We did not stop, start this war. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=115.84s)]
*  We did not want this war, but we cannot stop before we dismantle this terror machine or else, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=124.4s)]
*  as I said, will strike again and again. And we have to make sure that when this ends, they are [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=130.24s)]
*  unable to strike again the way they did on October 7th. I think everybody in Israel is united around [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=136.72s)]
*  this goal. Your prime minister said no ceasefire without the return of hostages. How close [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  are we in those negotiations to get hostages freed? We are making every effort to get hostages [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  released. And when people talk about pause in the fighting, we are all for a pause that would [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=159.76s)]
*  allow for the release of hostages. Unfortunately, I'll explain the humanitarian issue, but [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=167.44s)]
*  unfortunately, it is not our impression that Hamas is serious about releasing them. They are playing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=174.56s)]
*  for time. They're trying to stop our pressure and rearm and regroup themselves. When we see that they [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=179.68s)]
*  are serious about it, then we're all in. Nobody has to urge us. Most of the kidnaps are Israelis, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=188.24s)]
*  and our government is responsible to the families. So nobody has to urge us on this. But the White [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=195.28s)]
*  House has said it was a test case and a successful one to have those two Americans and then those two [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=200.72s)]
*  Israelis released. Why do you think hostage talks are not successful now? Because Hamas is playing [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=204.72s)]
*  for time, because Hamas is trying to stop our military efforts. And I think the more pressure [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  we put on them, the more chances there are that they may agree to release hostages. So according to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=215.68s)]
*  the U.S., there's 400,000 people stuck in north of Gaza. There are thousands of Palestinian civilian [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  casualties. This is according to the White House National Security Adviser, 70 or more UN workers, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=229.36s)]
*  30 or more journalists who have been killed. Will your military change tactics as the U.S. has asked? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=234.56s)]
*  We are making every effort to distinguish between terrorists and civilian population. We call the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=242.72s)]
*  civilian population to move to the south out of harm's way. And Hamas is doing everything they can [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=248.16s)]
*  to keep them in harm's way. Most of the population move to the south. And as we speak and we are [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=254.72s)]
*  pressuring pressing Hamas in the north, we are calling people to move out of harm's way. I would [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=260.8s)]
*  be very careful, very careful about judging those numbers because neither you nor I know [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=266.96s)]
*  how many of them are armed terrorists and how many of them are civilians. I don't know and you don't [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=273.84s)]
*  know. Let me tell you one, let me tell you more than that. On October 7th, Hamas attacked us with [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=279.04s)]
*  3,000 armed terrorists. We're still collecting the bodies. We have 1,000 bodies of armed terrorists on [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=285.2s)]
*  our grid. Do they count them in their numbers or no? I don't know and you don't know. So let's be [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=292.24s)]
*  very careful about that because I don't know how many of them are terrorists and how many. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=297.44s)]
*  Our military says that it kills numerous terrorists in armed clashes. So let's be very careful about [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=301.6s)]
*  that. Okay, well you just heard that the U.S., one of the U.S. National Security Advisers raising [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=308.8s)]
*  concerns here. In terms of national security interest, there is that question of unintended [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=314.56s)]
*  consequences, right? And that if you, we know from polling that there are a lot of people in [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=320.8s)]
*  Gaza who didn't support Hamas, but now with this campaign, this brutal, with these number of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=327.76s)]
*  casualties, there is the risk of radicalization of that population. How concerned are you about that? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=333.12s)]
*  We are. In every war, there are unintended consequences and there's collateral damage. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=339.68s)]
*  That's tragic. Every human life is tragic, Palestinian or Israeli, it doesn't matter. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=345.76s)]
*  We act according to international law. We make every distinction that we can make between civilians [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=351.36s)]
*  and terrorists. But is there an end point? Now we call the population to move to the south, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=358.56s)]
*  to keep them out of harm's way. Before we did airstrikes, we called specific families, buildings, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=364.4s)]
*  asked them to leave. And Hamas is deliberately keeping them. And in part of our clashes in Gaza, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=371.2s)]
*  they sent like a hundred civilians to face our forces. That's the way they operate. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=377.36s)]
*  This is tragic. This is tragic. But we cannot allow Hamas immunity just because they hide behind [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=383.52s)]
*  civilians. We want to separate between the two and strike the terrorists. Ambassador, there is a lot [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=389.84s)]
*  more to talk to you about. Unfortunately, I have to leave it there for today. But I hope that we [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  will have you back to continue covering this. Thank you very much. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSoq3Uduo8&t=400.72s)]
