# White House pressed on Gaza plan after Trump makes takeover announcement
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo)
*  The president is committed to eliminating Hamas and securing a lasting peace for the entire region. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=0.0s)]
*  The historic proposal for the United States to take over Gaza announced by President Trump last night underscores this commitment. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=8.0s)]
*  Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=17.0s)]
*  President Trump is an outside of the box thinker and a visionary leader who solves problems that many others, especially in this city, claim are unsolvable. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=23.0s)]
*  We've already seen the results from President Trump's bold, peace through strength diplomacy on the world stage. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=33.0s)]
*  Garrett, great to see you here today. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=39.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=41.0s)]
*  On Gaza, the president has spent basically his entire public career criticizing foreign entanglements, nation building, sending American troops to fight abroad, particularly in the Middle East. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=42.0s)]
*  This plan seems like it could ultimately involve all of those things. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=54.0s)]
*  Can you explain this reversal and how building and owning Gaza squares with America first foreign policy? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=58.0s)]
*  I would reject the premise of your question that this forces the United States to be entangled in conflicts abroad. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=65.0s)]
*  The president has not committed to putting boots on the ground in Gaza. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=71.0s)]
*  He has also said that the United States is not going to pay for the rebuilding of Gaza. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=75.0s)]
*  His administration is going to work with our partners in the region to reconstruct this region. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=80.0s)]
*  And let me just take a step back here because this is an out of the box idea. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=86.0s)]
*  That's who President Trump is. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=91.0s)]
*  That's why the American people elected him. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=92.0s)]
*  And his goal is lasting peace in the Middle East for all people in the region. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=94.0s)]
*  And as I said in my opening remarks, we've had the same people pushing the same solutions to this problem for decades. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=100.0s)]
*  And it's been very made very clear to the president that the United States needs to be revolved involved in this rebuilding effort to ensure stability in the region for all people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=107.0s)]
*  But that does not mean boots on the ground in Gaza. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=118.0s)]
*  It does not mean American taxpayers will be funding this effort. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=121.0s)]
*  It means Donald Trump, who is the best dealmaker on the planet, is going to strike a deal with our partners in the region. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=123.0s)]
*  He did not rule out American troops in Gaza last night. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=129.0s)]
*  Are you doing that now? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=132.0s)]
*  I am saying that the president has not committed to that just yet. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=133.0s)]
*  He has not made that commitment. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=137.0s)]
*  And you know that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=138.0s)]
*  And on the foreign partners, the Jordanians, the Egyptians, the Saudis have already panned this plan. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=139.0s)]
*  What foreign partners, if any, have expressed any interest in being part of this? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=144.0s)]
*  Well, the president has said he's been socialing this idea for quite some time. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=148.0s)]
*  He's been thinking about this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=151.0s)]
*  He said in his remarks last night this was not a decision or an announcement that he takes lightly. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=152.0s)]
*  And the president has already spoken to the president, Al Sisi. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=158.0s)]
*  In fact, that was his first foreign leader call. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=162.0s)]
*  He's meeting with the king of Jordan, King Abdullah, next week. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=164.0s)]
*  He spoke with the king of Bahrain. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=167.0s)]
*  He spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=169.0s)]
*  And he has made it very clear. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=172.0s)]
*  He's been very vocal that he expects our partners in the region, particularly Egypt and Jordan, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=174.0s)]
*  to accept Palestinian refugees temporarily so that we can rebuild their home. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=179.0s)]
*  I'd like to show you some images of Gaza that were taken. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=184.0s)]
*  Fox News aired this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=188.0s)]
*  I mean, that is, as they put it, an apocalyptic scene in Gaza. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=189.0s)]
*  This is an unhabitable place for human beings. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=194.0s)]
*  Do you really think that families can live their dream in a region that looks like this, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=198.0s)]
*  with no running water, no electricity? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=203.0s)]
*  And the special envoy to the president, Steve Witkoff, recently traveled to Gaza, as you all know. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=206.0s)]
*  And he came back with images that he showed the president of the dire situation here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=211.0s)]
*  And the president made this decision with a humanitarian heart for all people in the region. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=215.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=221.0s)]
*  The president and you here again today have made clear, given the devastation you think Palestinians have, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=222.0s)]
*  that there's no choice but to leave Gaza and go elsewhere. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=227.0s)]
*  But Palestinians say this is their home. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=230.0s)]
*  They don't want to go. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=232.0s)]
*  The president last night said he's willing to use the military if necessary. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=233.0s)]
*  Is the U.S. prepared to remove Palestinians from Gaza by force? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=237.0s)]
*  The president is prepared to rebuild Gaza for Palestinians and all people in the region, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=241.0s)]
*  peace-loving people who want real economic development and opportunity in the region. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=246.0s)]
*  This is a region that has been controlled by Iranian-backed terrorists, Hamas, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=251.0s)]
*  who have brutalized not just Israelis but Palestinians, too. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=256.0s)]
*  It is because of Hamas that you see those images on that screen, that Gaza has become a demolition site, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=259.0s)]
*  because Hamas launched that brutal attack on Israel on October the 7th. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=265.0s)]
*  And so, again, I would stress, President Trump wants to ensure that this can be a place where all people can live in peace. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=269.0s)]
*  He is a peacemaker-in-chief. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=276.0s)]
*  He made that very clear in his first term. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=278.0s)]
*  And as for how that will be accomplished, the president and his team are talking with our allies in the region, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=280.0s)]
*  to consider next steps. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=285.0s)]
*  But should the American people be prepared to see U.S. military on the ground, fighting a ground war against Hamas? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=287.0s)]
*  Again, the president has not committed to U.S. troops in the region. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=292.0s)]
*  But it is an option. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=295.0s)]
*  I have said that the president has not committed to that yet. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=296.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=299.0s)]
*  If I could just follow up on that, though, why not rule out the idea of committing U.S. troops? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=300.0s)]
*  This has been a longstanding argument that the president has made, really, over the last decade or so, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=305.0s)]
*  talking about endless wars and not something the U.S. wants. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=311.0s)]
*  Why not rule out troops? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=314.0s)]
*  Because I think the president is very good when he's making deals and negotiating not to rule out anything [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=315.0s)]
*  because he wants to preserve that leverage in negotiations. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=320.0s)]
*  And so I think that's what he's doing here. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=325.0s)]
*  Mary. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=327.0s)]
*  If I could follow up on that, though, he also said that everyone loves this plan. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=328.0s)]
*  He said that in the Oval Office this morning. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=330.0s)]
*  In fact, the deputy prime minister of Jordan called it the declaration of war on the Arab people. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=332.0s)]
*  So how does he square the fact that even some Republicans on the Hill are objecting to this or questioning this? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=339.0s)]
*  How does he square the fact saying everyone loves this plan? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=344.0s)]
*  Well, King Abdullah of Jordan will be here next week, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=347.0s)]
*  so I can provide you more context on the conversations he will have directly with the president of the United States after that meeting. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=349.0s)]
*  And I would just point out that there's been a lot of leaders and officials all around the world who have doubted, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=356.0s)]
*  I suppose, the dealmaking ability of President Trump. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=361.0s)]
*  You heard the Panama leader saying that he would not agree to some of the concessions that he has now made because of Secretary Rubio's visit. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=364.0s)]
*  You had the Colombian president saying he wouldn't accept flights of Colombian illegal nationals who have entered into our country illegally. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=373.0s)]
*  And those flights are underway. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=379.0s)]
*  So actions speak louder than words. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=381.0s)]
*  Dasha. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=383.0s)]
*  Caroline, you said the president has been working on this idea for a while behind the scenes now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=384.0s)]
*  Is there a written plan based on the president's proposal for Gaza? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=388.0s)]
*  And if so, when was it drafted and who had a hand in that? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=392.0s)]
*  The plan was written in the president's remarks last night as he revealed it to the world and to the American people. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=396.0s)]
*  And his team are continuing to be engaged on this effort. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=401.0s)]
*  I saw the national security adviser this morning. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=404.0s)]
*  He has a very busy day of calls and they will, again, continue to engage with our partners. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=406.0s)]
*  That includes Steve Witkoff as well. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=410.0s)]
*  Tom Boehm with the BBC. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=412.0s)]
*  Can you confirm that under the president's plans for Gaza, any and all Palestinians who want to stay in Gaza on their land will be allowed to do so? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=414.0s)]
*  I can confirm that the president is committed to rebuilding Gaza and to temporarily relocating those who are there because, as I've showed you repeatedly, it is a demolition site. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=423.0s)]
*  There is no running water. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=434.0s)]
*  There is no electricity. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=435.0s)]
*  The president wants these individuals to live in peace. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=436.0s)]
*  He is committed to doing that with this very bold new plan and we will continue to keep you apprised of updates as we receive them. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=439.0s)]
*  Is it worth risking the life of a single US Marine to turn the Gaza Strip into the Riviera of the Middle East? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=446.0s)]
*  Bill, I'm not sure why you're asking me that question because I've already said the president has not committed to sending Marines or any boots on the ground in Gaza. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=452.0s)]
*  Does the president, is he looking at offering anything to these Arab countries that take in Palestinians? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=459.0s)]
*  Is he willing to give them anything in return? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=465.0s)]
*  And secondly, when the president announced his taking over Gaza policy yesterday, was Netanyahu aware of this and what was his reaction when Trump presented that idea to him? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=467.0s)]
*  I was not, I won't get ahead of the president's discussions or negotiations on your first question about what would be offered. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=479.0s)]
*  I think the president's made it clear that he expects these nations in the region to step up and to accept Palestinian refugees who will be temporarily relocated for the rebuilding of Gaza. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=487.0s)]
*  As for whether Prime Minister Netanyahu was aware before the president's remarks, he was indeed. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=498.0s)]
*  I wasn't present for that reaction. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=503.0s)]
*  But again, this is something the president has been socializing and thinking about for quite some time. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=505.0s)]
*  Jeff. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=510.0s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=511.0s)]
*  Two questions. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=512.0s)]
*  One, the president yesterday used the word permanent for permanently resettle Palestinians. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=513.0s)]
*  I hear you saying temporarily today. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=518.0s)]
*  Is that a shift or a specific change that you want to highlight? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=520.0s)]
*  And my second question is, yesterday he spoke about the U.S. owning Gaza. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=525.0s)]
*  Who owns Gaza now and how would the U.S. acquire ownership? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=531.0s)]
*  Well, Gaza is currently run by Iranian-backed terrorists in the Middle East, Hamas, who we all agree, I think everybody in the region agrees, that can no longer stand. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=535.0s)]
*  Just look at the events of October 7th and the events since. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=546.0s)]
*  And the president, again, is committed to rebuilding the region for all people who want to return to it once it is no longer a demolition site. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=549.0s)]
*  And it's a place where people can actually live and thrive in harmony, as he said last night, his words, not mine. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=557.0s)]
*  And permanent versus temporarily resettle? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=564.0s)]
*  Can you just clarify that? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=566.0s)]
*  The president has made it clear that they need to be temporarily relocated out of Gaza for the rebuilding of this effort. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=567.0s)]
*  Again, it's a demolition site right now. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=573.0s)]
*  It's not a livable place for any human being. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=575.0s)]
*  And I think it's actually quite evil to suggest that people should live in such dire conditions. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhEf-HZbKo&t=578.0s)]
