# World Group Bank President David Malpass on “Face the Nation" | Full interview
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM)
*  We now want to welcome David Malpass, president of the World Bank. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=4.44s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=5.84s)]
*  There are a lot of stressors on the global economic system right now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=6.84s)]
*  How do you describe where we are? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=10.9s)]
*  It's a sharp slowdown, including even China. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=12.88s)]
*  So we've seen the world growth fall by half since January in terms of GDP growth, but [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=15.44s)]
*  there's also shortages, there's inflation, and the food shortages for the poorer countries [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=21.76s)]
*  are becoming a significant concern. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=27.64s)]
*  They already are. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=30.12s)]
*  I mean, global inflation, it's not just the U.S. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=31.12s)]
*  It's other wealthy countries around the world, but you're also describing a recipe for global [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=33.84s)]
*  instability. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=39.36s)]
*  It feeds in when there's not enough food for weaker countries, poorer countries, that causes [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=41.52s)]
*  instability, and it's a big factor in the turnover of governments that's been occurring [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=48.72s)]
*  in quite a few of the countries. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=54.44s)]
*  And then there also has to be much more discussion of what to do about the fiscal challenges, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=56.42s)]
*  running out of money for governments as well as food. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  And so these all go together into fragility, very concerning. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=67.54s)]
*  So COVID caused the deepest global recession since World War II. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=71.38s)]
*  Now the world economy is in danger because of this Russian invasion in Ukraine. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=75.98s)]
*  How do you avoid a global recession with all of these factors? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=82.5s)]
*  Some countries, it's going to be very hard to do that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=87.82s)]
*  I think that leadership from the stronger countries is very important. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=90.06s)]
*  There are a lot of possibilities, tools. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=96.38s)]
*  For example, the central banks have many more tools than in 2008. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=99.34s)]
*  You know, there are regulatory tools that they have. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  They now hold huge bond portfolios. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=107.9s)]
*  Those are all funded by money from banks. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=110.7s)]
*  So if there is reduction in the bond portfolios, that frees up capital that could be used for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=114.78s)]
*  these supply chains that are so strained. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=120.58s)]
*  The bottom line is there needs to be lots more production, and that's most available [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=124.9s)]
*  to the strongest countries. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=130.82s)]
*  The U.S. is the world's biggest economy and can increase production more than anybody [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=132.5s)]
*  else. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=137.62s)]
*  So that becomes one of the key variables in the outlook. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=138.62s)]
*  What are you doing today to increase production of everything? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=141.34s)]
*  The world needs practically everything that the U.S. makes, and there needs to be a process [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=144.82s)]
*  to really boost that production. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=150.76s)]
*  So if you were talking to Jerome Powell, the chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, you would [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=152.86s)]
*  say focus less on interest rates, focus more on what? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=156.62s)]
*  He's got multiple tools. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=160.14000000000001s)]
*  One is regulatory policy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  The Fed is an important regulator of banks. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=162.96s)]
*  So let the banks lend more. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=166.48s)]
*  But then also on the bond side, reducing the bond portfolio would return more money to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=168.7s)]
*  banks. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=174.88s)]
*  All of the money being used to hold the bond portfolio comes from banks. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=175.88s)]
*  And if they had more, they could lend. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=179.16s)]
*  And also the non-bank sector of the U.S. economy, that's one of the most innovative, and it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=181.32s)]
*  could put more money into the supply chain. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  It's interesting you say that about the banks. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=190.7s)]
*  I heard something from a U.S. official talking about that as an impediment to oil companies [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=194.10000000000002s)]
*  right now, and President Biden's calling on them to produce more energy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=198.56s)]
*  Is that a problem that you see? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=203.74s)]
*  Big problem, and it's really around the world. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=206.28s)]
*  Markets look ahead, and they look at what the regulatory policy is going to be into [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  the future. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=212.54000000000002s)]
*  So if you're an oil company, you hear the message from all around that the politicians [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  don't want your oil. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=218.84s)]
*  And so then you drill less, you make less of your R&D plans. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=220.72s)]
*  R&D, research and development, is critical to the innovation in every sector. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=228.16s)]
*  In developing countries, they aren't producing energy either, because they're constrained [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=234.86s)]
*  by bank regulations, by the lack of financing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=241.28s)]
*  Even at this meeting of the largest global Western economies, at the G7, there's going [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=245.4s)]
*  to be a focus on sustainability. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  There's going to be a focus on climate change. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  The message there is switch away from fossil fuels. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=255.58s)]
*  But then at the same time, you're hearing Germany build up coal burning once again, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=258.64s)]
*  the United States urging oil and gas production once again because of the crisis with Russia. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=264.04s)]
*  So how do all of these pieces fit together without impacting growth in a negative way? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=269.68s)]
*  There's an inconsistency. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=276.44s)]
*  And it's a moment in time. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=277.44s)]
*  The world's trying to reduce the dependence on Russia and also on China. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=278.98s)]
*  And it needs to keep markets open and not restrict exports and finance the new investments [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=284.04s)]
*  that's needed. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=290.6s)]
*  And there's not clarity in Europe. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=291.92s)]
*  Some of the countries want nuclear power. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=294.04s)]
*  Some want natural gas, and they're talking about importing natural gas. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=296.2s)]
*  But they're doing it slowly so that for the poorer countries in the world, this is also [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=300.4s)]
*  it's a conundrum. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=305.84s)]
*  How are we going to get forward when Europe is drawing in so much of the world's natural [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=307.08s)]
*  gas? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=312.68s)]
*  So a State Department official said a few days ago, food crisis will be at least a three-year [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=313.68s)]
*  problem. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  What time horizon do you put on the food crisis and the energy crisis? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=320.0s)]
*  I'll say one thing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=324.56s)]
*  It's possible to produce enough to soften that crisis. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=325.72s)]
*  But at the rate that we're going right now, the fertilizer isn't being made. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=330.12s)]
*  Fertilizer comes, a giant source of fertilizer is from natural gas through the ammonium channel [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=334.68s)]
*  into the most useful fertilizer. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  And it also is used to make the electricity that converts the minerals into fertilizer. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=344.64000000000004s)]
*  And that's just not happening. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=351.36s)]
*  So a lot of the world is shutting down for lack of fertilizer. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=352.82s)]
*  And then those shortages of crops will last for multiple years. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=356.52s)]
*  We need to break that cycle and do it pretty forcefully now through announcements. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=360.64s)]
*  The markets listen to what the governments are saying. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=365.7s)]
*  And I think if the governments were saying, if the central banks were saying there'll [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=369.2s)]
*  be currency stability, meaning years and years from now, the currencies won't have devalued. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=372.86s)]
*  They won't be causing inflation. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=379.6s)]
*  They're going to be strong and stable for the long term. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=381.8s)]
*  That would go a long way. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=385.6s)]
*  And the same thing on this production side of the economies. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=386.98s)]
*  Say that you want your strong economies to produce twice as much as they are right now. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=391.14s)]
*  That's within reach for many of these innovation techniques. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=397.18s)]
*  But the Federal Reserve chair said this week in this country that recession is certainly [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=401.36s)]
*  a possibility, in part because of higher interest rates. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=405.78000000000003s)]
*  The C group puts the odds of a recession at 50%. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=409.46s)]
*  What's your projection here for the world's most important economy? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=412.35999999999996s)]
*  We put out a report three weeks ago that didn't have the U.S. in recession. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=416.78s)]
*  But we said in downside scenarios there could be. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=421.4s)]
*  And so I don't disagree with those estimates that you're saying there. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=424.94s)]
*  And I would say the key variable is what do you do today to provide more production? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=429.12s)]
*  That addresses both the recession problem and also the inflation problem. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=434.64s)]
*  Because you just push goods into the market and you make it clear to the world we're [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=439.34s)]
*  going to produce so much you won't be able to get that price. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=443.96s)]
*  So do you agree with Fed officials when they say it's going to take at least two years, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=448.64s)]
*  a couple of years before we get inflation back down to 2%? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=453.68s)]
*  It's going to take time to come down. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=457.21999999999997s)]
*  But again, that depends on what's your forecast for oil prices, for natural gas prices, for [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=459.38s)]
*  fertilizer. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=465.26s)]
*  I guess clearly it's going to take months and months and maybe two years to bring inflation [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=466.26s)]
*  back down. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=476.32s)]
*  Markets respond though to signals. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=478.42s)]
*  And so I think the important question is can there be enough signals out of the U.S. but [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=480.48s)]
*  advance the big economies that they're going to provide more production. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=487.02s)]
*  And the reason I keep coming back to that, central banks have a lot to do with whether [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=494.18s)]
*  businesses feel that they can borrow more money. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=499.02s)]
*  It's the regulatory policy, also this control of so many bonds. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=501.85999999999996s)]
*  In Japan, they've bought up a huge part of the national debt. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=507.21999999999997s)]
*  So the central bank takes money from the banking system and buys government bonds. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=511.18s)]
*  That's not adding to supply in Japan. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=517.4s)]
*  So lastly, before I let you go, you have warned on this program before about a debt crisis [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=520.42s)]
*  in these developing countries, the emerging markets. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=524.82s)]
*  With interest rates headed up, is that now where we are? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=527.9s)]
*  Are we at crisis? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=531.66s)]
*  We're at crisis and we see more countries falling in one by one. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=533.14s)]
*  We've seen Sri Lanka and the very grave difficulties there. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=537.7s)]
*  But it's going to be many countries because of, as you say, the interest rates going up [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=541.74s)]
*  and also their GDP going down in this slow growth environment of the world. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=546.9000000000001s)]
*  The solution is a lot more production intent from the advanced economies. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=553.5s)]
*  A perilous moment for the global economy. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=560.62s)]
*  David? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=563.34s)]
*  I just hope we can push through strongly and with confidence. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=565.34s)]
*  Thank you very much for your time. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=569.94s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=570.94s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XBb50rbeM&t=571.94s)]
