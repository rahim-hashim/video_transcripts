# Political gridlock in France after voters reject the far-right
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM)
*  A political scramble in France to thwart the rise of right-wing politicians seems to have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=0.0s)]
*  worked. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=5.88s)]
*  But the country's parliament is at a virtual standstill. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=6.88s)]
*  Last week, after the first round of voting, the far-right national rally appeared headed [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=9.78s)]
*  for a possible majority. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  But going into the second round, which took place over the weekend, the left and center [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=15.88s)]
*  forged a plan to consolidate their support and deny the far-right a chance at power. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=19.76s)]
*  With all the votes counted, a coalition of left-wing groups known as the New Popular [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=26.4s)]
*  Front will claim the most seats in parliament. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  The centrist coalition of President Emmanuel Macron came in second, and the far-right party [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=32.56s)]
*  came in third. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=37.68s)]
*  No group has enough for a governing majority. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=38.76s)]
*  Angela Charlton joins me now from Paris. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=42.16s)]
*  She's the Western Europe News Director for the Associated Press. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=44.36s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=47.54s)]
*  Last week, the far-right was in the lead. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=49.3s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Indeed, a week ago, Marine Le Pen's far-right national rally really dominated the first [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=52.559999999999995s)]
*  round voting. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=58.44s)]
*  But then this left-wing alliance came together really at the last minute. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=59.44s)]
*  It was just a week before the two rounds. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=62.76s)]
*  And they won the most seats in the runoff, which was a surprise to many people, including [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  in that left-wing party. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=68.36s)]
*  And then they were followed by Macron's centrist and then the far-right in third place. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=70.56s)]
*  As you mentioned, this means no one has a majority, which is an unprecedented situation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=74.24s)]
*  in France. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  So Macron will likely try to build a coalition or an alliance of some kind with left-wing, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=80.2s)]
*  moderate left-wing candidates. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=85.4s)]
*  But it will be a challenge, given that no party has a clear majority, and many people [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=88.68s)]
*  do not like Macron. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=93.16s)]
*  And this was because largely of this strategic voting that you mentioned, that's something [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=94.92s)]
*  that France has seen before, but many people thought would no longer happen. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=98.92s)]
*  It's called a Republican frontier, when voters elsewhere on the spectrum all come together [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  to keep the far right from power, sometimes voting for candidates whose views they don't [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  necessarily like, just to keep the far right from power. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=112.94s)]
*  It's such a fascinating collective action move, because often in other political systems, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=117.06s)]
*  maybe even in the United States, people moan that people might have a viewpoint, but they [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=122.9s)]
*  can never actually move quickly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=128.5s)]
*  This seems like an affirmation of Macron's decision to call the snap election. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=131.3s)]
*  Is that a fair way to read it, or is it more subtle than that? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=138.18s)]
*  It's more complicated than that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=142.3s)]
*  You know, on the one hand, OK, a week ago, we thought Macron was going to be wiped out, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=145.18s)]
*  and we'd have the first far-right government in France since the Nazi occupation in World [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=150.26000000000002s)]
*  War II. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=154.46s)]
*  That's obviously not where we are today. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=156.06s)]
*  But if you take a broader look, I mean, Macron's party lost dozens of seats in parliament. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=158.02s)]
*  Marine Le Pen's national rally gained dozens of seats in parliament. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=163.02s)]
*  Macron is really weaker than he's ever been as president. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=167.14000000000001s)]
*  He's heading to NATO this week for a summit, for example, where he is domestically very [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=170.3s)]
*  weakened. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=175.26s)]
*  So we're looking at a complicated situation here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=176.26s)]
*  And some of this, too, I think for voters, really, people looked at this prospect of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=181.18s)]
*  this far-right government and really weren't ready, ultimately, to hand that much power [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=186.26s)]
*  to the national rally, the far right of Marine Le Pen. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  And so, Angela, there is ferment, obviously, even by French standards, to get something [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=196.78s)]
*  done on a set of policy issues. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=201.94s)]
*  Is there one or two particular ones that are important and that will now presumably be [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=203.8s)]
*  harder to address because of the coalition will be a little bit messier? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=209.3s)]
*  Or maybe there's some way in which this new coalition can actually address those issues. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=214.84s)]
*  I think we're looking right at the moment with a bit of a deadlock, a hung parliament. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=220.1s)]
*  What that means right now is ultimately status quo for the moment. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=226.26000000000002s)]
*  But going forward, there's not much that Macron or France really can do. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=230.5s)]
*  So you've got these parties with very different views, notably on questions of taxes or the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=234.82000000000002s)]
*  minimum wage, which the left-wing coalition wants to raise. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=241.18s)]
*  Also on Ukraine, that had been more of a concern with the far right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=246.08s)]
*  But it just means that Macron really can't go forward with a lot of things for now. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=250.68s)]
*  As Prime Minister tried to resign, Macron said no, stick around for a little while, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=255.98000000000002s)]
*  notably because France is about to host the Olympics. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=260.22s)]
*  So I think we're probably going to have just a caretaker government for the coming weeks [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  until they can try to build some kind of new alliance. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=267.14s)]
*  And then we'll see if they can move forward really with any policies that have any real [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=270.5s)]
*  impact on France or internationally. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=275.38s)]
*  Angela Charlton with the Associated Press, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgvQ2s_auM&t=277.94s)]
