# Conditions in Sudan are "just chaotic" as U.S. evacuates personnel
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog)
*  Good morning and welcome to Face the Nation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=0.0s)]
*  We begin with a daring special forces rescue operation to get American diplomats out of [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=3.12s)]
*  Sudan where fighting continues as two top generals there jockey for power. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=8.32s)]
*  The State Department says security conditions aren't expected to improve anytime soon and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=14.08s)]
*  has temporarily suspended operations at the U.S. Embassy in Sudan's capital Khartoum. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile there are still hundreds of American citizens stranded in Sudan where the airports [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=25.92s)]
*  have been closed for days. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  For more now we turn to national security correspondent David Martin. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=33.32s)]
*  David good morning. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=37.52s)]
*  So this operation was high risk. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=39.72s)]
*  You had U.S. forces flying 800 miles from Djibouti to Ethiopia then launching from Ethiopia [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  to Sudan and had to go all the way back to Djibouti at the end. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=48.36s)]
*  Air lifted up about 100 people out of the U.S. Embassy. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=52.52s)]
*  How did all this come together? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  Well distance was the primary challenge here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  800 miles, helicopters just can't go that far so you had to set up this forward staging [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  base in Ethiopia where they could top off before the aircraft went into the embassy [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=68.72s)]
*  in Khartoum. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=76.08s)]
*  The other thing was the uncertainty of whether or not they were going to be shot at. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=78.28s)]
*  Both generals of these two warring sides had been warned in no uncertain terms do not interfere [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=83.36s)]
*  but you couldn't count at that because we've seen all these cease fires break down. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=91.32s)]
*  So the aircraft went in at night low level and they had 100 special operations commandos [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=96.72s)]
*  on board. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=104.36s)]
*  Both commandos set up a perimeter around this landing zone that was just outside the embassy [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  and guarded that perimeter while the diplomats boarded the helicopters. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=112.8s)]
*  Overhead there were two C-130 aircraft, one of which was for communications, the other [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  was a gunship ready to take anybody who tried to approach the embassy under fire. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  They were on the ground for a little more than half an hour, no shots for fire and then [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=131.12s)]
*  they were back on their way. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=140.04s)]
*  Somebody called it a pretty easy in and out but it was a long and grueling night. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=142.88s)]
*  I mean from start to finish it was 17 hours. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=149.88s)]
*  And it was so high risk. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=153.52s)]
*  This went, sounds like as best as could possibly be expected but there are still hundreds of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=155.12s)]
*  American citizens who were on the ground. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=160.38s)]
*  There was no plan to evacuate them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=162.34s)]
*  These were just government personnel pulled out. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=164.38s)]
*  The State Department and the Pentagon say they'll do what they can to help Americans [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=167.66s)]
*  get out. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=171.5s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=172.5s)]
*  Well it certainly doesn't mean going in and seizing the airport and doing the normal kind [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=173.5s)]
*  of evacuation aboard airliners out of there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=178.42s)]
*  What it means is conducting reconnaissance along this land route that goes from Khartoum [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=181.3s)]
*  all the way over to Port Sudan on the Red Sea which is a 12 hour drive under the best [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  conditions so they can conduct reconnaissance over that and then they can have U.S. Navy [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=194.89999999999998s)]
*  ships waiting to take in any Americans who make that drive. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  But that again will be at a minimum a long and grueling drive and the conditions are [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  just chaotic. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=213.94s)]
*  It is such a high risk environment. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=216.38s)]
*  David, thank you very much for all of your reporting. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swk0xytGXog&t=219.02s)]
