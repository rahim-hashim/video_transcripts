# Biden blocks Japanese rival Nippon Steelâ€™s takeover of U.S. Steel
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA)
*  Turning to the White House now, President Biden has blocked the proposed $14.9 billion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=0.0s)]
*  takeover of U.S. steel by Japanese rival Nippon Steel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=6.4s)]
*  In a statement released this morning, the president said he was blocking the deal to, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=9.92s)]
*  quote, ensure that now and long into the future, America has a strong domestically owned and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=13.84s)]
*  operated steel industry. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=19.56s)]
*  Joining us now for more on this is CBS News' Homeland Security and Justice reporter Nicole [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=21.76s)]
*  Skanga. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=25.52s)]
*  One more, can you tell us about why the president blocked this deal? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=27.0s)]
*  Yeah, Michael, good to be with you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=30.24s)]
*  A $14.9 billion with a B dollar takeover of U.S. steel by Nippon Steel, a decision that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=32.56s)]
*  comes after weeks and months of speculation here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=41.32s)]
*  This is an iconic American company whose sale to a foreign buyer, the president has at least [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=44.64s)]
*  subtly signaled that he is opposed to now for weeks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=50.4s)]
*  With the decision coming today, I want to read to you part of that statement that we [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=53.88s)]
*  just showed to viewers. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=57.38s)]
*  The president saying, a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=58.580000000000005s)]
*  an essential national security priority and it's critical for resilient supply chains. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=63.64s)]
*  He goes on to say that he's taking action to block the deal because, of course, his [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=69.28s)]
*  solemn responsibility as president is to ensure that now and long into the future, America [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=73.64s)]
*  has a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry, but just exercising an enormous [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=78.6s)]
*  amount of executive power here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=84.52s)]
*  The timing is also noticeable, as of course, the president will depart the White House [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=86.52s)]
*  in just a few weeks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  You know, a federal committee had reviewed this transaction. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=93.92s)]
*  It's called CFIUS. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  It stands for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=98.6s)]
*  And they had issued a report just prior to Christmas, but ultimately determined that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=101.8s)]
*  they were not going to recommend that the president block the deal or greenlight the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=107.44s)]
*  deal. And that left the final decision, you know, with Biden. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=111.64s)]
*  And then, of course, all of this not happening in a vacuum. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=115.0s)]
*  Still a concern about jobs. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=117.92s)]
*  Nippon Steel had promised no layoffs or plant closures during the term of the current [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=119.72s)]
*  union contract, which does expire in September of twenty twenty six. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=125.44s)]
*  Still, you know, there were concerns about the company shifting jobs from the United [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=130.32s)]
*  States, shifting them from union facilities to non-union facilities. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=134.56s)]
*  And USW, the Steelworkers Union, had ultimately come out against the deal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  There were other unions that were in support of it, but most notably that union, which [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  claims over a million members, supported President Biden during the twenty twenty [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=149.36s)]
*  election. So that's notable here as well, Michael. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  Nicole, let's talk big picture. What repercussions could this decision have between Japan [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=158.52s)]
*  and the U.S.? Yeah, well, this is a decision with wide ranging implications for the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=163.52s)]
*  U.S. economy. It could also send a signal to other potential foreign investors who are [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=168.52s)]
*  looking to acquire American companies. Hey, you know, not so fast. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=173.72s)]
*  Certainly it could shake our relationship with Japan, a close ally of the United States. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  Certainly some of the president's advisors in the days leading up to this decision warning [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  that rejecting such a sizable acquisition by a Japanese company could in fact harm the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=188.72s)]
*  relationship between Japan and the United States. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=195.44s)]
*  And even as the administration had cited potential national security concerns regarding this [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=198.76s)]
*  deal, there were certainly other outside independent analysts who were skeptical of that sort [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=204.56s)]
*  of rationale, citing politics instead. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=209.66s)]
*  Even back in April of this year, the Japanese prime minister came out in support of this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=212.72s)]
*  deal, arguing that it would only increase steel production capacity and increase jobs [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=217.4s)]
*  here in the United States, growing more jobs. We could see in the coming weeks, Michael, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  litigation by both U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  But it's back to the drawing board for U.S. Steel in terms of if it wants to continue shopping [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=232.8s)]
*  for buyers here or act as a standalone company. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=237.44s)]
*  But this is a company that has not too many financial resources in terms of, you know, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=240.72s)]
*  putting those back into its steelmaking furnaces in Pennsylvania and in Gary, Indiana. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=246.16s)]
*  And they've made that clear. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=251.84s)]
*  All right, Nicole Skanga, thanks for breaking that down for us. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOg6zVMXCsA&t=253.35999999999999s)]
