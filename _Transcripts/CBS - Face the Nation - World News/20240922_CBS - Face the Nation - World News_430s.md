# Israeli President Isaac Herzog says "the world has to be with us" in Middle East fight
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY)
*  We turn now to the president of Israel, Isaac Hirsog. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=3.9s)]
*  Thank you, Margaret. Good morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=5.8s)]
*  Mr. President, in the past few days, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=7.74s)]
*  Israel carried out a groundbreaking operation [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=9.78s)]
*  against thousands of Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=13.48s)]
*  The U.S. was only given 20 minutes' notice ahead of time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=17.18s)]
*  Since then, Israel also carried out a strike in Beirut [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=20.56s)]
*  that killed senior commanders of Hezbollah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=24.36s)]
*  What is the strategy here, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=28.06s)]
*  and is Israel trying to escalate [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=30.1s)]
*  into a full-blown war with Hezbollah? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=33.3s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=35.7s)]
*  We did not want this war. We're not seeking war. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=37.66s)]
*  This war was waged upon us [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=41.16s)]
*  by the proxies of the Empire of Evil of Iran. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=43.14s)]
*  On October 7th, by Hamas, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=47.04s)]
*  and on October 8th, by Hezbollah, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=49.84s)]
*  and ever since, from Lebanon in the north, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=52.34s)]
*  and, of course, from Hamas in the south, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=55.18s)]
*  and all over the Middle East, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=57.2s)]
*  the proxies of Iran are attacking and attacking. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=59.84s)]
*  Now, Hezbollah's been attacking us on a daily basis, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=62.48s)]
*  demolishing Israeli villages and towns, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=66.08s)]
*  basically leading to the eviction [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=69.28s)]
*  of 100,000 Israelis from their homes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=72.06s)]
*  Life has been shattered in our northern border. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=75.92s)]
*  I don't think any American would have accepted it [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=78.72s)]
*  as a kind of a status quo situation in the United States. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=81.9s)]
*  And at the end, there are things that must be done. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=87.02s)]
*  The duty of a government or a nation [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=90.41999999999999s)]
*  is to take care of its citizens and bring them back home. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  But on the issue of what's happening [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=95.66s)]
*  in the north of Israel right now, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=98.72s)]
*  the White House argues that a war in Lebanon [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=100.55999999999999s)]
*  is not the way to bring those 100,000 Israelis [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  back into their homes. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=107.3s)]
*  They want a diplomatic agreement about that blue line. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=109.6s)]
*  Do you think that the current government of Israel [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=113.63999999999999s)]
*  wants a diplomatic agreement? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=116.66s)]
*  We never said that we don't want a diplomatic agreement. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=120.1s)]
*  On the contrary, there is a very able American envoy, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=124.1s)]
*  Amos Hoechstein, the president's advisor, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=128.54s)]
*  who's trying to go back and forth [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=131.28s)]
*  between us and the Lebanese. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=133.48s)]
*  But truly, let's understand the situation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=135.74s)]
*  When you're dealing with terror organizations, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=138.28s)]
*  they don't really give a damn about international affairs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=140.58s)]
*  They take hostages or they fire as much as they want. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=144.34s)]
*  They get instructions from Tehran. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=147.94s)]
*  They send Houthi terrorists to block the high seas [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=150.14s)]
*  and the cost of living in the world goes up. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=154.38s)]
*  This is the culture of terror. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=156.48s)]
*  And it's a terror of jihadists, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=158.22s)]
*  meaning they don't give a damn about anything. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=160.32s)]
*  Now, we agree time and again to go into rounds of talks. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=162.45999999999998s)]
*  We support and welcome the efforts [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=167.06s)]
*  by the United States of America and the administration. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=170.1s)]
*  Truly, we respect it tremendously. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=173.46s)]
*  But at the end of it, okay, Mr. Hoechstein leaves Israel [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  and they keep on firing and firing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=179.56s)]
*  And that cannot go on forever [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=181.5s)]
*  because our citizens must go back home. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=183.84s)]
*  Because the guy in Lebanon, Mr. Nasrallah, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=186.64s)]
*  thinks that he wants to link it to Gaza. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=190.44s)]
*  And in Gaza, there's another arch terrorist, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=193.54s)]
*  Mr. Sinwar in the dungeons, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=196.42s)]
*  who doesn't want to get to a deal, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=198.28s)]
*  refuses to get to a deal. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=200.66s)]
*  This is jihadism at its best. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  And that's what we are fighting. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  And I wish, truly, and I say it [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=206.34s)]
*  as the president of Israel officially, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  and I say it outright because I know we don't want war, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=210.54000000000002s)]
*  but if it's waged against us, we go all the way. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=214.38000000000002s)]
*  Well, you say you don't want war, Mr. President. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  Israel moved its 98th division [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=221.02s)]
*  to the north of Israel this week. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=223.28s)]
*  Your defense minister says the center of gravity [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=225.26000000000002s)]
*  is moving towards Lebanon. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=227.56s)]
*  What is the intention of those military moves, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=229.84s)]
*  if not to prepare for war? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  Because these guys who we eradicated on Friday [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=236.48s)]
*  were gathering together in their apartment in Beirut [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=241.56s)]
*  in order to plan another October 7th. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=246.42s)]
*  They developed this school of thought [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=250.45999999999998s)]
*  of swarming into Israel, of trying to take hostage, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=252.89999999999998s)]
*  of butchering, raping, burning, abducting. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=256.82s)]
*  At the end, we have enough risks here to take care of. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=260.12s)]
*  Pardon? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=264.62s)]
*  Do you have evidence that there was an imminent attack? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=265.46000000000004s)]
*  So I can't go into all the information itself, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=269.02s)]
*  but it is assumed that they were planning an attack. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  You see today, this morning, they took out a barrage [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=275.86s)]
*  of attacks on Israeli cities, towns, and villages, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=281.1s)]
*  all over the northern part of Israel, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=285.04s)]
*  pounding with huge bombs and missiles [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=287.36s)]
*  on the northern part of Israel. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=290.88s)]
*  Why would any nation accept it? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=292.88s)]
*  Why would any decent nation accept it? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=294.72s)]
*  We're almost a year in such a situation [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=297.56s)]
*  of a kind of a vicious cycle. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=300.76s)]
*  We want to get out of this vicious cycle. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=303.02s)]
*  This past week, the AP put out graphic footage [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=306.14s)]
*  shot in the West Bank, where Israeli soldiers [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=309.16s)]
*  pushed the bodies of Palestinians off the roof [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=311.52s)]
*  of buildings there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=314.48s)]
*  The White House says they want an investigation, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=315.48s)]
*  that this is abhorrent and egregious behavior. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  How do you respond to these concerns [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=320.6s)]
*  from one of your closest allies [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=323.16s)]
*  that Israel may be adding to escalation risk? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=325.56s)]
*  So we, of course, listen to our closest ally openly [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=330.20000000000005s)]
*  and frankly, if it occurred as reported, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=334.72s)]
*  and it is under investigation, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  because we are a nation of the rule of law, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=341.0s)]
*  we will, of course, take all necessary action. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=343.72s)]
*  We will condemn it and use all the legal steps [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=346.8s)]
*  that need to be taken against it, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=351.12s)]
*  but we are studying it, because we're a serious army [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  and a serious people, and we study and investigate ourselves [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  as much as we can. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  Before I let you go, do you think [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=361.32000000000005s)]
*  that President Biden's efforts to negotiate [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=363.22s)]
*  that hostage deal is just wishful thinking at this point? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=365.58000000000004s)]
*  Will this be a problem for the next American president? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=369.64000000000004s)]
*  So actually, I would say that I have huge respect [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=373.76000000000005s)]
*  for President Biden's effort, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=377.56s)]
*  and we supported wholeheartedly, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=379.64000000000004s)]
*  but as the spokesperson of the National Security Council, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  General Kirby, just said the other day, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  we are not getting any positive signs from Hamas at all, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  from Sinwar. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=393.56s)]
*  He's out there in the dungeons taking, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=394.6s)]
*  I mean, whatever we think in our line of thinking [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM0Uat6odbY&t=398.04s)]
