# What is the impact of Trump and Zelenskyy's hostility?
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk)
*  Hi, and thank you for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=0.0s)]
*  The relationship between US President Donald Trump [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=1.34s)]
*  and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=3.68s)]
*  appears to be dissolving as the two leaders [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=6.0s)]
*  exchange harsh criticisms of the other. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=8.44s)]
*  It started with President Trump appearing to accuse Ukraine [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=11.36s)]
*  Tuesday of starting the war with Russia. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=14.6s)]
*  But today I heard, oh, well, we weren't invited. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=17.92s)]
*  Well, you've been there for three years. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=19.76s)]
*  You should have ended it three years. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=21.12s)]
*  You should have never started it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=22.88s)]
*  You could have made a deal. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Zelensky responded to that comment, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=26.28s)]
*  accusing President Trump of quote, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=28.08s)]
*  living in a disinformation space. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=29.52s)]
*  Then on Wednesday, President Trump [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=32.08s)]
*  posted on True Social calling Zelensky a dictator. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=33.6s)]
*  The comment was met with mixed reactions [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  from Republican lawmakers. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=39.12s)]
*  President Trump just called Zelensky a dictator. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=41.56s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=43.839999999999996s)]
*  I definitely agree. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=44.8s)]
*  Is it wise to criticize Zelensky? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=46.28s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the tactics. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=48.44s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the tactics. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  President Trump's going to be able to deliver it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=51.28s)]
*  He understands what the stakes are. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=54.28s)]
*  I would like to see that in context, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=56.4s)]
*  because I would certainly never refer to President Zelensky [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=58.72s)]
*  as a dictator. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=65.72s)]
*  President Trump on Wednesday is speaking [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  at an investment conference sponsored [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=69.84s)]
*  by the Saudi government. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=71.52s)]
*  And it comes a day after the US and Russia held [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=72.64s)]
*  talks in Saudi Arabia about a plan forward [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=77.52s)]
*  CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=79.0s)]
*  joins me now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=81.28s)]
*  Major, are you surprised by how quickly [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=81.88s)]
*  the attacks against President Zelensky [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  from members of the Trump administration, Mike [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=87.0s)]
*  Walz, JD Vance, the president himself, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=89.28s)]
*  have really ramped up? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=91.36000000000001s)]
*  And what does it mean for a potential resolution? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  We don't know at all what it might mean [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=94.28s)]
*  for an outline of a resolution. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  That's a long way away. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=98.12s)]
*  And when that resolution, if it ever comes, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=100.28s)]
*  it may be months from now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  And this may be an afterthought. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  But in the moment, it justifiably rattles Ukrainians. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=106.4s)]
*  They did not start the war. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  They have suffered grievously from it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=111.36s)]
*  They're not the provocateur here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=114.2s)]
*  They didn't provoke Russia to attack. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=115.64s)]
*  Russia decided to attack a sovereign country militarily, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=117.28s)]
*  thought it would win the war within a matter of weeks. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=120.96s)]
*  It's now ground on for three years. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=123.12s)]
*  That's testament to the courage of the Ukrainians [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=125.76s)]
*  and the mismanagement of the Russian military. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=128.4s)]
*  All that being said, this hostility [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=133.16s)]
*  strikes Russians as siding with them, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=136.52s)]
*  at least at the beginning of these negotiations, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=139.28s)]
*  and sidelining the Ukrainians. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=141.52s)]
*  That may not be how it ultimately turns out, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=143.28s)]
*  but that's how it looks. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=146.88s)]
*  And the Russians have a very long history [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=148.52s)]
*  of diplomatic dealings with the United States, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=150.76s)]
*  taking every advantage up front [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=152.56s)]
*  and never giving any inch of that advantage back. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=154.32s)]
*  That's one thing that the president [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=157.72s)]
*  is going to have to reconcile himself to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=158.84s)]
*  as these negotiations continue. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=160.44s)]
*  What is the significance of the president's appearance [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=162.2s)]
*  at this Saudi-backed event? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=165.16s)]
*  So President Trump believes that the Saudis [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=166.28s)]
*  are the key force diplomatically [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=169.12s)]
*  and economically in the Middle East. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=172.08s)]
*  They want to normalize relations with Israel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=174.24s)]
*  They want to be the counterweight against Iran. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=176.16s)]
*  They are one of the nations in that region [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  that could finance or collectively organize financing [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=183.08s)]
*  to do something about Gaza that would be an alternative [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=186.44s)]
*  to President Trump's declaration [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=189.44s)]
*  the United States will take over Gaza [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=191.44s)]
*  and turn it into a Riviera. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=193.12s)]
*  That's never going to happen, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=194.84s)]
*  but it's a way of signaling to the Saudis, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=195.88s)]
*  hey, you better get involved. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=198.4s)]
*  You better pony up some dollars [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=199.64s)]
*  and get other aligned nations to do so as well. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=201.28s)]
*  President Trump believes almost all of those things [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=204.32s)]
*  that he cares about in the region flow through Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=206.4s)]
*  It's worth pointing out that Saudi Arabia [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=210.4s)]
*  has to put it charitably a mixed record on human rights [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=211.88s)]
*  as does Russia. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=216.0s)]
*  And right now, the alignment of this administration [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=217.44s)]
*  soft pedals human rights violations, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=220.84s)]
*  dictatorial conduct in Saudi Arabia and in Russia [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=224.16s)]
*  because the larger aims for President Trump [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  don't really weigh that as heavily [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  as the Biden administration did. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=232.56s)]
*  We're going to keep ping ponging topics as we do every day [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=235.4s)]
*  because there is news coming at us full speed. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=237.6s)]
*  We know the Department of Transportation Tuesday [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  is calling for the cancellation [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=243.52s)]
*  of New York City's congestion pricing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=245.84s)]
*  And you mentioned this at the beginning of America Decides. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  This is not just a New York City thing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=249.56s)]
*  This is a national thing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=251.52s)]
*  Many cities have been watching what New York City does [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=252.48s)]
*  with this congestion pricing, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=254.44s)]
*  charging people more for going into a certain area [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=255.6s)]
*  in the heart of the city. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=257.84s)]
*  The president in response, he posted, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=259.28s)]
*  "'Congestion pricing is dead. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=261.84s)]
*  "'And Manhattan and all of New York is saved. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=263.2s)]
*  "'Long live the King.' [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=264.76s)]
*  And the White House reposted it with this image. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=265.76s)]
*  Shocking certainly. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=269.04s)]
*  What is your reaction? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=270.56s)]
*  The image speaks for itself. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=272.12s)]
*  And is that trolling? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=274.0s)]
*  Is that just to make people who don't like the idea [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=275.84s)]
*  of a king in America freak out and get overreacting, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=279.48s)]
*  which is a typical Trumpian troll? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=282.88s)]
*  I'll let everyone else figure out what that means. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=286.12s)]
*  And whether or not the history of this country [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=289.08s)]
*  is comfortable with a king. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=291.48s)]
*  Short answer, no, it's not. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=294.64s)]
*  This issue though is of significance [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=297.64s)]
*  because lots of cities have tried to figure out [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=300.28s)]
*  what is the best mechanism to reduce traffic [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=302.8s)]
*  to increase safety both for vehicles and pedestrians [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=306.04s)]
*  and do you have to charge people more [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=309.96s)]
*  to change their commuting habits? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=311.28s)]
*  This was an outgrowth of five years of study [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  and lots of regulatory back and forth. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=316.36s)]
*  It was finally approved and with one fell swoop, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ry02wbj7mk&t=318.24s)]
