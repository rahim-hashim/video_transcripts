# Assad regime's fall opens up parts of Syria once closed to Western journalists
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw)
*  And meanwhile in Syria celebrations continue as questions swirl about what the post-Assad [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=0.0s)]
*  era will look like. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=6.48s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent MTS Tayyab is in Syria for us tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=7.84s)]
*  MTS? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=12.56s)]
*  Well, it's been extraordinary to be here in Syria after so many years in which Western [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=13.56s)]
*  journalists simply could not enter, could not see the places that we've seen really [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=18.56s)]
*  in the last 24 hours or so. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=23.8s)]
*  We were in Aleppo this morning, which up until two weeks ago was regime held, which meant [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=26.2s)]
*  Basar al-Assad and his forces were in control. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  That of course fell to rebel groups, the rebel group known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=37.8s)]
*  And we're now here in Idlib, where Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has been in control for a number of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=42.76s)]
*  years. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=49.68s)]
*  HTS is considered a terrorist organization by the United Nations, by the U.S. and other [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=50.839999999999996s)]
*  Western powers. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=57.76s)]
*  But they've now ousted Basar al-Assad, they're now in control of Damascus, and global powers [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=58.76s)]
*  are really trying to figure out how they work with HTS. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=65.2s)]
*  Do they change this designation? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=70.16s)]
*  Do they formally recognize that? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=72.4s)]
*  All of this will become clear in the days, weeks and even months ahead. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=74.56s)]
*  But the reason we're here in Idlib is we wanted to understand what life was like under HTS. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=78.72s)]
*  And the people who we spoke to in this admittedly conservative part of Syria had one clear message [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  to all of this, to all of us rather, which was this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=93.0s)]
*  HTS will protect the rights of minorities in a country that was so riven by divisions, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=97.88s)]
*  particularly when it came to the issue of minorities. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=105.64s)]
*  That is certainly something many Syrians, including the many millions of Syrians living [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=109.55999999999999s)]
*  as refugees abroad, want to hear. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=114.08s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moLVLJGozw&t=117.36s)]
