# Britain mourns Queen Elizabeth II as Charles III begins reign
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E)
*  Today, the United Kingdom is in mourning for Queen Elizabeth, its longest-serving monarch, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=0.0s)]
*  who will be laid to rest next Monday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=5.44s)]
*  World leaders are preparing to travel there in the coming days to pay their respects to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=7.92s)]
*  her memory and to her son, King Charles III. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=12.16s)]
*  Today, he will be formerly proclaimed King of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=15.92s)]
*  CBS Evening News anchor Nora O'Donnell is there in London. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=21.04s)]
*  Nora? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=25.52s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=26.52s)]
*  It has been an incredibly moving morning here for many in England as Queen Elizabeth II [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=27.68s)]
*  begins her long journey home. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=32.24s)]
*  This morning, we saw her oak coffin covered with the Royal Standard of Scotland beginning [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=34.44s)]
*  its slow six-hour journey from Balmoral Castle to the country's capital of Edinburgh. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=39.16s)]
*  There were tens of thousands of people lining the roads in tribute to the Queen. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=44.2s)]
*  The coffin will then rest in the throne room of the Palace of Holyrood, that is Holyrood [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=49.0s)]
*  House. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=53.56s)]
*  The Queen will then be the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland until Monday afternoon. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  Then King Charles III and the Queen consort will arrive Monday as the coffin moves to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=58.0s)]
*  St Giles Cathedral, where she will lie in state. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=62.52s)]
*  And then the new sovereign will then make a tour of the countries that make up the United [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=65.48s)]
*  Kingdom, including Ireland, before the funeral next Monday on September 19th. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=69.56s)]
*  And you know, Margaret, there has been much said about the people's sentimental attachment [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=75.0s)]
*  to the monarch, the Commonwealth's matriarch, but her reign marked not just for its constancy, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=80.0s)]
*  but its length of 70 years and some said, of course, like a living link to World War [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=84.88s)]
*  II. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=88.64s)]
*  So it's perhaps fitting that the Queen's state funeral will be the first in Britain since [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=89.64s)]
*  Winston Churchill in 1965. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=93.92s)]
*  And Nora, I can see behind you there at Buckingham Palace, the memorials and the outpouring of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=97.2s)]
*  sympathy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=103.4s)]
*  I wonder what it's like for you being on the ground in what is truly a historic moment. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=104.4s)]
*  It is. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  So many people here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  Actually, the King is holding meetings here today. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  And also people were touched to see the now Prince and Princess of Wales spend nearly [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=115.48s)]
*  an hour meeting with people outside Windsor Castle. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  A royal source says that Prince William invited his brother, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=121.84s)]
*  Harry and Meghan to join them. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=127.04s)]
*  And it is the first time we've seen the four together in two years. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  And the academics here in the papers this morning are saying this is a moment that in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=133.32s)]
*  some ways will never be replicated. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  A woman whose reign was historic in length revered for her grace and strength was also [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=138.0s)]
*  known for her soft power, meeting 13 U.S. presidents, countless world leaders, giving [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=143.57999999999998s)]
*  advice and guidance to 15 prime ministers here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=150.44s)]
*  And as you know quite well, Margaret, being the first British sovereign to visit Ireland [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  in a century and helping calm tensions there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=157.84s)]
*  So many people noting this passing of an era and of course the world leaders expected to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=160.72s)]
*  be here next week, the following week, to mourn her at Westminster Abbey. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=166.84s)]
*  Margaret. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=172.68s)]
*  Nora, thank you for your reporting there and we'll continue to cover that throughout [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=173.68s)]
*  CBS News programs. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAPXJp1Ut1E&t=178.06s)]
