# What to know about Trump's tariffs on China, Canada after Mexico reaches agreement for 1-month pause
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M)
*  President Trump backing off his threats to impose tariffs on at least one of America's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=0.0s)]
*  three largest trading partners today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=6.04s)]
*  The president confirmed an agreement with Mexico's president to delay those tariffs by one month. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=8.48s)]
*  Trump also spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with another conversation scheduled [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  to happen in just a few hours. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=18.76s)]
*  A reminder for our viewers here, tariffs against Canada and China are still scheduled to take [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=21.2s)]
*  effect tomorrow. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=26.84s)]
*  Now those moves from the White House look to be having an effect on the market. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=28.32s)]
*  You can see that there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=32.4s)]
*  This is a live look at the Dow Jones Industrial. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=33.4s)]
*  At one point, the Dow fell more than 550 points. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=36.0s)]
*  CBS News Senior White House correspondent Weisha Zhang joins us now for more. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  And Mexico says the conversation with Trump was a productive one. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=44.4s)]
*  How did the two come to this agreement in the first place? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=48.72s)]
*  Well, we always knew that this was likely coming, this conversation, because it started [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=52.84s)]
*  as soon as President Trump took office and he made the threats of these tariffs against [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=58.68000000000001s)]
*  Mexico and Canada. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=63.88s)]
*  And so we do know that President Trump spoke with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  on the phone and it ended with a pause in the tariffs. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=71.04s)]
*  And those stock numbers that you pointed to, no doubt a factor in this because you can [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=75.72s)]
*  really see in real time how it could potentially not only affect the U.S. economy, but the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=80.0s)]
*  global one as well. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=84.76s)]
*  And so Mexico has agreed to do more at the border, to send in more of its guards at the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=86.4s)]
*  southern border to ensure that there is a decrease of migration. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=92.76s)]
*  Of course, all of this is a political tool that the president has used many times to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=97.44s)]
*  try to get other countries to align with his goals. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=102.64s)]
*  And of course, the border is among his top priorities here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=107.08s)]
*  And so we'll see if the tariffs actually go into effect in one month, but for now they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=111.72s)]
*  are paused to see what kind of progress can be made to stop the flow of migrants. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=116.48s)]
*  Okay, Luisa, I want to talk about the Secretary of State Marco Rubio. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=122.68s)]
*  He's on the move today making his first international trip since being confirmed to the role. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=126.8s)]
*  And just moments ago, he touched down in El Salvador. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=131.56s)]
*  What are we expecting to see from that visit? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=134.48s)]
*  Well, we know that the secretary made some news. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  He confirmed the reporting of our colleague, Jennifer Jacobs, who had just reported minutes [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  before that he would become the acting administrator of USAID. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=147.64s)]
*  Of course, that is an aid organization here based in Washington that helps millions and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=151.2s)]
*  millions of people across the world. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=158.12s)]
*  And so Rubio talked about that, about how he would be spearheading the effort to sort [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=160.4s)]
*  of reorganize that organization and said there would likely be a reduction in workforce and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=173.4s)]
*  a different amount of aid, but that it would not be shut down altogether. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=181.44s)]
*  So we spoke about that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=184.84s)]
*  We also know that he is going to be talking to the president of El Salvador, which is [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=185.92s)]
*  a critical country for this administration in order to carry out its goals on immigration. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=189.92s)]
*  Because when you're talking about mass deportations at the scale that the president wants, you [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=196.48s)]
*  have to think about where are the migrants going to go. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=201.27999999999997s)]
*  And so he will be trying to convince the president there to accept migrants that are not Salvadorian, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=204.16s)]
*  nationals, but to accept people there as a safe haven for them instead of waiting out [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=211.44s)]
*  their cases here in the U.S. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=219.16s)]
*  So that is a big topic of conversation today. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=221.0s)]
*  Let's talk about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=224.96s)]
*  We know he's visiting the southern border for his first trip since being confirmed. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=227.24s)]
*  What do we know about his goal there? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=232.54s)]
*  Well, we know that he made this announcement himself on X. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  And he said that I'll be visiting our troops at the southern border. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=239.36s)]
*  He said POTUS wants 100 percent operational control of the border and we will deliver. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=242.84s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth went on to say border security is national security in all caps. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=248.96s)]
*  So essentially this is an information gathering trip, I imagine, because he wants to see what [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=253.12s)]
*  these servicemen and women are doing. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=261.0s)]
*  He wants to report back to President Trump about the resources there and what more the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=263.64s)]
*  military can do. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=268.88s)]
*  And he has already said many times that the military would assist in this endeavor in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=269.88s)]
*  any way possible. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=275.96s)]
*  What we don't know is exactly how many troops could be heading to the southern border and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=276.96s)]
*  exactly what additional troops will be there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=282.56s)]
*  We know that on day one the president signed an executive order sending about 1,500 troops [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=285.14s)]
*  there and part of what they are doing is continuing construction of the border wall [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=289.96s)]
*  and offering any assistance to enforcement that is required. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  Okay, Weijia Zhang, thank you so much for your time today. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USdEq_24_M&t=298.56s)]
