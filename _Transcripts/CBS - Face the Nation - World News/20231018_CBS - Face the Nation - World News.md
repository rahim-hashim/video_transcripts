# President Biden tells Israelis "you are not alone" during speech in Tel Aviv | full video
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo)
*  As we wait President Biden in Israel, since we last spoke on the show this morning, East Coast time, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=0.0s)]
*  there's a little bit more of a development around what intel the president was basing his [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=7.76s)]
*  the other team comment regarding this explosion at the hospital. What can you tell us? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=12.64s)]
*  Right, well the president had initially said it appears the other team did this. He wasn't [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=16.8s)]
*  any more specific than that, what he meant by which team. But what we now know is that the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  president when pressed on this said he had viewed intelligence provided to him by the U.S. Pentagon, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=28.08s)]
*  by the Department of Defense. So that implies this is not solely based on those Israeli intercepts [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=33.92s)]
*  that were made public by the IDF, phone calls from militants from a group called Islamic Jihad, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=40.48s)]
*  which is a militant group that fights alongside Hamas, but it's not technically part of it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  We haven't seen that declassified intelligence. If they are working to declassify it, but you [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=52.08s)]
*  can imagine that the president will have to explain more of why he is landing in Israel amid [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=56.8s)]
*  this outcry that we are seeing in the surrounding. And there's a question of whether any kind of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  intelligence will change the narrative as it already exists, right? We're agonizing over the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  details. What can we know? And yet even if the intelligence says one thing, will the wider world [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=70.16s)]
*  believe it? That's an open question. Right. Talk about the fallout, if you will, already about [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=76.96s)]
*  following this explosion at the hospital and the hundreds dead. Right, and it's not just the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=81.44s)]
*  explosion as horrific as it is to see a hospital targeted in a civilian area. We talked about the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=86.0s)]
*  death toll from that disgusting attack by Hamas in Israel, but according to the Gazan authorities, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=92.72s)]
*  there are 3000 Palestinian dead in the Gaza Strip. They claim 12,000 people have been injured in the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=100.08s)]
*  past 11 days. So those numbers, well, we can't verify them any more than we can go and verify [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=106.4s)]
*  any battlefield or bombing deaths independently. That is what the Arab world is seeing, that there [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=112.16s)]
*  appears to be a different response to loss on life and a criticism that this is not proportionate for. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=120.24s)]
*  So there's a pressure on the president from King Abdullah, from other Arab leaders, to stand up [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=126.72s)]
*  there and say, let's have a ceasefire. Let's have a cessation of violence. He has not said that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=131.12s)]
*  Yeah, Margaret, we're glad you joined us here at the desk. We'll check back in with you in a second. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  Senior Foreign Correspondent Holly Williams is in Tel Aviv right now. Holly, good morning. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=140.4s)]
*  Good morning, Nate. This trip is essentially a massive show of support for Israel by President [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=147.44000000000003s)]
*  Biden. He's met today not just with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  emergency war cabinet, but also with Israeli first responders and even with a survivor of the massacre. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=157.44s)]
*  Earlier today, President Biden said to Netanyahu, quote, I want you to know you're not alone, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  we will continue to have Israel's back as you work to defend your people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=170.48s)]
*  Are we now hearing from President Biden? I think we might be, Holly. Control, is this a live picture [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=177.04s)]
*  we have now? No, no, we are not. We are not, Holly. Forgive us. It's not. OK. It's earlier. Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=183.76s)]
*  I'm sorry about that. I could hear President Biden in my voice. Yeah. So look, what we've been hearing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=189.36s)]
*  from some Israelis over the last few days is that President Biden is showing the kind of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=194.24s)]
*  leadership that they would like to see from Prime Minister Netanyahu. And they point to President [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=199.44s)]
*  Biden's speech last week when he called the attack by Hamas, quote, pure unadulterated evil. Now, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=204.24s)]
*  the U.S. is already surging munitions to its ally. And with a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  expected in the days ahead, Israel has requested another $10 billion in emergency military aid [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  from the U.S. Many people here blame their own government for the apparent security failures [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=222.56s)]
*  that allowed Hamas militants to go on that bloody rampage. All right, Holly Williams, of course, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=228.88s)]
*  we'll get back to you in just a second. Thank you so much, Margaret. You know, we keep talking [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=235.52s)]
*  about the blame game on either sides for the attack of the hospital. But what does either [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=239.52s)]
*  side have to gain by bombing a hospital full of civilians? That's why this makes no sense. And [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=243.68s)]
*  certainly, why would Israel or anyone, Israel in particular, bomb a hospital when you know the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=248.8s)]
*  United States president is coming there to an active war zone? Right. Why would that be a [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  strategic choice? Exactly. That doesn't seem to be a rational choice, right? So that is on their [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=259.44s)]
*  side. Or the militant group side. Right. Certainly not. On Hamas' side, there was this intercept that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  the IDF, the Israeli military released saying that they had evidence of communications between [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=271.44s)]
*  some of the fighters, realizing they had made a mistake and that it wasn't an intentional bombing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=278.16s)]
*  That's a hell of a mistake, don't you think? Oh, absolutely. I would think that everybody would [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=283.6s)]
*  verify that. Everybody would dot all their I's and cross all their T's, especially during this time. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=287.6s)]
*  These rockets routinely fall short. It's a common occurrence in the conditions that they're fighting. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=292.32000000000005s)]
*  These are militants. These are terrorists. This is not the Israeli military, which has precision [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=296.16s)]
*  bombs and one of the most sophisticated and well-financed and well-supported militaries [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=300.8s)]
*  in the world. We see the president approaching the microphone. We'll go straight to him now. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=304.56s)]
*  I come to Israel with a single message. You're not alone. You are not alone. As long as the United [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=308.48s)]
*  States stands and we will stand forever, we will not let you ever be alone. Most importantly, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=316.08s)]
*  I know the recent terrorist assault on the people of this nation has left a deep, deep wound. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=324.96s)]
*  More than 1,300 innocent Israelis killed, including at least 31 American citizens, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=332.88s)]
*  by the terrorist group Hamas. Hundreds, hundreds of young people at a music festival. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  The festival was for peace, for peace, gunned down as they ran for their lives. Scores of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  innocence from infants to elderly grandparents, Israelis and Americans taken hostage, children [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=353.04s)]
*  slaughtered, babies slaughtered, entire families massacred, rape, beheadings, bodies burned alive. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=359.36s)]
*  Mosque-committed atrocities that recall the worst ravages of ISIS, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=368.16s)]
*  unleashing pure, unadulterated evil upon the world. There's no rationalizing it, no excusing it, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=373.04s)]
*  period. The brutality we saw would have cut deep anywhere in the world, but it cuts deeper here [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=381.76s)]
*  in Israel. October 7th, which was sacred, a sacred Jewish holiday, became the deadliest day for the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=388.88s)]
*  Jewish people since the Holocaust. It has brought to the surface painful memories and scars left by [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=395.84s)]
*  millennia and to semitism and the genocide of the Jewish people. The world watched then, it knew, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=402.32s)]
*  and the world did nothing. We will not stand by and do nothing again. Not today, not tomorrow, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=412.08s)]
*  not ever. To those who are living in limbo, waiting desperately to learn the fate of a loved one, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=420.08s)]
*  especially to families of the hostages, you're not alone. We're working with partners throughout [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=426.48s)]
*  the region, pursuing every avenue to bring home those who are being helped captive by Hamas. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=433.12s)]
*  I can't speak publicly about all the details, but let me assure you, for me, as the American [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=440.4s)]
*  president, there's no higher priority than the release and safe return of all these hostages. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=445.6s)]
*  To those who are grieving a child, a parent, a spouse, a sibling, a friend, I know you feel [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=451.84s)]
*  like there's that black hole in the middle of your chest. You feel like you're being sucked into it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=458.0s)]
*  The survivors' remorse, the anger, the questions of faith in your soul, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=463.28s)]
*  starting at staring at that empty chair, sitting in shiva, the first Sabbath without them. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=467.12s)]
*  They're the everyday things, the small things that you miss the most. The scent when you open [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=473.44s)]
*  the closet door, the morning coffee you shared together, the bend of his smile, the perfect [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  picture of her laugh, the giggle of every little boy, the baby. For those who have lost loved ones, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=485.68s)]
*  this is what I know. They'll never be truly gone. There's something that's never fully lost. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=494.08s)]
*  Your love for them and their love for you. And I promise you, you'll be walking along some days [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=502.08s)]
*  and say, what would she or he want me to do? You smile when you pass a place that reminds you of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=506.8s)]
*  them. That's when you know. When a smile comes through your lips before a tear to your eye, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=513.92s)]
*  that's when you know you're going to fully make it. That's what will give you the fortitude to find [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=521.12s)]
*  light in the darkest hours. When terrorists believe they could bring you down, bend your will, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=526.16s)]
*  break your resolve, but they never did and they never will. Instead, we saw incredible stories of [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=533.52s)]
*  heroism and courage. Most Israelis taking care of one another. Neighbors forming watch groups to [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=540.4s)]
*  protect their kibbutz, opening their homes to shelter survivors, retired soldiers running into [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=546.32s)]
*  danger once again, civilian medics flying across rescue missions and off-duty medics at the music [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=553.6800000000001s)]
*  festival caring for the wounded before becoming a victim himself. Volunteers retrieving bodies of [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=562.32s)]
*  the dead so families could bury their loved ones in accordance with Jewish tradition. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=569.5200000000001s)]
*  Reservists leaving behind their families, their honeymoons, their studies abroad without hesitation [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=574.8s)]
*  and so much more. The state of Israel was born to be a safe place for the Jewish people of the world. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=585.76s)]
*  That's why I was born. I've long said if Israel didn't exist, we'd have to invent it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=594.88s)]
*  While it may not feel that way today, Israel must again be a safe place for the Jewish people. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=601.12s)]
*  And I promise you, we're gonna do everything in our power to make sure that it will be. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=607.6800000000001s)]
*  75 years ago, just 11 minutes after its founding, President Harry S. Truman and the United States [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=613.52s)]
*  of America became the first nation to recognize Israel. We've stood by your side ever since. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=621.6s)]
*  We're going to stand by your side now. My administration was in close touch with your [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=627.36s)]
*  leadership from the first moments of this attack. We're going to make sure we have what you need to [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=632.24s)]
*  protect your people to defend your nation. For decades, we've ensured Israel's qualitative [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=638.4s)]
*  military edge. And later this week, I'm going to ask the United States Congress for unprecedented [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=644.96s)]
*  support package for Israel's defense. We're going to keep Iron Dome fully supplied so it can [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=651.04s)]
*  continue standing sentinel over Israeli skies, saving Israeli lives. We've moved U.S. military [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  assets to the region, including positioning the USS Ford carrier strike group in eastern [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=664.4s)]
*  Mediterranean with the USS Eisenhower on the way to deter, to defer further aggression against [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  Israel, and to prevent this conflict from spreading. The world will know that Israel is [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=676.88s)]
*  stronger than ever. My message to any state or any other hostile actor, thinking about attacking [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=684.8s)]
*  Israel remains the same as it was a week ago. Don't. Don't. Don't. Since this terrorist attack [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=692.08s)]
*  took place, we've seen it described as Israel's 9-11. For a nation the size of Israel [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=701.2s)]
*  was like 15 9-11s. The scale may be different, but I'm sure those horrors [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=708.4000000000001s)]
*  have tapped into some kind of primal feeling in Israel just like it did and felt in the United [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=716.24s)]
*  States. Shock, pain, rage, an all-consuming rage, I understand and many Americans understand. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=721.36s)]
*  You can't look at what has happened here to your mothers, your fathers, your grandparents, sons, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=733.36s)]
*  daughters, children, even babies, and not scream out for justice. Justice must be done. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=739.8399999999999s)]
*  But I caution this while you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it. After 9-11, we were in [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=746.88s)]
*  rage in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=756.64s)]
*  I'm the first U.S. president to visit Israel in time of war. I've made wartime decisions. I know [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=763.36s)]
*  the choices are never clear or easy for the leadership. There's always cost, but it requires [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=770.48s)]
*  being deliberate. It requires asking very hard questions. It requires clarity about the objectives [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=777.6s)]
*  and an honest assessment about whether the path you're on will achieve those objectives. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=785.28s)]
*  The vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas. Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=791.6s)]
*  Hamas uses innocent families in Gaza as human shields, putting their command centers, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=799.9200000000001s)]
*  their weapons, their communications tunnels in residential areas. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=807.6s)]
*  Palestinian people are suffering greatly as well. The more the loss of innocent Palestinian lives [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=813.2s)]
*  like the entire world, I was outraged and saddened by the enormous loss of life yesterday in the [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=818.5600000000001s)]
*  hospital in Gaza. Based on the information we've seen today, it appears the result of an [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=824.0s)]
*  errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza. The United States unequivocally stands for the [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=829.36s)]
*  protection of civilian life during conflict, and I grieve, I truly grieve for the families [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=835.76s)]
*  who were killed or wounded by this tragedy. The people of Gaza need food, water, medicine, shelter. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=842.48s)]
*  Today, I asked the Israeli cabinet, who I've met with for some time this morning, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=849.2800000000001s)]
*  to agree to the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=853.5200000000001s)]
*  Based on the understanding that there will be inspections, that the aid should go to civilians, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=858.6400000000001s)]
*  not to Hamas, is it agreed humanitarian assistance can begin to move from Egypt to Gaza. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  Let me be clear, if Hamas diverts or steals the assistance, they will have demonstrated [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=871.6s)]
*  again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people, and it will end. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=878.4000000000001s)]
*  As a practical matter, it will stop the international community from being able to provide this aid. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=884.5600000000001s)]
*  We're working in close cooperation with the government of Egypt, the United Nations, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=892.96s)]
*  and its agencies like the World Program and other partners in the region to get trucks moving across [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=896.4000000000001s)]
*  the border as soon as possible. Separately, I ask Israel that the global community demand that [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=901.2s)]
*  the international Red Cross be able to visit hostages. I just demanded that the United States [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=908.6400000000001s)]
*  fully, I just demand that the United States fully supports. Today, I'm also announcing [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=914.96s)]
*  $100 million in new U.S. funding for humanitarian assistance in both Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=921.0400000000001s)]
*  This money will support more than $1 million displaced and conflict-affected Palestinians, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=927.92s)]
*  including emergency needs in Gaza. You are a Jewish state, you are a Jewish state, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=932.0799999999999s)]
*  but you're also a democracy. Like the United States, you don't live by the rules of terrorists, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=939.92s)]
*  you live by the rule of law. When conflicts flare, you live by the rule of law of wars. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=946.0s)]
*  What sets us apart from the terrorists is we believe in the fundamental dignity of every human life. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=951.76s)]
*  Israeli, Palestinian, Arab, Jew, Muslim, Christian, everyone. You can't give up what makes you who you [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=959.6s)]
*  are. If you give that up, then the terrorists win, and we can never let them win. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=968.08s)]
*  You know, Israel is a miracle, a triumph of faith and resolve and resilience [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=974.88s)]
*  over impossible pain and loss. Think about October 7th, the Jewish holiday, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=981.9200000000001s)]
*  when you read about the death of Moses, a tragic story of a profound loss to an entire nation, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=988.0s)]
*  a death that could have left a helpless hopelessness in the hearts of the entire nation. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=995.44s)]
*  But though Moses died, his memory, his message, his lessons have lived on for generations of [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1001.9200000000001s)]
*  the Jewish people as well as many others. And just as the memory of your loved ones will live on as [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1007.6800000000001s)]
*  well. After reading the story of Moses' death, those who observed the holiday began reading the Torah [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1012.72s)]
*  from the very beginning. The story of creation reminds us of two things. First, when we get [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1020.48s)]
*  knocked down, we get back up again, and we begin anew. And second, when we're faced with tragedy and [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  loss, we must go back to the beginning and remember who we are. We are all human beings, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1035.9199999999998s)]
*  creating an image of God with dignity, humanity, and purpose. In the darkness, to be the light [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1042.8s)]
*  unto the world is what we're about. You inspire hope and light for so many around the world. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1050.3999999999999s)]
*  That's what the terrorists seek to destroy. That's what they seek to destroy, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1057.76s)]
*  because they live in darkness, but not you, not Israel. Nations of conscience, like the United [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1063.84s)]
*  States and Israel, are not measured solely by the example of power. And we're measured by the power [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1071.44s)]
*  of our example. And that's why, as hard as it is, we must keep pursuing peace. We must keep pursuing [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1077.36s)]
*  a path so that Israel and the Palestinian people can both live safely, in security, in dignity, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1084.4s)]
*  and in peace. For me, that means a two-state solution. We must keep working for Israel's [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1090.8000000000002s)]
*  greater integration with its neighbors. These attacks only strengthen my commitment to determination [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1097.1200000000001s)]
*  and my will to get that done. I'm here to tell you, the terrorist will not win. Freedom will win. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1102.72s)]
*  So let me end where I began. Israel, you're not alone. The United States stands with you. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1111.2800000000002s)]
*  I've told the story before, and I'll tell it again, of my first meeting with an Israeli prime [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1119.3600000000001s)]
*  minister 50 years ago as a young senator. I was sitting across from Golda Meir at her desk in her [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1124.0s)]
*  office, and she had a guy named, a guy who later became prime minister, sit next to me. Just before [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1129.1200000000001s)]
*  the 1973 Yom Kippur War. And she flipped the maps up and down, telling me how bad things were, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1138.0s)]
*  and how terrible they were. All of a sudden, she looked at me, she said, would you like a photograph? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1145.2s)]
*  I looked at her, she got up from her desk and walked out into that hallway. I think it's marble [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1152.0s)]
*  flooring. Walked out on the hallway. We walked down, there were a bunch of photographers standing [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1157.84s)]
*  in front of us. We were standing shoulder to shoulder without her looking at me. She said to [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1163.04s)]
*  me, knowing I'd hear her, why do you look so worried, Senator Biden? And I said, worried? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1168.08s)]
*  Like, of course I'm worried. And she looked at me and she didn't look, she said, we don't worry, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1176.0s)]
*  Senator. We Israelis have a secret weapon. We have nowhere else to go. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1182.48s)]
*  Well, today, I say to all of Israel, the United States isn't going anywhere either. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1189.04s)]
*  We're going to stand with you. We'll walk beside you in those dark days. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1196.16s)]
*  We'll walk beside you in the good days to come. And they will come. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1200.96s)]
*  As you say in Hebrew, which I'm not going to attempt to do because I'm such a terrible [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1206.16s)]
*  linguist, I'll say it in English. The people of Israel live. The people of Israel live. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1211.1200000000001s)]
*  Israel will be safe, secure, Jewish and democratic state today, tomorrow, forever. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1220.32s)]
*  May God protect all those who work for peace. God save those who are still in harm's way. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1226.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1234.0s)]
*  You have been listening to President Joe Biden deliver remarks in Israel after meeting with [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1241.1200000000001s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, first American president to visit Israel during wartime [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1249.76s)]
*  and a speech there with messages for numerous audiences, first for Israel saying you are not [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1255.1200000000001s)]
*  alone, but also a warning for Israel not to be consumed by anger or by hate. We are joined here [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1260.32s)]
*  at the table again by Margaret Brennan and we've got reporters in the field. Margaret, I saw you [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1265.3600000000001s)]
*  taking notes as furiously as the rest of us. What stood out to you? Well, a number of things. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1269.76s)]
*  The first order of business was for him to reach out to the Israeli public as he did and said, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1274.48s)]
*  I'm with you. And then he quickly moved on to addressing the strike, said that that strike on [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1279.68s)]
*  that Gaza hospital was the work of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza. That was a U.S. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1285.04s)]
*  assessment. He put that aside. And what you put your finger on, I thought was very powerful, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1290.8s)]
*  that pivot he made to calling on the better angels of the nature of the democratic state [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1296.08s)]
*  of Israel to say don't be consumed by rage. He compared it to the mistakes the United States [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1302.8s)]
*  made after 9-11 with overreach. And I don't even have to go into laying out all of what was learned [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1308.1599999999999s)]
*  over the past decades. He also said justice must be done. I thought that was interesting. He said [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1314.3999999999999s)]
*  justice must be done, but you have to be deliberate. Yes. You have to be, it doesn't, it almost sounds [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1319.04s)]
*  like he was calling for restraint, but not calling for restraint. Bingo. Exactly what I thought. It [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1324.72s)]
*  was as close to calling for restraint as he could. He said you as a democracy live by the fundamental [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1329.3600000000001s)]
*  dignity of human life. You are not a terror group. So for those who say eye for an eye, he is saying [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1335.28s)]
*  you are held to a higher standard and you must hold yourselves. And that was an elegant way of saying [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1341.44s)]
*  be careful, slow down. As he said, justice must be done. My thought was [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1347.6000000000001s)]
*  peace needs to come before justice. And what does peace look like moving forward? Right. While we [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1354.3200000000002s)]
*  are in the midst of this war happening on a daily basis. The fog is so thick I don't know anyone can [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1359.76s)]
*  see it. Well he did make reference to the U.S. policy of standing by a two-state solution. That is [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1365.52s)]
*  the belief that Palestinians have a fundamental right to self-determination. Right. But that is [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1371.3600000000001s)]
*  not the policy of many Republican presidential candidates right now. That is not the policy of [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1377.3600000000001s)]
*  the prime minister of Israel right now or the cabinet that he had put together before this war [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1381.52s)]
*  cabinet. So that is actually in some ways a farther off solution on the horizon. But it's worth reminding [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1386.6399999999999s)]
*  people that the West Bank is governed by the Palestinian Authority and there is rage there [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1392.8s)]
*  about what is happening in Gaza. He had messages in that speech to the Palestinian people as well. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1398.0s)]
*  And I think in particular when he made reference to Israel as a country of laws including the laws [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1403.2s)]
*  of war. That is obviously a point of furious debate right now of whether Israel's gone beyond [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1408.64s)]
*  those laws or outside of them currently. And he's hoping I'm sure Gail I know we're going to go to [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1412.72s)]
*  Imtiaz that the Palestinians listening to that speech will also take a step back. Yeah. He had [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1417.5200000000002s)]
*  something for everyone in that speech. We want to go now to Imtiaz Tayef. He's in East Jerusalem. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1422.4s)]
*  He's been covering that hospital bombing in Gaza and the reaction from around the region. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1426.64s)]
*  Imtiaz good morning to you. What did you hear? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1431.1200000000001s)]
*  Good morning Gail. Well I think for those Palestinians who are out on the streets for those [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1433.44s)]
*  who are out protesting all across the region they did not hear what they wanted to hear which was [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1442.4s)]
*  President Biden condemned the violence inside the Gaza Strip. We've been seeing protests in cities [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1447.8400000000001s)]
*  like Beirut outside the U.S. embassy. Massive protests out there. And the reason they're [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1454.24s)]
*  protesting specifically outside the U.S. embassy is because they believe that because the U.S. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1459.84s)]
*  because the president hasn't condemned the kind of violence that we've been seeing inside Gaza [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1465.12s)]
*  that in some ways the U.S. is condoning the violence in Gaza. Now as we've been saying [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1471.44s)]
*  President Biden in that very wide-ranging speech was really trying to speak to everybody there [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1477.28s)]
*  but I think when we look at those images of those protests all across the region here that few people [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1482.8799999999999s)]
*  heard that and are still extraordinarily angry not only at what happened at that hospital but the [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1488.88s)]
*  fact that over the last 11 days over 3,000 Palestinians have been killed. But Imtiaz [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1494.48s)]
*  you say Palestinians will not hear what they wanted to hear but Joe Biden did say that the [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1501.6000000000001s)]
*  United States stands unequivocally opposed to civilian deaths in war and there was an offer of [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1508.5600000000002s)]
*  money aid to ease the burden and the suffering. Why in your view and I know you're in East [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1514.16s)]
*  Jerusalem there heavily heavily Palestinian area why might those words fall short or ring hollow [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1520.48s)]
*  for Palestinians? And he also said that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. I thought [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1526.8000000000002s)]
*  I thought that was a very key phrase and a very key message that he was sending. Yes. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1532.4s)]
*  And I think the phrase that many would resonate with many Palestinians who don't see Hamas [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1536.8s)]
*  representing them as well but I had a conversation with Hanan Ashrawi who is a very well-known figure [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1542.1599999999999s)]
*  an elder Palestinian state woman and she was in Washington in 1993 on the south lawn and that [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1548.72s)]
*  incredible historic moment where you had Bill Clinton standing there with Yasser Arafat and [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1556.0s)]
*  Yitzhak Ravine where they shook hands and it almost seemed as if we were in a war zone. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1560.24s)]
*  And it almost seemed as if we were close to Palestinian peace and here we are now 30 years [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1564.8s)]
*  later and Hanan Ashrawi essentially said that she's heard it all before from successive US [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1570.08s)]
*  president and I asked her do you have any hope about President Biden's visit and she said no [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1576.72s)]
*  she had no hope whatsoever and that and I'm quoting here he should just go home. All right [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1582.1599999999999s)]
*  MTS tie up for us 5,700 miles away back in Washington DC we have Edo Keefe our senior [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1588.8s)]
*  White House and political correspondent who's also been listening along here. Ed the president [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1594.16s)]
*  we've been saying all morning had a risky and complicated mission there it may not have been [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1598.48s)]
*  possible to accomplish it did he come close? We'll see the president was eager to make this trip [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1602.48s)]
*  after being invited by Israeli leadership and you can see in what he said especially at the beginning [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1609.68s)]
*  and at the end of this speech that he wanted to convey these messages to the Israeli people there [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1614.16s)]
*  in Israel the fact that he's not meeting in person with Arab leaders in Jordan later today [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1618.8000000000002s)]
*  as originally scheduled will be a disappointment but he is speaking with the Egyptian and Palestinian [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1623.76s)]
*  leadership on the phone on his flight back. The fact that there is now at least 100 million dollars [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1628.48s)]
*  in US aid for the Palestinian people will be met with immediate opposition up on Capitol Hill from [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1635.12s)]
*  Republicans who've been pretty clear that they don't want to see any aid potentially reach [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1642.24s)]
*  Gaza and reach the Hamas leadership so we'll wait and see about the details of when that gets there [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1646.96s)]
*  who exactly gets it and whether that makes it any easier to bring relief to those civilians [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1650.96s)]
*  and wait also to see for what exactly he's asking Congress to give in terms of money. Remember [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1655.92s)]
*  Congress itself isn't quite organized right now and so the scope and price of that project will [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1661.76s)]
*  probably depend on how quickly Congress can reorganize at least the House can reorganize [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1666.88s)]
*  and Republicans signal what they're willing to support. All right Ed you've had the last word [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1670.72s)]
*  on this subject for now we'll check in with you of course throughout the day. Margaret we thank you [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1674.96s)]
*  MTS Tyab thank you too. Our coverage of the President's visit to Israel will continue on [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1679.12s)]
*  CBS News streaming your local news and of course tonight on the CBS Evening News with Nora O'Donnell. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1684.0s)]
*  This has been a CBS News special report here in New York. I'm Gail King with Tony DiCoppola [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1689.4399999999998s)]

*  Please have a seat. We are continuing coverage of President Biden's [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1697.2s)]
*  visit to Israel. A moment ago he made remarks to reporters. CBS News correspondent Roxana Sibiri [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1712.16s)]
*  is in Tel Aviv. She was presumably listening to the President's remarks Roxana and I know I'm [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1718.32s)]
*  asking for your takeaways you're a reporter but the President's words will have a direct impact [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1724.8s)]
*  on all who have heard them Israeli and Palestinian. You are in Tel Aviv. What do you think the impact [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1731.76s)]
*  of the President's visit to Israel is? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUrXLQivJo&t=1739.44s)]
