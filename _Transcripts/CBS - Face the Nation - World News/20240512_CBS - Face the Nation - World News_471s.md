Video Description: Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who has been fiercely critical of the Biden administration's decision to pause a weapons shipment to Israel, tells "Face the Nation" that it is different from actions taken by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s." "Israel is fighting a war of survival against a terrorist group that committed the worst atrocity against Jews since World War II," he added.

# Sen. Tom Cotton says Israel is "fighting a war for survival against a terrorist group"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [May 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A)
*  And we're back now with Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, welcome back to the program. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=4.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  You just heard Secretary Blinken explain the administration's policy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  He says Hamas absolutely does not abide by international law. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=11.94s)]
*  Israel is inconsistent with international humanitarian law, but he stopped short of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=15.94s)]
*  saying they're violating weapons-sharing agreements. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=20.86s)]
*  Does this make sense to you? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=24.12s)]
*  No, it doesn't make any sense at all, Margaret. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=25.42s)]
*  It sounded like a bunch of weasely, mealy-mouth politics. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=27.36s)]
*  He said it's reasonable to assess. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=31.7s)]
*  He said that like three or four times. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=33.44s)]
*  It's like he was coached to say that as if it was some magic talisman to help them walk [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=34.56s)]
*  the political line they want between the pro-Hamas wing of their party and the vast pro-Israel [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=38.32s)]
*  majority of the American people. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=42.96s)]
*  The report that they put out Friday night after news deadlines passed was very clear. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=44.92s)]
*  There is no evidence that Israel is violating international law. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=49.96s)]
*  All civilian casualties in Gaza are solely the responsibility of Hamas. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=54.8s)]
*  In fact, Israel is probably doing more than any military in history to avoid civilian [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=58.44s)]
*  casualties. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=62.72s)]
*  Well, actually it says the U.S. intelligence community notes security forces in Israel [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=63.72s)]
*  have inflicted harm on civilians in military or security operations potentially using [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  U.S.-provided equipment. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=74.0s)]
*  U.S. assesses Israel could do more to avoid civilian harm. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=75.52s)]
*  So it doesn't say they're not doing it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=79.72s)]
*  It says they can't for some reason come to a clear conclusion. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=81.88s)]
*  Secretary Blinken's own report says there is no evidence that they can't reach that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=85.16s)]
*  conclusion. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=88.32s)]
*  Ben Cardin, the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee agrees that the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  report says there is no evidence. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=93.88s)]
*  In fact, he also says that Joe Biden was wrong to impose this de facto arms embargo [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  on Israel. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=100.56s)]
*  Again, Israel is doing more than any military in history in all likelihood to prevent civilian [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=101.56s)]
*  casualties. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=106.58s)]
*  If Hamas did not hide behind and under civilians, there would not be civilian casualties. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=107.72s)]
*  For that matter, if Hamas simply surrendered and turned over all these hostages, there [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=113.38s)]
*  would be no more civilian suffering in Gaza. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=117.32s)]
*  Which is what President Biden says as well. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=119.2s)]
*  But I mean, I know you're a lawyer. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=121.76s)]
*  You went to Harvard Law. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=123.36s)]
*  You were an army officer. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=124.48s)]
*  You deployed to Iraq. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=126.0s)]
*  You deployed to Afghanistan. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=127.12s)]
*  It has to trouble you when the Israeli prime minister says himself that they killed more [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=129.24s)]
*  civilians than terrorists, thousands more civilians than terrorists. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=133.84s)]
*  It troubles me deeply that Hamas is using those civilians as human shields because that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=137.6s)]
*  is their strategy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  Remember, Margaret, remember. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=144.24s)]
*  So should U.S. But to that point though, because the United States provides billions of dollars [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=145.24s)]
*  in weapons to Israel, should it have a say in how those weapons are used? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  Because the needle Lincoln seemed to be trying to thread here was to say it was very specifically [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=156.44s)]
*  in terms of withholding these large bombs, the 3500 bombs. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=163.84s)]
*  Well the reason Israel needs these larger bombs is because Hamas has buried tunnels [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=169.48s)]
*  where they're holding hostages and where its leaders are holed up deeply underground. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  They're also potentially delaying the kits that allow these so-called dumb bombs to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=177.98s)]
*  become smart precision bombs. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=182.56s)]
*  The J-Dumb kits that they're reviewing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=184.2s)]
*  And apparently, based on reports this morning, the administration even says they're withholding [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=185.96s)]
*  intelligence about the location of senior Hamas leaders and therefore hostages to include [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=189.98s)]
*  potentially American hostages from Israel to try to force Israel not to go into Ratha. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=195.42s)]
*  The White House denies that and John Kirby briefed the other day that the U.S. is sharing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  intelligence including the location of Yahya Sinwar who has not been killed in the seven [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  months of this war. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=210.62s)]
*  It was in the Washington Post with four officials familiar with it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=211.92s)]
*  The Washington Post is like the message board for this administration and the Democratic [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=216.14s)]
*  Party. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=219.58s)]
*  You believe that the intelligence community is withholding information from the Israeli military. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=220.58s)]
*  I believe that Joe Biden is willing to do that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=223.78s)]
*  Do you have any evidence of that? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=225.74s)]
*  I mean he's imposed a de facto arms embargo on Israel and sanctions on Israelis. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=226.74s)]
*  They're sending weapons this weekend. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=231.54000000000002s)]
*  That's not an arms embargo. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=233.02s)]
*  He just said last week that he's not going to send offensive weapons. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  We have no idea what he's going to withhold. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=237.5s)]
*  That was, as we just exchanged with Secretary Blinken, not a very clear statement in that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=240.46s)]
*  CNN interview. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=246.70000000000002s)]
*  But what Blinken said there was it was just that one single shipment. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=249.3s)]
*  You're saying you do not believe the Secretary of State when he says that? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=254.1s)]
*  Margaret, in March of 2022, Tony Blinken came on your show, this very show, and said the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=257.5s)]
*  United States would be perfectly fine to see fighter jets sent to Ukraine. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=263.02s)]
*  Joe Biden immediately reversed Tony Blinken's statement on this show. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=268.74s)]
*  So what Tony Blinken says on this show cannot be credited when Joe Biden is out there imposing [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=272.82s)]
*  a de facto arms embargo on Israel at the same time he's letting arms embargoes on Iran expire. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=277.18s)]
*  You know $26 billion in emergency funding was just approved by the president. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=283.82s)]
*  And there is not an arms embargo on Israel. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=289.3s)]
*  And there is not a block on intelligence sharing with Israel. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=292.18s)]
*  You know that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=294.86s)]
*  Joe Biden said last week that he's going to stop supplying offensive weapons that can [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=296.42s)]
*  be used in an urban setting. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=300.02s)]
*  That is the only setting in Gaza. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=301.62s)]
*  That is the only setting in Gaza. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=304.5s)]
*  And they have to go into Ra'a. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=307.42s)]
*  Joe Biden's position is de facto for Hamas victory at this point. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=309.66s)]
*  Israel's goal is to destroy Hamas, which committed the worst atrocity against Jews since World War II. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=314.42s)]
*  Hamas' goal is to survive. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=319.94s)]
*  If Israel does not go into Ra'a and destroy Hamas in Ra'a, Hamas will survive. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=322.14s)]
*  Well the Biden administration says they can go into Ra'a, that's how they do it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=327.34s)]
*  I want to ask you more broadly because people like Senator Van Han, who is going to be on here, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=330.82s)]
*  will talk about the principle and the spirit and the meaning of U.S. law. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=336.82s)]
*  And you know that past presidents have withheld military aid to Israel to force changes in behavior. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  President Reagan did that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=349.58s)]
*  President Bush did that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=351.09999999999997s)]
*  Why do you have a problem with President Biden doing it? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=352.74s)]
*  Well first off when you talk about the principle and the spirit of U.S. law, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  it sounds to me like they are not talking about the letter of U.S. law [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=359.62s)]
*  because Tony Blinken's own report concluded they did not violate U.S. law. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=363.02000000000004s)]
*  Ronald Reagan's decision to pause the delivery of fighter jets in the 1980s was totally different [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=367.02000000000004s)]
*  from what has happened here. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=372.86s)]
*  Israel is fighting a war of survival against a terrorist group that committed the worst atrocity [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=374.90000000000003s)]
*  against Jews since World War II. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=380.1s)]
*  In the 1980s an Israeli ambassador had been targeted for assassination. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=381.98s)]
*  Ronald Reagan knew the pause of fighter jets would not interfere with Israel's fighting [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=386.74s)]
*  because they had plenty of fighters. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=390.53999999999996s)]
*  He did not pause munitions. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=391.97999999999996s)]
*  Joe Biden is not sending munitions in the middle of a shooting war that is a war of survival. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=393.34s)]
*  And look at the broader context. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=398.94s)]
*  Israel knew that Ronald Reagan had its back in the region. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=400.86s)]
*  He sank half of Iran's navy. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=403.82s)]
*  Joe Biden has consistently given Iran hundreds of billions of dollars of sanctions relief [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  that exactly funded groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=411.26s)]
*  And they are still sending weapons. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=415.14s)]
*  But last month Donald Trump told Time magazine, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=417.14s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu rightfully has been criticized for what took place on October 7th. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=420.14s)]
*  Do you agree with that assessment? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=425.14s)]
*  Are you comfortable with any criticism of the prime minister? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=427.14s)]
*  I think Prime Minister Netanyahu and other senior Israeli leaders have acknowledged [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=430.14s)]
*  they have responsibility for the failures on October 7th. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=433.14s)]
*  And they've said, as is the Israeli custom, when this war is over [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=436.14s)]
*  they will have to go to the commission of inquiry to figure out exactly what went wrong [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=440.14s)]
*  to ensure it doesn't happen again. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=443.14s)]
*  But President Trump said just last night that he would absolutely provide Israel [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=445.14s)]
*  with the weapons they need to finish the job. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=449.14s)]
*  This would have never happened on President Trump's watch. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=451.14s)]
*  It didn't happen on his watch. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=454.14s)]
*  And if he were president this war would have probably already been over [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=456.14s)]
*  with much less civilian suffering in Gaza [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=460.14s)]
*  because he would have backed Israel to the hilt from the beginning. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=462.14s)]
*  Well, that's a debate on counterfactuals for another day, Senator. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=465.14s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=469.14s)]
*  I'm going to have you here in person. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=470.14s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg-KXw1Iq8A&t=472.14s)]
