# Cuban deputy foreign minister discusses state of U.S. relations and more | full interview
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8)
*  Vice Minister, thank you for your time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=0.0s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1.6s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be here. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=2.6s)]
*  Let's jump right in. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=3.6s)]
*  The U.S. and Cuba are beginning these new rounds of negotiations over migration and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  border policy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=9.8s)]
*  What are you asking from the U.S.? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=11.4s)]
*  Well, truly, we're not beginning now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  We've had bilateral migration agreements since 1984. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=16.04s)]
*  There are several of them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=20.36s)]
*  And regularly, we meet. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=22.12s)]
*  At some points, the U.S. government has refused during several years, like the last two years [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=24.0s)]
*  of the Trump administration, to meet. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=29.32s)]
*  But it has been a regular scenario for meeting and discussing the issue of migration. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=31.52s)]
*  The amount of Cubans that already live in the United States or that migrate to the United [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=37.88s)]
*  States is significant for the size of Cuba, which is common in Latin America. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=43.08s)]
*  And we're neighboring countries. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=48.68s)]
*  So it's only natural for us to meet. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=49.68s)]
*  And the commitment that we both have since 1984 is to ensure that migration between the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  two countries is regular, it's secure, and it's stable, that it's not an irregular or [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=58.76s)]
*  illegal migration. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=66.64s)]
*  And that's the reason why we have accords. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=68.68s)]
*  What we want both sides is for the agreements to be met. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=71.56s)]
*  Now, a major point for Cuba is to tackle the causes of that migration. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=75.2s)]
*  And there are several which are common to countries in the region. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=82.53999999999999s)]
*  There's a more developed and attractive economic capacity in the United States than in Latin [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=85.4s)]
*  American countries. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=91.28s)]
*  There are issues like COVID that depress economic conditions for some countries. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=92.28s)]
*  But there's one extraordinary factor which is peculiar or singular to Cuba, and that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=97.0s)]
*  is a policy by the United States conceived and implemented to depress the standard of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=102.92s)]
*  living of Cubans. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=108.64000000000001s)]
*  To destroy the way to ensure the means of the subsistence and to try to destroy the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=110.6s)]
*  capacity of the Cuban economy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=118.96s)]
*  That in itself provokes people wanting to remove themselves and to move to the United [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=121.08s)]
*  States. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=125.83999999999999s)]
*  If you add to that, that the United States has had for decades incentives which are only [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=126.84s)]
*  for Cuba, special for Cuba, by which they are accepted regardless of the reason why [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=133.04s)]
*  they migrate. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=137.96s)]
*  And then they have a speedy way of becoming residents in the United States. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=139.16s)]
*  Then you have a magnet in the United States for people who, because of the economic conditions, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=142.8s)]
*  want to leave Cuba. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  You're talking about the Cuban Adjustment Act. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  The Cuban Adjustment Act, but also the privileged treatment that Cubans get at the border. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=150.12s)]
*  And it's not that we are against Cubans having privileges. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=156.12s)]
*  Of course we're not. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=158.88s)]
*  But if it becomes an incentive for irregular and disorderly migration, it creates problems [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=160.32s)]
*  for both countries. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=166.32s)]
*  And both have admitted that we need to solve that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=168.12s)]
*  But only the U.S. Congress can change the Cuban Adjustment Act because it is a law, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=170.76s)]
*  not an administration policy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=174.8s)]
*  That's a Cuban Adjustment Act. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=176.52s)]
*  But the execution of the policy at the border that makes Cubans believe and be aware that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=178.2s)]
*  if they do reach the southern border by sea or by land, they have a very, very good capacity [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=186.24s)]
*  or possibilities of entering the United States, at least highly superior than the national [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=193.44s)]
*  of any other country in the world. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=198.6s)]
*  So what specific immigration policies, Deputy Minister, are you asking the U.S. to implement [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=200.2s)]
*  as it relates to Cubans? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=204.96s)]
*  Part of the commitments in the agreement is for there not to be a privileged position. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=206.68s)]
*  So that migrants that reach the border without a visa and try to cross irregularly into the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=211.92s)]
*  United States, they should be returned to Cuba. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=218.44s)]
*  It doesn't happen in a great manner. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=220.92s)]
*  We're also asking the United States to stop a policy that pushes Cubans to leave the country. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  That's why it is impossible not to make a connection between a policy aimed at depressing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=231.0s)]
*  the Cuban economy and having a large flow of Cubans wanting to leave. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=237.48s)]
*  You're talking about the embargo. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=240.48s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=241.48s)]
*  We'll get to that in a minute. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=242.48s)]
*  Before we get to that, a long-time U.S. demand on migration for Cuba has been for your government [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=244.04s)]
*  to accept more migrants returned from the U.S., deportation flights. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=249.52s)]
*  Are you open to agreeing to accepting more deportation flights? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=253.8s)]
*  I believe there's only one per month right now going to Cuba. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=256.92s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=260.56s)]
*  It's a commitment that we have. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=263.36s)]
*  It's not that we are open to it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=264.36s)]
*  It's a commitment written in the agreements and it's being implemented. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=265.92s)]
*  But you have to look, implement the agreements in a comprehensive manner. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=269.88s)]
*  Since April of last year, the U.S. has been sending planes. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  In September of the previous year, of 2022, we said, okay, let's begin the return flights. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  They truly began in April. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=283.96s)]
*  There has been one a month. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=285.64s)]
*  But we are open to having more if the U.S. is ready to. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=286.64s)]
*  You are open to having more deportation flights? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=289.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=290.79999999999995s)]
*  More than one a month? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=292.79999999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=293.79999999999995s)]
*  Has the U.S. asked for that? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  They've asked and we said yes, but they continue to do it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  As you know, U.S.-Cuba relations can be very contentious and they have been over the past [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=300.4s)]
*  60 years or so. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=305.4s)]
*  It seems like migration is an area where there could be some agreement. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=307.92s)]
*  Do you expect a new agreement to be brokered after these rounds of talks? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=312.16s)]
*  We don't think we need a new agreement. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=317.0s)]
*  We believe that with the existing ones, if we work together, implement it comprehensively, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  and if we try to tackle the causes of migration, I think that we can control, curtail the big [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=326.8s)]
*  flows and ensure the commitment that we both have. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=334.24s)]
*  We're open to having a new agreement, but perhaps we don't need to sign a new agreement [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=338.56s)]
*  or negotiate one. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=342.08s)]
*  Should we expect any new announcements this week? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=344.04s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=346.52s)]
*  There's no need for it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=347.52s)]
*  Because the meetings take place not to negotiate new agreements, but to assess the implementation, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=349.12s)]
*  to make position on workshops, on specific areas, because the agreements entail cooperation [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  between coast guards and Cuban border guards. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=361.4s)]
*  It entails communications to make sure that they're functioning well. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  How do you establish a coordination or cooperation if you have capsized, if you have to do search [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  and rescue, if you have extra continental aliens trying to use Cuba to migrate to the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=374.76s)]
*  United States? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=380.23999999999995s)]
*  What's the impact on third countries, Central American countries, and Mexico? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=381.23999999999995s)]
*  All those issues need to be discussed as part of the implementation of the agreements. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=384.56s)]
*  Since the start of fiscal year of 2021, nearly half a million Cubans have been processed [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=389.16s)]
*  at the U.S.-Mexico border, a record and extraordinary figure. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  What is driving so many Cubans to leave the island? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  We'll go back a little. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=401.04s)]
*  In 2014, 2015, 2016, the U.S. government introduced very limited exceptions to the U.S. economic [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  blogger that gains Cuba. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=413.04s)]
*  The Cuban economy improved. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=414.84s)]
*  Life in Cuba was more dynamic, and migration dropped. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=417.52s)]
*  So there's evidently a direct link between the policy of making life difficult for Cubans [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=422.91999999999996s)]
*  and migration. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=429.4s)]
*  The U.S. government has, and high officials in the U.S. government have acknowledged, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=431.4s)]
*  not speaking of Cuba, but speaking generally of Central America and Latin America, that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=436.91999999999996s)]
*  the social economic conditions of the country's origin are a pushing factor. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=440.88s)]
*  And therefore, the United States needs to invest to help those countries in improving [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=445.56s)]
*  their economic conditions. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=451.04s)]
*  Cuba is an exception. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=452.92s)]
*  In the case of Cuba, instead of helping, the U.S. is aiming at destroying the Cuban economy. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=453.92s)]
*  So that is a good way to explain why Cubans migrate. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=459.84s)]
*  Also, the U.S. is not processing visitor visas in Cuba, non-immigrant visas. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=463.8s)]
*  There's a lot of connection between Cubans that live in the United States and Cubans [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=470.56s)]
*  that continue, and their families in Cuba. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=473.68s)]
*  So many people want to visit both sides. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=476.12s)]
*  If there's no possibility of having a visitor visa, some Cubans, a group that we can't [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=478.44s)]
*  estimate number, try to apply for residency in the United States so that they can go back [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=487.8s)]
*  and forth easily without requiring a visa and having to go to Mexico or to the Dominican [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=493.34000000000003s)]
*  Republic or to another third country to try to get their visa processed, to visit their [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=499.35999999999996s)]
*  family, to go and purchase something, to visit the United States. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  For those that have small private businesses to try to look for supplements or inputs for [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=508.44s)]
*  their business, all that is limited because their visitor visa is not being processed [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=515.16s)]
*  in Cuba. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=519.4s)]
*  And this is linked to the amount of people that want to establish permanent residency [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=520.4s)]
*  in the United States, even if their plan is not to permanently live in the United States. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=525.88s)]
*  Right now, Cubans seeking non-immigrant visas have to travel to a third country to be processed. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=530.52s)]
*  Are you asking the U.S. to process those cases in Cuba? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=535.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=538.4s)]
*  You are. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=539.4s)]
*  We've been asking that for... [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=540.4s)]
*  What has the response been? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=541.4s)]
*  That they need to put the infrastructure in place, that it will occur, but it hasn't [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=542.4s)]
*  occurred. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  That it will occur at some point? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=545.5600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  That has been their response. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  I know your argument is that the exodus from Cuba is mainly a result of the embargo and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=550.4s)]
*  U.S. sanction policies, but also U.S. immigration policy that you say attracts Cubans to migrate [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=556.88s)]
*  to the U.S. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=563.24s)]
*  But the Department of Homeland Security says that one of the reasons that so many Cubans [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=565.0s)]
*  have left is because of repressive policies and because of economic mismanagement in Cuba. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=570.36s)]
*  What do you respond to that argument? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=576.6s)]
*  We appreciate that Homeland Security acknowledges that at least the U.S. policy and the economic [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=579.52s)]
*  blockade policy is one of the factors. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=585.8s)]
*  But let's look at economic mismanagement. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=588.16s)]
*  Economics management is a reality of any country in the world. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=590.28s)]
*  I'm sure that if you poll Americans today in an electoral year and you ask them about [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=592.8s)]
*  their feelings of how the economy is going, you will have some significant numbers that [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=597.64s)]
*  say they're not happy. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=601.48s)]
*  And I've seen some of the polls being published. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=603.68s)]
*  If you go around Latin America, you can find that. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  So it's a common issue around the world. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=608.52s)]
*  And I won't argue if it's being managed well, managed or mismanaged in Cuba. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=611.0s)]
*  But as any country, we could have problems of management. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=614.8s)]
*  Then repressive policy, you speak. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=618.24s)]
*  Well, the United States has repressive policies also of many types, including limitations [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=619.96s)]
*  and repression for Americans regarding Cuba, prohibiting them to travel to Cuba, telling [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=626.1999999999999s)]
*  them if they do travel, which is a permit and what they can do, what they cannot do, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=630.76s)]
*  where they can stay, where they cannot stay. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=636.2s)]
*  To try to sell something in Cuba, to explore a business, you have to ask permission to [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=638.16s)]
*  the U.S. government. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=642.48s)]
*  It's unique. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=643.8000000000001s)]
*  No other country in the world, you need that level of permission from the U.S. government [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  to interact. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=648.36s)]
*  So there's a repression in the United States. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=649.36s)]
*  But what's extraordinary, what's specific for Cuba and peculiar for Cuba is a policy [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=652.24s)]
*  that is over six decades old aimed by definition of depressing the standard of living of the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=658.08s)]
*  population. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=665.24s)]
*  You can speak about other factors, but if you have a consistent policy by the most powerful [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=666.6800000000001s)]
*  economy in the world to try to destroy the livelihood of a whole population, 11 million [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=671.08s)]
*  Cubans, it is logical to expect people, a segment of the population, to want to leave [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=677.0s)]
*  the country. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=681.84s)]
*  And that can change by a decision from the U.S. government. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=682.84s)]
*  If it stops, and you could test it, they could test it for a year and a half or two years [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=686.12s)]
*  and remove the economic blockade and we'll see what it means. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  This is what the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on the exodus from Cuba. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=695.68s)]
*  Cuba's deteriorating economic conditions and political repression continue to increasingly [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=700.48s)]
*  drive Cubans out of their country. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=704.92s)]
*  As a result, many have taken dangerous journeys to reach the United States. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=706.92s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=710.88s)]
*  Do you disagree with that? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=711.88s)]
*  It's a very incomplete assessment. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=712.88s)]
*  Do you acknowledge that policies in Cuba may be playing a role in addition to the embargo [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=718.0s)]
*  and U.S. policies? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=723.4s)]
*  I totally disagree with that, but I don't disagree that that could be the view of homeland [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=724.4s)]
*  security. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=729.04s)]
*  But I totally disagree. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=730.04s)]
*  The fundamental factor is that there could be others. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=731.04s)]
*  People have families in the United States. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=734.88s)]
*  The U.S. economy is more prosperous than the Cuban economy. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=736.68s)]
*  A salary in the United States is higher. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=739.4s)]
*  But that's the same problem of any country. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=741.84s)]
*  Go the list down, Latin America and the Caribbean, and you have a similar population. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=744.72s)]
*  More than half of the population of Puerto Rico has left Puerto Rico. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=749.2800000000001s)]
*  Does the United States say that it's a result of repressive U.S. policy? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=753.72s)]
*  Does it say that it's mismanaged by the U.S. or the economy of Puerto Rico? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=758.08s)]
*  More than half. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=762.2s)]
*  Not a third of the Cuban population has not left Cuba. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=764.12s)]
*  The analysis made and the argument made by homeland security is trying to avoid the factor [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=768.48s)]
*  that the U.S. has a policy of destroying the livelihood of Cuban people with a specific [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=774.08s)]
*  aim to try to have social and political instability in the country for political aims. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=779.5600000000001s)]
*  But there's an additional result of that, is people just leaving the country. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=787.0400000000001s)]
*  And you do that to a city in the United States, you do that to a community, you do that to [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=791.9200000000001s)]
*  a state in the United States, and you will have the same impact. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=796.32s)]
*  U.S. officials would point to the fact that just in March we saw hundreds of Cubans take [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=800.96s)]
*  to the streets clamoring for food and electricity as a basis to say that it is Cuban policy [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=805.24s)]
*  that is driving people to leave. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=813.6800000000001s)]
*  I know they would say that, but again, they don't have the courage of saying that the [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=816.48s)]
*  U.S. has a policy of depriving Cuba of the supplies of fuel that we need for electricity. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=820.88s)]
*  It's an explicit policy that's being implemented. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=828.4s)]
*  So if you have lack of electricity and you have the most powerful government in the world [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=831.4s)]
*  trying to deprive you from the legitimate supply of fuel, then how can you speak and [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=836.52s)]
*  criticize that Cubans peacefully, because it was a peaceful protest, protested for the [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=843.08s)]
*  lack of fuel. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=847.48s)]
*  The United States has a standing policy supported by law of going after every commercial and [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=849.6s)]
*  financial transaction of Cuba in every corner of the world, which includes our capacity [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=855.68s)]
*  and our efforts to provide food or the inputs that we need for agriculture to produce food. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=861.12s)]
*  So if we have inability to provide in a system of social justice, subsidized food, which [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=866.28s)]
*  is what people were protesting, subsidized food, because of the limitations we have in [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=874.76s)]
*  our foreign trade, the United States should acknowledge first that there are problems [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=880.64s)]
*  with electricity, and the U.S. is helping for that problem to happen. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=885.12s)]
*  That we have problems with food. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=888.92s)]
*  The U.S. is making a great effort for us to have problems with food. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=890.24s)]
*  And it did not say, it did not have the courage nor the honesty to say that the U.S. wished [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=894.28s)]
*  for those protests not to be peaceful. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=902.24s)]
*  Their aim was for them to be violent. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=905.68s)]
*  Have you been surprised, Deputy Minister, that the Biden administration has not followed [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=908.2s)]
*  the footsteps of the Obama administration and tried to normalize relations with Cuba? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=913.44s)]
*  I think many people are surprised. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=917.9200000000001s)]
*  The Biden administration, when the elections of 2020, committed not to Cuba, but to U.S. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=920.44s)]
*  electors, that he would undo the steps of maximum pressure applied by the Trump government. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=927.96s)]
*  And he said that he would do it swiftly. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=936.48s)]
*  It's in the program with which the Democratic Party went to the elections. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=939.2s)]
*  It hasn't happened. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=943.64s)]
*  They've been promising us in bilateral talks that that would change. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=944.64s)]
*  And I can tell you more, no official of the U.S. government, and I've spoken to many, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=949.72s)]
*  has been able to give me a reasonable understanding or reasonable argument that they believe that [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=955.04s)]
*  Cuba is a country that sponsors terrorism. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=962.92s)]
*  Because it's ridiculous to say so. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=965.6s)]
*  Cuba in any case is a victim of terrorism. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=967.0s)]
*  Yet saying that Cuba is a country sponsor of terrorism, putting it on the list of the [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=969.9200000000001s)]
*  State Department, automatically unleashes an important set of sanctions and threats [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=976.0400000000001s)]
*  to anyone around the world that engages with Cuba. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=982.2s)]
*  That puts a great pressure on our economy, including tourism, because it intimidates [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=985.48s)]
*  Europeans, for example, and some citizens of Latin America, if they travel to Cuba, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=991.4s)]
*  by telling that if they do that, they run the risk of not being accepted in the United [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=997.28s)]
*  States, which is a direct shot at Cuba's main source of income, which is tourism. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1000.88s)]
*  The Biden administration would argue, of course, that one of the reasons that it has not fully [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1005.8000000000001s)]
*  normalized relations with Cuba is because they believe that your government is committing [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1009.76s)]
*  human rights abuses and that you're cracking down on dissidents. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1014.36s)]
*  Well, we will say that we have also disagreements with the United States. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1018.24s)]
*  And it's no secret that we are very critical of US support for the crimes that are being [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1022.6800000000001s)]
*  committed in Palestine today. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1028.08s)]
*  Over 32,000 Palestinians are being killed, including a third of them women and children. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1030.8s)]
*  And the United States is an active participant in that, providing weapons, providing resources, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1036.4s)]
*  and providing international support for that to occur, regardless of what they say. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1041.28s)]
*  So we have disagreements. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1045.64s)]
*  But we have told the US government, why do we sit down and discuss about these issues? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1047.26s)]
*  Let's talk about human rights in both countries. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1051.22s)]
*  Frankly, we also have very concerns in the United States. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1054.3s)]
*  Let's talk about prisoners. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1057.34s)]
*  Let's talk about the amount of prisoners that exist in the United States, the conditions [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1059.06s)]
*  of prisons in the United States. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1062.42s)]
*  And we'll talk about the conditions of prisoners and of prisons in Cuba. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1063.94s)]
*  But it has to be a bilateral and respectful conversation. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1068.06s)]
*  Cuba is not a colony of the United States. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1073.02s)]
*  Could there be an exchange? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1075.7s)]
*  It's not a defeated country. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1077.14s)]
*  So it could be an exchange. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1078.14s)]
*  We can exchange many things. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1079.3400000000001s)]
*  You're open to that. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1080.3400000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1081.3400000000001s)]
*  We've told them, let's sit down. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1082.3400000000001s)]
*  Let's have a dialogue on human rights. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1083.3400000000001s)]
*  There has been no answer by the US. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1084.98s)]
*  Are you concerned that the US may impose additional economic sanctions against Cuba if President [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1087.48s)]
*  Trump wins in November? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1093.5800000000002s)]
*  He has a different Cuba policy than President Biden. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1095.3s)]
*  Of course, we're concerned if there are additional economic wars and measures in Cuba, regardless [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1098.3s)]
*  of who wins the election. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1103.96s)]
*  The Biden administration has very faithfully applied the policies put in place by the Trump [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1106.02s)]
*  administration and added some. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1111.5s)]
*  So we were not surprised they would do it. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1114.18s)]
*  It would be unfair. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1116.64s)]
*  We believe it will be immoral. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1118.8s)]
*  But we have to acknowledge that would happen and gives us room for concern. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1120.6200000000001s)]
*  I also want to ask you about the so-called Havana syndrome cases. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1124.82s)]
*  The US intelligence community here has assessed that it is unlikely that any foreign adversary, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1128.6200000000001s)]
*  such as Cuba or Russia, is behind this phenomenon. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1133.74s)]
*  But our colleagues at 60 Minutes have reported that Russia may be orchestrating this. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1138.02s)]
*  Do you know anything about that? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1143.34s)]
*  And has Cuba investigated this? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1144.78s)]
*  We investigated this seven years ago. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1147.28s)]
*  We came to the similar conclusion based on science, based on objective information, seven [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1150.24s)]
*  years ago. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1156.84s)]
*  We know that the FBI back in 2017 came to the same conclusion in the first research [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1158.14s)]
*  they made, which has never been made public. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1165.7800000000002s)]
*  But we saw a report at the time, 2017. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1167.66s)]
*  So all this is a fable, trying to use it for politics, for creating threats. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1171.94s)]
*  There's no proof whatsoever that something like this can happen. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1180.3000000000002s)]
*  And I would say more. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1184.54s)]
*  The scientific community of Cuba, very important people of the scientific community in the [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1185.62s)]
*  United States have argued and have published books based on research that what is being [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1191.7s)]
*  claimed that happened cannot occur as a matter of physics, pure physics. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1197.3s)]
*  So this is a fable that comes up every now and then. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1202.28s)]
*  I saw the 60 Minute Report. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1205.1399999999999s)]
*  There's no science there. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1206.74s)]
*  They're saying that somebody says that they might have felt with no proof, no demonstration, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1208.06s)]
*  no physical or scientific explanation of what people are claiming that is beyond what [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1214.4s)]
*  could have been normal diseases. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1220.8000000000002s)]
*  So the US government, you believe, has already investigated this and has come to a conclusion [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1222.64s)]
*  and you saw some findings. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1228.0800000000002s)]
*  Can you share what those were? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1229.92s)]
*  Well, they have made public that the intelligence community found that it was very improbable [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1231.6000000000001s)]
*  because there was no basis to it, that a foreign adversary could have carried out what is being [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1237.8000000000002s)]
*  claimed. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1243.0800000000002s)]
*  It's public, it's being said. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1244.28s)]
*  Why would Cuba have to support that? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1245.76s)]
*  I think the US intelligence community has more authority than what we're going to say [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1248.24s)]
*  for Americans. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1252.1999999999998s)]
*  And when it conducted its investigation, your government found what about this? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1253.8799999999999s)]
*  That the symptoms that were being described, first, we don't question that people could [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1259.32s)]
*  have been ill. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1265.46s)]
*  We have never questioned that there are diplomats or staff at the US embassy that could have [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1267.8799999999999s)]
*  felt some symptoms of illness. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1272.84s)]
*  We never had the chance to interview any of them because the US government did not allow [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1275.44s)]
*  it. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1279.2s)]
*  We did not have the chance to speak to the doctors that treated them because the US government [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1280.2s)]
*  refused to. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1284.68s)]
*  But based on our analysis, based on what we knew, you have to remember this began as accusation [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1285.68s)]
*  that these were sonic attacks. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1291.8s)]
*  At some point, they said that were cicadas that did this. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1295.04s)]
*  At some point, it was so unbelievable that the whole theory changed to brain damage based [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1298.32s)]
*  on a concussion without a concussion having occurred. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1305.76s)]
*  And speaking of microwave, hyperwave, different types of information, that was impossible [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1309.1599999999999s)]
*  to occur. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1317.8s)]
*  Saying that a microwave ray could be able to create a damage, specific type of damage [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1318.8s)]
*  in the brain, people would say your head would have to burn for that. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1324.8s)]
*  So you don't think Russia is behind this? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1327.76s)]
*  I don't think anyone's behind it. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1329.44s)]
*  I don't think there's a syndrome. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1331.36s)]
*  Any country? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1332.68s)]
*  I don't think there's a syndrome. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1334.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1336.4s)]
*  There have also been conflicting statements about Cubans traveling to Europe to fight [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1337.4s)]
*  on Russia's behalf in Ukraine. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1342.72s)]
*  Are you opposed to this happening? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1346.16s)]
*  And if so, are you doing anything to stop it? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1347.96s)]
*  The news about this came out by a statement of the Cuban government. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1350.76s)]
*  In the end of August or beginning of September of 2023, it was Cuba that raised this issue [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1356.76s)]
*  publicly when we learned that Cubans living in Europe, in Russia and outside of Russia, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1361.4s)]
*  were being recruited to participate in the war. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1370.52s)]
*  And also that through the social networks, there were people in Russia trying to recruit [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1374.64s)]
*  Cubans leaving the country. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1381.0s)]
*  Our government came out very strongly that we oppose this, and we oppose it in two ways. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1383.52s)]
*  The person who does the trafficking by recruiting, but also the participants, because there are [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1388.8799999999999s)]
*  laws in Cuba against mercenaries, very strong laws. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1394.28s)]
*  So there are people in Cuba that have been detained. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1399.08s)]
*  There are people in jail because of this. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1400.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know the figures. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1402.4s)]
*  We have a very strong position against that. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1403.76s)]
*  We also know that there have been Cubans fighting from the Ukraine side against Russia. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1406.8799999999999s)]
*  But for all cases, we oppose Cubans living in Cuba and participating in foreign wars. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1412.8s)]
*  And we know that a whole legend has been created after Cuba made this announcement, where I [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1419.72s)]
*  can confirm that we have a very strong position against the participation of Cubans in any [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1425.36s)]
*  foreign war. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1431.32s)]
*  Manuel Rocha, a longtime U.S. official and diplomat, recently pled guilty to spying for [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1432.32s)]
*  the Cuban government. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1438.32s)]
*  That is at least what he conceded in court. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1439.48s)]
*  Is it true that he was a spy for your government? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1444.8799999999999s)]
*  And if so, are you concerned about any information that he made this close now that he's cooperating [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1447.52s)]
*  with the U.S. authorities? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1453.6399999999999s)]
*  What I know about this is what has been published in the news. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1455.4399999999998s)]
*  And what I also know is that there's no country in the world that spies more than the United [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1459.52s)]
*  States. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1464.12s)]
*  We've got the strongest agencies, espionage agencies, that do more than spying. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1465.12s)]
*  They do dirtier things than spying. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1469.28s)]
*  And I am also sure that one of the countries that is most spied in the world is Cuba by [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1471.56s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1476.7199999999998s)]
*  That's what I can know about this. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1477.7199999999998s)]
*  U.S. officials say, though, that there is a Chinese government spy base inside Cuba [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1478.7199999999998s)]
*  and that there are Chinese spies spying there from your country and your territory. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1484.84s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1490.28s)]
*  So doesn't that jeopardize your objective of getting a normalization of relations with [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1491.44s)]
*  the U.S. and getting these economic sanctions lifted? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1495.84s)]
*  Cuba is a relatively small country and there were a hundred diplomatic missions in Cuba. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1500.28s)]
*  None of them have ever seen, including a U.S. embassy, a spy station or any similar to that, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1506.32s)]
*  or a Chinese squad or platoon or anything of the sort. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1513.6399999999999s)]
*  So you're denying that there's a Chinese spy base in Cuba? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1517.52s)]
*  Let me continue. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1520.2s)]
*  There are several important news organizations with permanent presence in Cuba. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1521.6s)]
*  None of them has ever seen it. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1526.68s)]
*  We have been adamant publicly saying that there's no Chinese base in Cuba. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1528.84s)]
*  Now, that said, Cuba has a right to have military cooperation with any country. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1535.04s)]
*  And in addition to that, I have to say that Cuba is signatory to a declaration of Latin [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1542.1599999999999s)]
*  America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1548.3999999999999s)]
*  So we discourage the presence of foreign military bases in any country in the region. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1551.8s)]
*  We can't criticize countries that do it, but we discourage it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1557.6399999999999s)]
*  We do have a military foreign presence in our country in the province of Guantanamo, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1560.72s)]
*  which is a military base of the U.S. against the will of the Cuban people. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1566.24s)]
*  But I can assure you, there's no, outside of the Guantanamo military base, there's no [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1570.08s)]
*  foreign military base in Cuba of any country. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_rSzIHyDD8&t=1576.2s)]
