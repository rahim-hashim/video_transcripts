# Palestinian politician Mustafa Barghouti calls Biden's visit "catastrophic"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4)
*  MTS Tayyab spent time in Ramallah over the weekend, and he is back in West Jerusalem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, across the Middle East and around the world, we've seen massive demonstrations [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  in solidarity with Palestinians. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=10.58s)]
*  In London, over 100,000 people took to the streets of the British capital demanding an [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=12.9s)]
*  end to Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=18.28s)]
*  There's also been similar scenes in Arab capitals, from Sana'a in war-torn Yemen to Cairo, where [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=20.92s)]
*  the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, called for a quote, day of rage, just hours [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=26.68s)]
*  after his phone call with President Biden earlier this week. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=32.32s)]
*  It was a phone call in which a deal was reached between Egypt, the U.S., and Israel to allow [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=35.6s)]
*  20 trucks of desperately needed humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, which started arriving [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  only yesterday. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=47.84s)]
*  On the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the violence there is only getting worse. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=49.8s)]
*  We were at one protest where we witnessed Israeli snipers shoot at least three Palestinians. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=55.8s)]
*  Now, earlier, we spoke with Mustafa Barghouti, the president of the Palestinian National [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=61.08s)]
*  Initiative and a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council since 2006. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=65.8s)]
*  MUSTafa BARGHOUTI, Palestinian National Initiative Member I'm shattered. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=69.72s)]
*  I'm angry, mainly because I don't understand why this all should happen. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  But what breaks my heart so much is the suffering of civilians, whether Palestinian or Israeli. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=79.4s)]
*  And what I don't understand is why the president of the United States comes here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=86.72s)]
*  And instead of telling Israel, enough is enough, you wanted to respond, you responded, you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=91.36s)]
*  already killed 4,000 Palestinians, stop. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=95.68s)]
*  Instead of that, he's encouraging them to have an invasion, a ground invasion. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  So you think President Biden's visit was a catastrophic mistake? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  MUSTafa BARGHOUTI, Palestinian National Initiative Member Catastrophic from three aspects. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=107.04s)]
*  First, it was a huge political and diplomatic failure, as I told you, because nobody wanted [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  to meet with him except Israelis. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=116.72s)]
*  Second, it's a strategic mistake because he's dragging the United States into a very dangerous [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=119.08s)]
*  area where war crimes are committed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=125.6s)]
*  And third, because he is consolidating the absence of peace process. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=129.0s)]
*  Do you see a scenario where this ends? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=133.84s)]
*  Yes, one scenario. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=136.72s)]
*  There is no other scenario. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=138.72s)]
*  Immediate change of the behavior of Western leaders who are now participating in encouraging [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=140.88s)]
*  Netanyahu to commit these war crimes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=146.2s)]
*  And the United States is the only country that has the real leverage over Israel. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=149.36s)]
*  And they should tell Israel, stop. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=155.0s)]
*  Stop, enough. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=157.64s)]
*  Let's have ceasefire. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=159.56s)]
*  Let's have immediate exchange of prisoners so that all Israeli prisoners would come back [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=161.2s)]
*  home safe. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=165.76s)]
*  And let's initiate a true peace process to solve the roots of the problem, which is occupation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=168.2s)]
*  and the system of apartheid. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  Now, efforts to create a Palestinian state have been at a standstill for years now, largely [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=175.92s)]
*  because Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's successive hard-right governments have been [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  firmly opposed to it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  And while the Biden administration continues to back calls for a peace process that would [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=188.2s)]
*  to a two-state solution, it's done very little practically and diplomatically to advance [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  that goal. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=199.24s)]
*  And after Hamas' brutal attack and a looming Israeli ground war in Gaza, it's a goal that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=200.4s)]
*  seems even further away than ever. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msqAKZ8Y7h4&t=205.96s)]
