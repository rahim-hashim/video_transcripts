# Why Biden wants to raise tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg)
*  President Biden is taking his message of economic competition to the heart of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=0.0s)]
*  American steel industry in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. In front of an [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=4.16s)]
*  audience of union steelworkers, he said he'll urge the U.S. trade representative to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=8.24s)]
*  consider tripling tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum. Those tariffs were initially [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=12.4s)]
*  imposed by former President Trump when he was in the White House. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=17.32s)]
*  Senior adviser to the president, Gene Sperling, joins us now. Gene, always good to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=21.0s)]
*  have a conversation with you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=25.12s)]
*  Tell us, Gene, about this decision to focus now on trade and tariffs. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=27.52s)]
*  Well, what the president's focus has been from day one is an American manufacturing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=32.52s)]
*  renaissance. And you've seen that through not just the infrastructure bill but the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  incentives to build in America, make it in America. And that's why we have nearly [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=42.96s)]
*  800,000 new manufacturing jobs and nearly double the investment in new factories. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=48.8s)]
*  Part, we've got to make sure we continue that manufacturing renaissance with new [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=56.12s)]
*  jobs. Now, the one thing that could hurt is if China were to essentially cheat in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=63.6s)]
*  trying to raise their growth through exporting at artificially low prices at [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  the expense of American workers. We've seen this in the past. We've had a strong [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=77.32s)]
*  record so far. The trade deficit, the goods trade deficit with China is down over 20%. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  It's lower than any year in the previous administration. But there is a fear. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=89.0s)]
*  You've heard it from Janet Yellen. You hear it from many, Secretary Janet Yellen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  Hear it from many people. China is trying to purposely create overcapacity, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=97.36s)]
*  over-subsidization to lower prices. They think that even though those might be [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=102.72s)]
*  being sold at a loss, they may think it's good for their economy. But it's only good [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=107.88s)]
*  by exporting at the expense of American workers. If they want to do that with fair [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=112.92s)]
*  competition, bring it on. That's how the president feels. But he's sending a very [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=118.52s)]
*  strong message today in steel, aluminum, and shipbuilding that you can't cheat your [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  way in exports and you can't do it at the expense of American workers. And [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=128.6s)]
*  Pennsylvania is a place that's been hurt by unfair trade for the last few decades, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  and he's making clear not on his watch. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  COSTA. Gene, let's step back for a moment here. You have been a veteran of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=142.0s)]
*  Democratic politics, an adviser to American presidents across the board on serious [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  economic issues. For many years in the Democratic Party there was an almost aversion to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=152.16s)]
*  tariffs as part of the arsenal when it came to an economic clash with China as China [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=158.32s)]
*  grew its economy in the 90s and early 2000s. For tariffs to be revived, are we seeing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=164.0s)]
*  almost a return to form for Democrats when it comes to economic policy and trade? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=169.68s)]
*  Is this a shift back or is it a shift forward? How do you see it as someone in the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=175.04s)]
*  trenches of these issues? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=180.16s)]
*  It's neither. It is dealing with economic reality. You know, you will not see this [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  administration just for across-the-board tariffs that do no good for jobs and would [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=189.44s)]
*  just raise costs on American families on things they need. But when it comes to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=195.04s)]
*  manufacturing, yes, this president is taking an aggressive stance. He believes and has [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=201.76s)]
*  shown that we can make it in America. You've seen just hundreds of billions of new [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=208.48s)]
*  investments, companies that are now making their manufacturing future in America from [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=214.72s)]
*  steel to semiconductors to new types of autos that are more energy efficient. That is [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=219.92s)]
*  very important to this agenda. That is important to the presidency of manufacturing, to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=229.2s)]
*  strong union jobs. And we are looking at reality right now. And what we're seeing is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  dramatic oversubsidization in China, overcapacity. And that's what a country might do [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=240.16s)]
*  when they're saying, hey, we would like to sell more goods, even if our companies are [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=246.72s)]
*  essentially selling them at a loss. We think it will be good for our economy. So we'll [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  subsidize them so they can sell them even if they couldn't make a profit on it. That is [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=257.12s)]
*  not an acceptable strategy when it is essentially an unfair trade practice in which they're [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=261.76s)]
*  trying to grow at the expense of putting American manufacturers and American workers out of the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=268.48s)]
*  job. So, you know, I don't think you take these jobs or presidents come in and say, here's like [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=274.08s)]
*  an overall approach that we're going to take, regardless of what the facts are. The president [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=280.0s)]
*  is dealing with the current situation in China with oversubsidization, trying to ensure his [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  manufacturing agenda, his Made in America manufacturing agenda grows and is not set back [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=292.4s)]
*  due to unfair trade practices. So he's just dealing with the economic realities in the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  economy right now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=303.52s)]
*  COSTA And just quickly, Gene, finally, you're being aggressive with this administration [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=305.52s)]
*  and taking on China now with this, with tariffs. How is China going to respond? What's your [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  real expectation of how the Chinese will handle this? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=315.84s)]
*  GENERAL MANNES I think, you know, the president will be the first to say our goal is not a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=320.32s)]
*  trade war. That's not our goal. That's not what we want. Our goal is honest, fair competition. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=326.08s)]
*  When that happens, economies tend to, you know, each company, each country has to be [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=333.44s)]
*  more on their game. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=340.08s)]
*  They'll do more to innovate. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=341.2s)]
*  So the president is not against fair competition. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=342.96s)]
*  We believe that American, that here in America, we are the most innovative, most competitive, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=346.72s)]
*  have the best workers, the best union manufacturing workers. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=351.6s)]
*  So it's not to, you know, have a trade war, but it is sending a real economic reality [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=356.18s)]
*  to them, an aluminum and steel and shipbuilding. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=363.72s)]
*  And I think it's also sending a very strong overall message that this president is not [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=366.82s)]
*  going to sit back if other countries are seeking to play unfair at the expense of an American [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=372.98s)]
*  manufacturing renaissance that is already underway. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=379.98s)]
*  You say a strong message, not a trade war. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=384.42s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=386.26s)]
*  Gene Sperling, we appreciate you taking the time and sharing your insights. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=387.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=390.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=391.14s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7KoW_zpPLg&t=392.14s)]
