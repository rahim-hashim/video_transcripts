# Michael McCaul, House Foreign Affairs chairman, says Chinese spy balloon had American-made parts
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg)
*  We go now to Congressman Michael McCaul. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=0.0s)]
*  He is the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=2.34s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=4.76s)]
*  Morning, Margaret. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=5.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=6.76s)]
*  I want to start on this unusual activity. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=7.76s)]
*  Three takedowns in eight days in the case of the spy balloon. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=10.96s)]
*  This was Chinese surveillance, according to the administration. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  On Friday, they put restrictions on six Chinese companies that allegedly helped China's military [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=19.48s)]
*  build that balloon. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  Is this the right move to just try to make it harder for them to get U.S. technology? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=28.64s)]
*  Or does Congress need to do something that's more broad? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=33.52s)]
*  Well, it's certainly the right move. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=36.24s)]
*  It will be one of my number one priorities as the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=38.56s)]
*  in this Congress to stop the export of technology to China that then goes into their most advanced [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=43.58s)]
*  weapons systems. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=50.38s)]
*  In this case, a sophisticated spy balloon that went across three nuclear sites. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  I think it's important to say in plain view, the American people. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=57.4s)]
*  You know, in Montana, the triad site, Air, Land and Sea nuclear weapons in Omaha, the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=61.0s)]
*  spy balloon went over our strategic command, which is our most sensitive nuclear site. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=67.2s)]
*  It was so sensitive that President Bush was taken there after 9-11. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=73.4s)]
*  And then finally, Missouri, the B-2 bomber, that's where they are placed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=77.6s)]
*  It did a lot of damage. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=84.0s)]
*  Is that what U.S. intelligence told you? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=85.08s)]
*  They've been saying they mitigated the impact. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=87.92s)]
*  They say they mitigated it, but my assessment, and I can't get into the detail of the intelligence [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=90.16s)]
*  document, is that if it's still transmitting, going over these three very sensitive nuclear [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  sites, I think if you look at the flight pattern of the balloon, it tells a story as to what [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=101.92s)]
*  the Chinese were up to as they controlled this aircraft throughout the United States. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=108.44s)]
*  Going over those sites, in my judgment, would cause great damage. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=113.68s)]
*  Remember, a balloon can see a lot more on the ground than a satellite. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=116.56s)]
*  So you said you want to try to stop the export of technology that can be used by China's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=120.76s)]
*  military. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  As a conservative, though, how much—this has to make you a little uncomfortable to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  have government try to control private business investment. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=130.44s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, we have what's called an entities list, a Department of Commerce, I have jurisdiction [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  over the office within there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=141.36s)]
*  The Department of Defense has one. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=143.84s)]
*  We need to harmonize those, make it more security-focused. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=146.28s)]
*  Capital flows is one issue, but technology exports into China that they use to turn—that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=150.12s)]
*  maybe eventually turn against us, we have to stop doing that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  And I think we can do it by sectors. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  They do it by companies now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=162.56s)]
*  Obviously, they identified the six. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=164.44000000000003s)]
*  I think shockingly, when the balloon was recovered, it had American-made component parts in there [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=166.64s)]
*  with English on that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=172.92s)]
*  It was made—parts made in America that were put on a spy balloon from China. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  I don't think the American people accept that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  Do you believe that this was a strategic choice by Xi Jinping's government in Beijing, or [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=182.32s)]
*  do you believe that it was just the left and right hand not knowing what was going on? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=187.64s)]
*  When I saw the sites that it was flying over, it was very clear to me this was an intentional [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=191.27999999999997s)]
*  act. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=196.12s)]
*  It was done with provocation to gather intelligence data and collect intelligence on our three [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=197.12s)]
*  major nuclear sites in this country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=204.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=207.16s)]
*  Because they're looking at what is our capability in the event of a possible future conflict [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=208.16s)]
*  in Taiwan. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=213.68s)]
*  They're really assessing what we have in this country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=214.68s)]
*  I find it extraordinary the timing of this flight as well, you know, right before the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=218.44s)]
*  State of the Union speech and also, you know, right before Secretary Blinken was scheduled [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=224.2s)]
*  to meet with Chairman Xi. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=229.52s)]
*  I think it was very much an act of belligerence on their part, and perhaps they don't care [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=230.52s)]
*  what the American people think about that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=235.84s)]
*  Before I let you go, I want to ask you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=238.44s)]
*  You voted in the last Congress to provide a lot of assistance to Ukraine, but this past [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=240.48s)]
*  week at least 10 of your members, Republican members, introduced a bill called the Ukraine [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=244.76s)]
*  Fatigue Resolution to try to cut off aid. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=250.04s)]
*  How hard is it going to be to have a Republican-led House continue to help Ukraine? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=253.12s)]
*  I still believe, Margaret, there are many on both sides of the aisle, majority of the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=258.56s)]
*  majorities in support of this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=263.04s)]
*  We have we have factions on the left and right that do not support Ukraine. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=265.04s)]
*  This is a Republican bill. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=270.08s)]
*  That will probably continue. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=271.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=272.08s)]
*  And I do think for me, particularly, it's we have to educate where has the money gone? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=273.08s)]
*  The audits that are in place right now, there are four of them on Ukraine funding, and we [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  have to explain why is Ukraine so important? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=287.6s)]
*  What happens in Ukraine impacts Taiwan and Chairman Xi. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=291.48s)]
*  The China's aligned with Russia, Iran and North Korea against freedom, democracy and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=294.76000000000005s)]
*  the West. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  I think that's a debate we'll have, but I still feel very confident that we will give [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=302.24s)]
*  them the assistance they need. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=306.92s)]
*  I'd like to see it faster so they can win this faster. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=308.52000000000004s)]
*  So you think Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, others who signed this need to be educated? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=311.76s)]
*  You know, look, we took Marjorie Taylor Greene into a briefing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  She was satisfied, I thought, with what the controls have been put in place on the spending. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=322.76s)]
*  But I don't think that they will ever be persuaded that this cause is something that they would [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=328.44s)]
*  support. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=335.32s)]
*  We have this false dichotomy that somehow we can't help Ukraine beat back the Russians [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=336.32s)]
*  who invaded their country and secure the border. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=343.36s)]
*  We can do both. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  We're a great nation. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is, unfortunately, this administration has chosen not to secure [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  the border. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=354.08s)]
*  He can't even control and secure our airspace now, it looks like. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=355.08s)]
*  Congressman McCaul, thank you for your time today. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=359.28s)]
*  Thanks, Margaret. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=361.88s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GIA7IucBQg&t=362.88s)]
