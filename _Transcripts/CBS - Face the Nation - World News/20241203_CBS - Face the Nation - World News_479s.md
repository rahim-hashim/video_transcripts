# White House says U.S. "seriously concerned" after South Korean president declares martial law
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U)
*  We are now going to go to Angola to talk to Willie James Inman, who is in that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=0.0s)]
*  nation with the president right now, President Joe Biden. Willie, we [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=4.28s)]
*  understand the U. S. Has a response about the situation. The declaration of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=9.32s)]
*  martial law in South Korea. What is that? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  Hey there, Reid. We're just getting this in. But also note that President Biden [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=20.2s)]
*  was asked about the situation and he said, I'm just getting briefed in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=23.72s)]
*  response to reporters questions about the situation in South Korea. But we do [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=27.16s)]
*  have a statement from an N. S. C. Spokesperson. I'll just read that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  statement for our viewers. It says the administration is in contact with the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=34.96s)]
*  Republic of Korea government and is monitoring the situation closely as we [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  work to learn more. The U. S. Was not notified in advance of this [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=42.68s)]
*  announcement. We are seriously concerned by the developments we are seeing on [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=46.2s)]
*  the ground in the Republic of Korea. And also note that official said, as the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=50.96s)]
*  president said himself that he was being briefed on the situation. This, of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=56.12s)]
*  course, is a major concern for the United States, which is a major partner [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=60.36s)]
*  of South Korea, a key ally in that region. And also note there's a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  significant military presence in South Korea as well. So the United States, of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=69.44s)]
*  course, concerned about that growing situation and will be bringing you any [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=73.8s)]
*  further details we get as the president travels here and continues his trip in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=79.28s)]
*  And Willie, while we talk to you in Angola, we are looking at in a split [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  screen just a second ago, live pictures there on the ground in Seoul, South [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=88.64s)]
*  Korea. There they are again, and you can see police on the ground. A moment ago [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=93.28s)]
*  we saw military vehicles on what is otherwise a series of peaceful streets [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  there in South Korea. Unnerving, to say the least on the South Korean Peninsula. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  You know, Willie, we've heard in recent weeks many officials from the United [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=106.04s)]
*  States talking about the U. S. Continued commitment on the Korean Peninsula, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=109.88s)]
*  especially for South Korea, as it speaks to economic partnerships as well. Of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=114.16s)]
*  course, the history of military support there in South Korea is long and story [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=118.56s)]
*  between the United States and South Korea. Talk to us about the position, at [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  least from the White House regarding being behind South Korea from an [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=126.96s)]
*  economic standpoint. That was a big narrative during the recent Apex [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=130.44s)]
*  summit. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=133.8s)]
*  Yeah, certainly is. South Korea is a major trading partner. There are not [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=134.08s)]
*  only major appliances, TVs, everything you could think of, electronics, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=143.88000000000002s)]
*  everything you can really get your hand on that are exported to the United [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=148.12s)]
*  States that American consumers purchase vehicles, of course, as well with major [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=152.56s)]
*  manufacturers like Kia and Honda being based in that country. I will also note [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=157.8s)]
*  that South Korea isn't necessarily in the best neighborhood you have to the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=164.36s)]
*  north, of course, North Korea. And so the United States has maintained that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=169.84s)]
*  presence for decades and not only in South Korea, but also in Japan as well [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=174.4s)]
*  nearby. Now, Japan and Korea have a storied history. There have been tense [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=179.52s)]
*  moments, but the U.S. in recent years has been able to bring all three countries [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  to a trilateral meeting where you have a lot more cooperation happening between [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=189.76s)]
*  Japan and South Korea as well. So the United States closely involved a close [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=195.2s)]
*  and key ally and the president monitoring the situation just as we have [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  in an N.S.C. spokesperson saying that they weren't informed ahead of time, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=206.27999999999997s)]
*  which is perhaps quite surprising, but still nonetheless, this is a surprising [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=210.8s)]
*  situation. Seoul is a place, a really peaceful place. I've been there myself, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=215.92s)]
*  I read, and it's really interesting and quite shocking to see all of this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=219.28s)]
*  happen there on those streets. It absolutely is. I was there for the Winter [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=224.32s)]
*  Olympics not many years ago and the ties between the United States and South [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=229.16s)]
*  Korea, they are deep there. And so to see these streets filled with such [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=233.64s)]
*  uncertainty at this hour is definitely cause for concern. Willie, while we have [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=237.96s)]
*  you there in Angola, the president, President Joe Biden, also had a lot to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  say regarding the history of slavery. We want to play what the president had to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  say and then have a conversation with you on the other side of that. Let's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=251.56s)]
*  listen to that. Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I'm in the final weeks of my [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  presidency. You don't have to clap for that. You can if you want. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=259.68s)]
*  But I wanted to come to Angola. Although I've been chairman of the African [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=263.24s)]
*  American subcommittee for a long time, I had never made it to Angola. Although I [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=268.12s)]
*  don't know exactly what the future will hold, I know the future runs through [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=272.16s)]
*  Angola, through Africa. I mean it sincerely. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm not kidding. I know that any nation that wants to thrive in the next century [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=280.68s)]
*  must work as partners with workers, entrepreneurs and businesses here in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=285.08s)]
*  Africa. I know that the connection between our communities, our universities, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=290.48s)]
*  our sports, our civil societies, our families, our people will only grow [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=295.12s)]
*  deeper. We have to stay focused. The story of Angola in the United States [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=299.68s)]
*  holds a lesson for the world. Two nations with a shared history and evil of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=304.72s)]
*  human bondage, two nations on opposite sides of the Cold War, defining struggle [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=309.8s)]
*  in the late part of the 20th century. And now two nations standing shoulder [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=315.44s)]
*  to shoulder, working together every day for the mutual benefit of our people. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=319.76s)]
*  All right. So President Joe Biden there in Angola, wrapping up what will likely [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=325.76s)]
*  be his last official visit as the president of the United States on an [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=329.4s)]
*  international level, you know, talking about slavery there, but also driving [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  the conversation forward. Willie, are you seeing an emerging conversation [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=337.56s)]
*  in the world as it relates to Africa, the entire continent and the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=340.8s)]
*  possibilities for economic partnerships that we haven't seen in recent [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=345.4s)]
*  decades? Well, at least for the United States, because experts will point out [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=349.64s)]
*  that the U.S. is late to the game, that you've had players like China and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=359.0s)]
*  Russia already with deep roots, deep economic ties, deep infrastructure [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  projects here within Africa on the continent after things like critical [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=368.56s)]
*  minerals. This is part of why the president is here. He's here to talk [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=373.68s)]
*  about what's known as the Lobito corridor. That is a rail connection that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=377.8s)]
*  will connect a major port on the west coast of Angola to the rest of the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  world, to the United States. It's going to bring those critical mineral [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=387.68s)]
*  deposits from the Democratic Republic of Congo to the coastline to be exported [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  to the United States. Those minerals are used for things such as EV, vehicle [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=396.2s)]
*  batteries, also used for cell phones, everything you can think of. The future [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=400.8s)]
*  of green energy really runs through the African continent and the United States [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  knows that. And that's why you're seeing this major project, some billions, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=411.88s)]
*  three billion worth contributed by the United States for this railroad [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  project. I'll note that China, as I mentioned, has the upper hand here and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  the U.S., although they might not necessarily say that. We talked to John [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=425.52s)]
*  Kirby earlier today and he said this isn't about the U.S. pushing back [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=428.6s)]
*  against one nation. But the writing is on the wall read with China and Russia [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  as major players on the African continent and the president perhaps [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=438.8s)]
*  looking to not only solidify his legacy, but boost this partnership with Angola, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=442.24s)]
*  with other nations. He's actually going to visit the town of the town of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=448.32000000000005s)]
*  Lobito tomorrow to visit this port and get a look at it for himself to see [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  where all of those U.S. dollars are going and what it means for the U.S. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  economy and the world as a whole. We appreciate the conversation. We know [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=462.04s)]
*  you're traveling with the president. We also know because of the time [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=466.44s)]
*  difference, Willie, that you work very long days in order to be on CBS News [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=468.76000000000005s)]
*  24 seven and our other CBS broadcast. You have you have our gratitude. We [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=473.36s)]
*  thank you so much. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaJ1sBQ3p9U&t=477.64000000000004s)]
