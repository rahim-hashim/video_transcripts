# Former U.S. ambassador to Russia reacts to multi-nation prisoner swap
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ)
*  Welcome back. We continue to follow breaking news. CBS News is learning that Paul Whelan, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=0.0s)]
*  an American who has been in prison in Russia for nearly six years and Wall Street Journal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=6.2s)]
*  reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was just sentenced by Russia to 16 years in a maximum security [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=10.88s)]
*  prison, are both part of a prisoner swap. Gershkovich, the journal and the State Department [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=16.4s)]
*  have consistently said the charges are false. The United States says Whelan was also wrongfully [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=22.2s)]
*  For more on this, I'm joined by John Sullivan. He was U.S. Ambassador to Russia from 2020 [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=28.8s)]
*  to 2022 and is now a CBS News contributor. Ambassador, thanks for being with us. What [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  is your reaction? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  Well, first, I'm delighted for the Americans who have been released and their families. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  I was in my office at the State Department almost six years ago when Paul was set up [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=47.0s)]
*  by the FSB and arrested. I've been thinking about Paul working on his case, talking to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=51.92s)]
*  his family for a long time, and I know that his brothers, his sister, his parents are [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=57.36s)]
*  going to be overjoyed. Evan was arrested after I had left Moscow as ambassador, but I know [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=62.84s)]
*  that his family will feel the same way and the other American who has been released, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  Aslu, her family will be overjoyed. I've spoken to all of them since I've left Moscow. So [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=75.64s)]
*  I have a feeling of elation for those Americans who have been released and their families, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=82.96s)]
*  but I also know that there is a price that the United States and some of our allies, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=87.8s)]
*  apparently Germany, have paid in releasing Russian dangerous criminals to get innocent [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=92.08s)]
*  Americans back home. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=98.12s)]
*  You know, you were mentioning Paul Whelan, and we heard from him last December, his fifth [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=99.68s)]
*  Christmas behind bars, and he was saying that he felt left behind because he was not included [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=105.76s)]
*  in the prisoner swap that included basketball star Brittany Greiner. What do you know about [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=111.56s)]
*  why he wasn't included in previous prisoner swaps? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=115.96s)]
*  Well, from my conversations with the Russians, and I was engaged in a lot of negotiations [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  with the Russians over Paul, some of it was about his release, other negotiations were [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  just about how badly he was being treated and to have that stop, but what the Russians [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=129.48s)]
*  would point to was the fact that they would characterize him as an American spy. They [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=134.2s)]
*  would say he's been convicted of espionage and we don't trade spies for just any ordinary [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=139.24s)]
*  criminal. We want a like for like exchange. And they thought at that time that there wasn't [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  someone in U.S. custody who would be an equivalent to be traded for Paul. We in the United States [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  knew of course that was completely bogus, that Paul was set up, he's not an American [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=159.4s)]
*  spy, he doesn't work for U.S. intelligence agencies, but that was the Russian position. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=163.36s)]
*  What can you tell us about the Russian judicial system and how these trials went? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=169.2s)]
*  So I was an observer of Trevor Reed's trial, who is an American who was wrongfully detained, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  who was released while I was ambassador in 2022. I was frequently in the courtroom during [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=181.56s)]
*  his court proceedings. I was not allowed into Paul's trial because it was a secret trial [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  with secret evidence that some of which even Paul didn't get to see. So the way I'd characterize [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=192.56s)]
*  the Russian judicial system is it's to borrow a Russian cultural reference. It's a Potemkin [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  judicial system. It's fake. It's phony. The courtrooms are beautiful. The judges wear [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=204.4s)]
*  beautiful robes with a gold chain that senses the robe at the top, but it is completely [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=209.96s)]
*  a non-adversarial system. It's merely a means for the Russian government to justify what [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  it's doing to an American who's been charged, in Paul's case, with espionage. It's not [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  what an American lawyer, which I am, would think of as a court. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=232.28s)]
*  Appreciate you, Ambassador. Thank you for being with us. Let's bring back CBS News [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=238.48s)]
*  senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer. Liz, it's important to note, as important [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  as this prisoner swap is and significant, there are still many Americans who have not [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=247.92s)]
*  been released and are not part of this deal. That's right. I've just counted them up. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=254.16s)]
*  There are seven Americans that remain in U.S. custody. And the distinction that the ambassador [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=259.96s)]
*  made there is crucial. So the majority of them are in jail for crimes, nothing to do [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=266.96s)]
*  with the security establishment. And as far as we can tell, not trumped up charges either, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=274.4s)]
*  although the details aren't clear in every case. But for example, two of them were arrested [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=279.8s)]
*  on drugs charges, possession. One man is involved in a child custody dispute with a Russian [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=287.32s)]
*  wife. One has been arrested for theft and beating up his girlfriend. And one for being [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  completely blind drunk on a train and attacking a policeman. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=301.84s)]
*  The one exception is Ksenia Karolina from L.A. She was picked up in Russia this spring [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=308.84s)]
*  and has been charged with treason, which carries a sentence of 20 years, allegedly for having [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=318.35999999999996s)]
*  given money that reached Ukrainian military. It's not clear what's going to happen when [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=323.32s)]
*  her. But we knew for sure she wasn't included in this prisoner exchange and that will have [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=331.96s)]
*  been devastating for her family. Liz, we have been talking a little bit about [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  Gershkovich and Whalen. There are two other people as part of this. There's also Kermashev. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=343.56s)]
*  She's a U.S. dual nationalist. There's also Vladimir Karamurza. He's a prisoner held in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=348.88s)]
*  Russia. What can you tell us about these two? He is a very brave guy. He is a human rights [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  activist and sometimes politician. He ran to be a parliamentarian in Russia. But he [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=361.16s)]
*  was a strong opposition of President Putin. He also worked for one of the leading exiled [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=368.16s)]
*  opposition figures, the former chess champion. I'm blanking. It'll come to me in a second. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=375.88s)]
*  Anyway, he, Khodorkovsky. And so as such, he really identified himself, made himself [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=382.88s)]
*  very prominent as an opponent of the Russian government. And he was arrested, charged with [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=392.36s)]
*  treason and has been in jail ever since. He, although he's a British citizen, Cambridge [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=398.78s)]
*  educated, he has really strong ties to the United States. He worked on human rights cases [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=405.4s)]
*  with Senator, the late Senator McCain. And Senator McCain emailed him shortly before [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=411.6s)]
*  his death and asked him if he would be one of the pallbearers at the senator's funeral. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=416.44s)]
*  He also continued to write very critical political commentary from inside jail and won the Pulitzer [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=422.68s)]
*  Prize from, for commentary for those writings. It will be inexpressibly wonderful for his [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=429.18s)]
*  family to know he's getting out because he believes he was poisoned twice by the Russian [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=436.18s)]
*  security services. His health has been fragile and he hasn't been getting the care in jail [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=441.94s)]
*  that he has needed. So now he'll be back in safe hands. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nht0-FbT3GQ&t=447.42s)]
