# Analyzing France’s political situation after prime minister’s resignation
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE)
*  Okay, well French President Emmanuel Macron is accusing his political opponents of creating [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=0.0s)]
*  chaos after left and right wing lawmakers voted to oust his prime minister just three [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=4.78s)]
*  months into the job. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=9.56s)]
*  In a public address Thursday, Macron said he will appoint a new prime minister in the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=11.08s)]
*  coming days, one that he says will reach consensus in a bitterly divided parliament. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  Currently no political party holds an absolute majority in France's legislature. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=20.66s)]
*  In his address, Macron said, quote, I will never take the blame for the lack of responsibility [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=24.88s)]
*  of others. We can't allow ourselves to be divided or to do nothing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=29.56s)]
*  Angela Charlton joins us now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=34.36s)]
*  She's the Western Europe news director for the Associated Press. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=36.0s)]
*  Angela, great to have you on the program today. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=39.56s)]
*  I want to level set for a moment. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=42.8s)]
*  I think it would be helpful for some context for our viewers. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=44.56s)]
*  Just how bad are the political divisions in France right now? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=47.84s)]
*  Has the country been in this situation before? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=51.8s)]
*  No, in fact, this is unprecedented for France. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=55.72s)]
*  We are in a situation with a hung parliament. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=59.0s)]
*  We've got three political factions that are roughly equally balanced and they absolutely [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  do not get along and can't agree on anything. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  This is the far right of Marine Le Pen, the left wing parties and Macron's centrist [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=69.28s)]
*  center right camp. And this has been the case since elections in July. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=75.56s)]
*  And this parliament has been able to do almost nothing so far except bring down the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=80.32s)]
*  government this week. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, in the U.S., we are we are no strangers to sides not getting along. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=86.8s)]
*  So I hear you on that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=91.0s)]
*  I'm curious. I mean, Macron says he will not step down. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  So in your perspective, how much of the political turmoil you're seeing is a result of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=96.56s)]
*  his actions? Well, Macron himself acknowledged in his address to the nation tonight [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=101.32s)]
*  his own share of responsibility and what's happened now by calling those snap elections [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=107.36s)]
*  in the summer that left this hung parliament and in fact made things worse for him and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=111.48s)]
*  for France than they were before. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  So he's aware of that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=118.92s)]
*  But he also stood his ground, was very firm saying he is going to stick it out to the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=120.76s)]
*  rest of his term. It's another two and a half years before his term is up. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=124.76s)]
*  And so, of course, the next prime minister is going to have a lot to handle once this [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=129.44s)]
*  person's named, including a budget issue that partially drove that vote of no [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=134.44s)]
*  confidence. So what do you think are some of the immediate challenge that this person [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=139.6s)]
*  would have to deal with? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's kind of everything. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=146.0s)]
*  But as you say, the budget was key. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=147.92s)]
*  That's the reason that the government fell, is that the parties couldn't agree on a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=149.88s)]
*  budget for 2025. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  So here we are a few weeks away from the new year with no budget. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=155.68s)]
*  So that's going to be number one priority. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=159.68s)]
*  Macron did say tonight that he would try to push through a bill in Parliament as soon [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  as possible that would allow just an automatic levying of taxes and things starting on [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  January 1st so that basic services could continue. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  And France does have a slightly different structure from the U.S. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  So you wouldn't have a full U.S. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=177.64s)]
*  style shut down January 1st, but it's still a problem for many sectors. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=179.04s)]
*  And it's something that's worrying financial markets as well. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=183.48s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, investors don't like uncertainty. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=186.32s)]
*  I don't care what market they're playing in. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=190.28s)]
*  Let's kind of shift gears, though. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=192.76s)]
*  I mean, Saturday, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=194.08s)]
*  It's meant to be such a big day for France. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=195.24s)]
*  It's the reopening of Notre Dame after that devastating fire. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump is set to be there along with other world leaders. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  Do you think this political uncertainty is overshadowing all of that? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=206.36s)]
*  Well, it is bad timing for Macron. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  He's got this big show he's been planning for five years, basically, that's starting on [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  Saturday, including all kinds of visitors, as you say, including Donald Trump. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=219.12s)]
*  And now he's got no government. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=224.32s)]
*  Everything's in turmoil. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=226.52s)]
*  It does remind us a bit of the situation right before the Paris Olympics. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=228.08s)]
*  That's when we had these snap elections and things were up in the air and things were very stressful. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=231.72s)]
*  But I think that based on what we saw in the summer during the Olympics, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=236.24s)]
*  Macron will probably try to do the same thing and just turn all of his energy [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=240.6s)]
*  toward the cathedral, toward the reopening. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=243.88s)]
*  He will not make any reference to the political situation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=246.12s)]
*  And he'll just try to rise above it and make this weekend all about the heritage of humanity, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=249.12s)]
*  this magnificent cathedral rising from the ashes for the world to enjoy and really distance [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=254.72s)]
*  himself from the politics at home. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=259.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it is set to be a momentous occasion. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=261.32s)]
*  So I guess the political problems can wait for Monday. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=264.2s)]
*  Angela Charlton, really appreciate you joining us tonight. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=268.08s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T1ViXLI-TE&t=270.12s)]
