# Russia holds staged referendums in disputed Ukrainian territories
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U)
*  But we begin with Ukraine, our Deborah Pata has the latest from Kiev. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=0.0s)]
*  Staged polls in occupied cities like these, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=5.68s)]
*  referendums amid the rubble and ruin of war. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=8.76s)]
*  A grotesque mockery of democracy, ballots propped up by bullets. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Election officials accompanied by armed soldiers go traipsing up flights of stairs, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=17.36s)]
*  knocking on doors searching for voters. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Others pound the streets with loudhalers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=26.8s)]
*  Russian news outlets were keen to show enthusiastic voters in occupied Kherson. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=31.0s)]
*  A day later, that same location was deserted. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=36.36s)]
*  Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of now occupied Militopol calls it a farce. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=39.64s)]
*  I think that we can name Russian it's a terrorist, which hold our citizens as hostage. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=45.24s)]
*  Russians take a hostage our citizens now inside the Militopol. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=51.0s)]
*  The White House regards the referendums as a sign of Vladimir Putin's weakness, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=55.84s)]
*  following crushing battlefield defeats. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  But Putin's not only a sore loser, he's a dangerous one. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=64.4s)]
*  Threatening nuclear weapons and imposing an immediate call up for military reservists. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=69.52s)]
*  It sparked widespread anti-war protests at home, resulting in hundreds of arrests [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=75.28s)]
*  and the panicked exodus of young men fleeing the country to dodge the draft, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=81.52s)]
*  like Sergey caught up in a long line of traffic at the Finnish border. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=86.64s)]
*  I just packed my bag and directly go to Finland. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=91.2s)]
*  Many of those called up have never fought in a war, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=97.64s)]
*  let alone one that already has hardened Russian fighters on the run. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=101.2s)]
*  Nobody is waiting with bated breath here in Ukraine for the results of those elections. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=106.68s)]
*  It is clear Putin wants to push through a vote to annex the territories quickly [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  and that could happen as early as this week, Margaret. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  Our Deborah Pata reporting from Ukraine. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AMCiq1c-6U&t=121.96000000000001s)]
