# NATO calls emergency meeting with Ukraine after Russian missile strike
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM)
*  NATO held emergency talks with Ukraine Tuesday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=0.0s)]
*  The meeting was called after Russia hit the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro last week [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=4.16s)]
*  with an experimental ballistic missile. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=9.08s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed Western anti-missile systems are incapable of intercepting [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=11.36s)]
*  this new type of weapon. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=16.56s)]
*  A NATO spokesperson says the military alliance reaffirmed its support for Ukraine during [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=18.2s)]
*  the talks and that the Dnipro strike would not alter the course of the war. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=23.16s)]
*  At a separate meeting with the Prime Minister of Greece, NATO's Secretary General said [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=27.48s)]
*  more should be done to aid Ukraine. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=31.04s)]
*  Our support for Ukraine has kept them in the fight. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=33.08s)]
*  But we need to go further to change the trajectory of the conflict. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=37.8s)]
*  We need to provide critical air defenses and deliver on the commitments made at the NATO [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=42.72s)]
*  summit in Washington. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=48.68s)]
*  Ivo Dalder joins us now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  He is the former US ambassador to NATO. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=51.88s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=54.28s)]
*  What options does NATO have to respond to Russia without escalating the conflict? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=56.36s)]
*  Well, it has the most important option to continue to do what it's doing, which is to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=60.92s)]
*  send as many weapons as it can, as quickly as it can to Ukraine and to support Ukraine, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=67.28s)]
*  not just this month, not just next month, but really for as long as it takes for Ukraine [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=74.44s)]
*  to be able to defend the territory that the Russians are attacking. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=80.08s)]
*  I'm not particularly worried about the prospect of real escalation because of what the Russians [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=84.68s)]
*  have been doing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=90.56s)]
*  The Russians are trying to rattle our cages. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  And this is a time when, as I think NATO said today at the meeting, it's time to bear downs, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=94.48s)]
*  be steadfast and continue to support Ukraine. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=101.64000000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about the rattling of the cage, because NATO says Russia using this new type [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  of missile won't change the course of the conflict. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=108.7s)]
*  But according to Putin, these missiles fly at 10 times the speed of sound. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=111.2s)]
*  How could that not change the conflict? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=114.6s)]
*  Well, one, they don't have a lot of them. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=116.08s)]
*  Two, they really only have an impact when they aren't by nuclear weapons, not by the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=119.24s)]
*  conventional weapons that this one missile seemed to have had. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=126.52s)]
*  And that would really change the nature of the conflict. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=131.24s)]
*  The use of a nuclear weapon has not happened since 1945. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  So before that happens, Vladimir Putin would have to think very seriously about the consequences. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=141.04s)]
*  But as a conventional missile, yes, it can do damage. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  But there were 180 or so drones being shot just overnight by the Russians against Ukraine, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=157.76s)]
*  25,000 missiles and drones since the beginning of the war. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=164.48s)]
*  One more missile that happens to go very fast is not going to make a fundamental difference. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=168.64s)]
*  Well, Trump says he would end the war in 24 hours. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=173.72s)]
*  He hasn't said how, but could these recent developments be an effort by either Ukraine [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=176.2s)]
*  or Russia to sort of maximize their bargaining positions before Trump comes into office? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=179.88s)]
*  Yeah, I do think that particularly on the Russian side, you're seeing an attempt to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  gain as much territory and they're actually are gaining quite a bit of territory compared [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=189.83999999999997s)]
*  to what was the case for the last few months. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=195.8s)]
*  But they're doing so at an incredible cost. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=199.4s)]
*  We now know it's about 1500 dead and wounded a day that the Russians are losing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  That's about 45,000 a month. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=207.8s)]
*  Those are extraordinary numbers of casualties. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=210.72s)]
*  Yes, the Ukrainians are also suffering casualties, but the square kilometers that the Russians [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  are gaining in territory, which looks like they are trying to gain before the inauguration [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  of President Trump, is coming at a cost that is really truly extraordinary. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=225.4s)]
*  If the U.S. stopped sending money to Ukraine under Trump, would NATO be forced to reevaluate [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=230.16s)]
*  its position on aid for Ukraine? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=234.28s)]
*  Well, the aid that is being provided today is provided by nations, not by NATO as such. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  So if the United States decided no longer to send aid, then European members of NATO [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  would have to consider whether they could fill the gap. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=249.32s)]
*  The answer to that is yes when it comes to monetary terms, but probably no when it comes [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=252.8s)]
*  to actual weapons. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=257.6s)]
*  There just aren't enough weapons that the Europeans have in their stockpiles that can [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=259.12s)]
*  be sent. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=263.32s)]
*  But what I think will happen is a continuing support for Ukraine, including for the Ukrainian [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  defense industry, with more and more money being transferred to the Ukrainians to increase [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=269.90000000000003s)]
*  its own capabilities. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=275.36s)]
*  That said, there's no doubt that if the United States cut off further aid to Ukraine, that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=277.04s)]
*  will have a major impact on Ukraine's ability to defend itself against this brutal attack. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=282.0s)]
*  Ambassador Ivo Dalder, we really appreciate your expertise. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=286.36s)]
*  We hope you'll come back. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=289.4s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYILmpOuFM&t=291.32s)]
