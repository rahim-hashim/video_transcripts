# Hamas to release more Israeli hostages, including four bodies
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw)
*  Hamas has revealed when it will release the remaining Israeli hostages from Gaza that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=0.0s)]
*  it agreed to hand over as part of the first phase of the ceasefire deal. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=5.0s)]
*  Mark Lohan with our partners at BBC has more from Jerusalem. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=9.52s)]
*  Well, Hamas have now confirmed that there will be four dead bodies of the hostages who [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  will be released on Thursday to Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=18.48s)]
*  Now, that is the first time that the dead Israeli hostages are being released to Israel [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=20.92s)]
*  since the ceasefire deal came into place. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=27.2s)]
*  And that will happen on Thursday. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  And then six living hostages are to be released on Saturday. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=32.0s)]
*  That is twice the number originally planned in the weekly releases. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=35.24s)]
*  And then a further four dead bodies will be handed over next week. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=39.04s)]
*  Now amongst the four dead hostages to be released this Thursday, Hamas says will be the Bebas [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=43.28s)]
*  family. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=48.8s)]
*  Shiri and Yarden Bebas were seized on the 7th of October in those attacks by Hamas, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=49.8s)]
*  along with their two sons. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=54.56s)]
*  Ariel, who was just four at the time, and Kfeir, who was just nine months. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=56.64s)]
*  They are the two youngest hostages. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=60.84s)]
*  And they have become very much the symbol across this country of the brutality of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=63.64s)]
*  7th of October attacks. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=68.28s)]
*  So if indeed they are confirmed by Israeli forensic teams on Thursday to be among those [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=70.08s)]
*  four bodies, it will be an extremely painful moment for Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  Now the release of the bodies and the release of the announced release of the living hostages [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=80.76s)]
*  on Saturday is a sign that the ceasefire deal is back on track and is progressing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  Israel has sent a negotiating team to Cairo and says it is ready to start meaningful negotiations [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=91.44000000000001s)]
*  with Hamas on progressing to the second phase of the ceasefire deal. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=98.44000000000001s)]
*  It is going to be a very contentious phase because it would envisage a full Israeli withdrawal [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=102.56s)]
*  from the Gaza Strip, which is bitterly opposed by the far right of Benjamin Netanyahu's government. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=107.12s)]
*  So it is not a given that it will be successful. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=113.04s)]
*  But at least it seems for now that the two sides are ready to negotiate on progressing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=116.04s)]
*  the ceasefire deal. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  Mark Lohan, thank you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  Egypt is developing a plan to rebuild Gaza without forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=123.76s)]
*  to leave the territory. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=128.44s)]
*  Egyptian state media reports the proposal calls for creating secure areas within Gaza [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  where Palestinians can live while reconstruction efforts are underway. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  News of the plan comes after President Trump called for the U.S. to take over Gaza and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  move the population to Egypt and Jordan. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  And while the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains fragile, the agreement with Iranian-backed [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=145.96s)]
*  Hezbollah is also on shaky ground. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=149.76s)]
*  Israel says its forces will remain in five strategic locations inside southern Lebanon. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  Both Israel and Hezbollah were supposed to fully withdraw from the area by Tuesday, at [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=158.44s)]
*  which point the Lebanese military would control the region. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=162.84s)]
*  Israel has not said how long it plans to stay there. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRoGDvApYFw&t=166.32s)]
