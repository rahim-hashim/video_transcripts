# Ambassador Oksana Markarova says Ukraine will be "responsible" in using U.S.-supplied weapons
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs)
*  We turn now to the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=0.0s)]
*  Great to have you back with us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=3.44s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=4.92s)]
*  Your president and our president said that Ukraine's running out of ammunition. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=6.48s)]
*  So how quickly will this latest U.S. package arrive and how quickly will it make a difference? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=10.64s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me say how grateful we are to President Biden and to everyone [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=17.2s)]
*  for making this decision to provide us with this munition. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=21.92s)]
*  I know everyone is discussing how difficult it was and sometimes even call it controversial. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=24.6s)]
*  But there is nothing controversial about it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=29.52s)]
*  We are fighting on our territory, brutal enemy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=31.68s)]
*  There is nothing worse than tortures, rapes and everything that Russians do on the territories [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=34.64s)]
*  they occupy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=40.96s)]
*  And we need to liberate as quick as possible. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=41.52s)]
*  So we're really grateful that in times when we do need increased numbers of munitions [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=43.64s)]
*  to support our counteroffensive, that U.S. made the decision. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=48.96s)]
*  And we really hope we will see it very quickly on the battlefield. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  So these cluster munitions drop bomblets and sometimes those bomblets don't explode right [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=56.08s)]
*  away and years later they can be a danger. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=63.16s)]
*  I've met victims who've been blinded and maimed in places where the U.S. dropped these [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=65.44s)]
*  decades ago. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=69.36s)]
*  So when the White House says that Ukraine has made assurances on how it will use these, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=70.76s)]
*  how do you do this and assure that civilians won't be hurt? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=76.56s)]
*  Well, first of all, let's remind where we started with. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=80.52s)]
*  Ukraine is the most mined country now already. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=83.04s)]
*  Russians mined everywhere. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=86.92s)]
*  The unexploded ordinance is everywhere. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=89.04s)]
*  So we're doing a lot of demining. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=91.2s)]
*  And U.S., by the way, is helping us a lot in demining already now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=92.88s)]
*  With regard to these munitions that we will be getting from the U.S., first, they are [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=97.56s)]
*  of a much higher quality. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=101.68s)]
*  So to start with. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=103.28s)]
*  And second, as responsible as we are with all other American supplied or European supplied [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=105.08s)]
*  munitions, we are controlling it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=111.52s)]
*  We have a very responsible ways. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=113.68s)]
*  We use the NATO type of lock fast system to record every unit that we have, where it is. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=116.64s)]
*  We will use the same type of approach to this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=123.12s)]
*  We will know where we use it, how we used it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=125.52s)]
*  And of course, you know, every time we liberate our territories, these deminers are the first [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=128.52s)]
*  people that go there, try to make sure that the area is safe. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=133.6s)]
*  So we will do exactly the same. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=138.14s)]
*  And I imagine Russia uses these on civilian areas. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  I have to imagine Ukraine has pledged not to do that and only to use them on soldiers. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=145.4s)]
*  Oh, my God, they use this and force for and everything else specifically on civilian areas [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=150.28s)]
*  and destroying civilian areas. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  We definitely we will not do we will not use it in civilian populated areas. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=158.44s)]
*  That's a war crime aspect that that Russia has been criticized for on this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=163.92s)]
*  You heard President Biden say Ukraine's not ready for NATO membership. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=168.32s)]
*  What did you think? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=172.48s)]
*  We are getting ready for NATO membership. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=174.92s)]
*  We know and we're doing very difficult reforms, even as we fight for it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=178.32s)]
*  What we are definitely ready for is for invitation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=182.48s)]
*  And I think, you know, with regard to the NATO membership, if you look at any any aspect [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  of it, Ukraine is very ready in a number of aspects. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  And if there is something that is left there, we can sure do it later on. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=197.32s)]
*  But we are discussing now about the invitation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=201.72s)]
*  You know, you know that in 2008, the open door policy towards Ukraine have been adopted. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=204.84s)]
*  We want not only the door to be open, we want to be invited to come in. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=211.24s)]
*  Well, the White House seemed to close the door on that part of the invitation, at least, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=215.52s)]
*  but eventually allow for Ukraine to join NATO. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=219.52s)]
*  That was that seemed to be the signal White House was sending on Friday. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=222.32s)]
*  The discussions are still ongoing and the discussion and of course, it's the discussion [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=226.04s)]
*  that requires 31 countries to agree. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=230.16s)]
*  And again, as you know, with like with the European Union membership, there is a path [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=233.16s)]
*  towards the European Union. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=240.96s)]
*  We are candidate country and we are working towards our full membership. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=242.52s)]
*  Similar approach we take with NATO. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=246.44s)]
*  We want to be in NATO. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=249.36s)]
*  The majority of Ukrainians support Ukraine in NATO. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=250.64s)]
*  This is in our constitution. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=253.96s)]
*  And we have done the majority of reforms already to be NATO eligible. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  We are ready to continue on that path. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=260.2s)]
*  And we would like to see that our friends in NATO are together with us on this path. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=261.92s)]
*  This week, the largest nuclear plant in Europe once again was very much in focus on the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=267.68s)]
*  front line of this conflict. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=273.6s)]
*  Your president says Ukraine has intelligence showing that Russia will try to blow it up, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=275.88s)]
*  that it has mined the area. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=281.24s)]
*  The UN watchdog says they've only been able to search parts of the area. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=283.12s)]
*  So far, it looks OK. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=287.48s)]
*  But there are two key reactors they want access to. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=289.32s)]
*  What is the level of risk right now? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=292.68s)]
*  The level of risk there is consistently high since March 4th, 2022, since Russians [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=295.48s)]
*  illegally occupied Ukrainian nuclear station. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=302.56s)]
*  So we just have to be very clear from the start every time we discuss the Parisian [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=305.84s)]
*  nuclear plant, the largest nuclear plant in Europe. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=309.44s)]
*  That the only source of risk there is Russia. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  You add to that Russia's absolutely irresponsible withdrawal or suspension of the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=316.92s)]
*  New START Treaty, their decision to deploy the tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  And it's clear that we are dealing with a nuclear terrorist. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=328.32000000000005s)]
*  Now, look at Chernobyl station, which they also grabbed since they invaded us in February [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=331.12s)]
*  22. As soon as Russians are out of there, there is no risk. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=335.56s)]
*  Similar here. We all have to work together to get them out. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=340.08000000000004s)]
*  Because again, let me remind you about the Khohavka Dam destruction, which Russians [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=343.92s)]
*  did, knowing how devastating it will be. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=348.48s)]
*  So the intent and there is no red lines for them there. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  We just have to stay focused and get them out from the station. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=355.6s)]
*  As soon as it's in Ukrainian hands fully again, there will be no risks. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=359.56s)]
*  Does Ukraine support what the UN is calling for, which is, you know, sort of a safe [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=364.68s)]
*  zone around it so that Ukraine isn't shelling in the area and neither is Russia? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=368.96s)]
*  Look, all Ukraine should be demilitarized from Russian military. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=373.28s)]
*  So we have to get them out from everywhere in Ukraine, not to allow them [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=377.23999999999995s)]
*  create some safe zones for them inside Ukraine. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=382.44s)]
*  We are very responsible, as you have seen during all this period, towards the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=385.67999999999995s)]
*  nuclear, the Parisian nuclear station. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  But the only answer to that problem is no Russians there. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=391.96s)]
*  It's Ukrainian territory, it's Ukrainian station, and there should not be [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=397.76s)]
*  occupiers, brutal occupiers there. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=401.8s)]
*  We will be watching what happens this week at NATO. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=404.56s)]
*  And so good to have you back with us, Ambassador. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0isSWC3Cs&t=406.96s)]
