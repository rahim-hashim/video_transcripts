*  This is Xi's final stop on a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  five-day European tour that also [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=22.92s)]

*  Isaac, thanks so much for being [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=37.46s)]
*  here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=39.06s)]
*  A lot to talk about, and I [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=40.06s)]
*  wonder if you could just start [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  off with sort of the basics [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  How closely is Hungary, how [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  closely are Hungary and China [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=47.160000000000004s)]
*  sort of tied together [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=48.660000000000004s)]
*  economically and culturally [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=50.34s)]
*  even? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=52.540000000000006s)]
*  Culturally, very little. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=53.540000000000006s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=54.540000000000006s)]
*  Economically and politically, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=55.540000000000006s)]
*  fairly close because both take [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=57.099999999999994s)]
*  a lot of pleasure and political [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  advantage in being against [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=62.04s)]
*  mainstream Europe and mainstream [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  American views. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=65.64s)]
*  Both are broadly supportive of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Putin's invasion of Ukraine and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=68.78s)]
*  both like a world order not led [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=70.98s)]
*  by the United States. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=73.52s)]
*  So it's a mutually beneficial [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=74.52s)]
*  relationship on that front [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=75.82s)]
*  geopolitically. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=77.36s)]
*  So how did Xi work to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=78.36s)]
*  strengthen China's influence in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=79.92s)]
*  Europe during this trip? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=82.2s)]
*  He had a lot of sweetheart deals [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=84.06s)]
*  that he signed with Serbian and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=86.92s)]
*  Hungarian leaders. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=89.2s)]
*  He made the right noises about [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=90.72s)]
*  what those countries were doing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=93.26s)]
*  and he gave a lot of face to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  those leaders by going and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=97.2s)]
*  visiting and by when you think [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=98.94000000000001s)]
*  about it, so many countries he [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=100.54s)]
*  could visit in Europe, spent a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=102.04s)]
*  little bit of time in France, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=104.0s)]
*  but then mostly it was two [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=105.04s)]
*  countries that are used to being [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=106.54s)]
*  on the periphery. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=108.02000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, when you look at [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  sort of the geopolitical [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=110.58000000000001s)]
*  landscape, though, is there sort [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=111.62s)]
*  of a track record to look at if, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=113.72s)]
*  you know, China makes a promise [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=115.94s)]
*  to invest economically. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=117.98s)]
*  What does that track record look [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=120.88s)]
*  like? Do they have the history of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=122.42s)]
*  coming through with those [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=123.98s)]
*  economic problems? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=125.12s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=125.76s)]
*  A lot of times you'll see really [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=126.58s)]
*  big numbers. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=128.38s)]
*  China signed a multibillion [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=129.62s)]
*  dollar deal with this country or [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=131.26s)]
*  that country, and then you'll [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=133.0s)]
*  actually audit the numbers and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=133.86s)]
*  you'll find, oh, well, this [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=135.02s)]
*  money didn't really go to where [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=136.86s)]
*  it was intended or the investment [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=138.7s)]
*  vehicle only spent five or 10 [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=141.2s)]
*  percent of what they were [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=143.4s)]
*  saying. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=144.64s)]
*  So it's a good note of caution [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=145.12s)]
*  as we see big headlines coming [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=146.62s)]
*  out, realizing a lot of times [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=147.98s)]
*  the money's not actually going [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=150.22s)]
*  to go through. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  So what's the larger strategy [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=151.56s)]
*  then for China in doing that and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  making these very sort of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=155.2s)]
*  grandiose public kind of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  displays of economic commitments [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=158.24s)]
*  to countries like Hungary? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  People forget. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=162.24s)]
*  People see the headline number [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  and they don't actually go [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=165.54s)]
*  through and look and say, OK, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  well, this deal didn't actually [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=168.44s)]
*  go through. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=169.48s)]
*  And so it's a good people [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=170.24s)]
*  remember the big headline [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=171.38s)]
*  numbers. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  They don't follow through what [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=173.32s)]
*  happens after. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=175.38s)]
*  So ultimately, then, Isaac, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  where does this leave the U.S.? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=177.68s)]
*  I mean, what does Xi's visit [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=179.44s)]
*  mean for the U.S.'s influence on [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=181.24s)]
*  that continent? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=183.22s)]
*  I think it was positive because [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=184.38s)]
*  Xi's visit got a lot of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=185.82s)]
*  criticism, not only for the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  human rights abuses that the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=189.62s)]
*  Communist Party represents, but [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=191.36s)]
*  also because Europe is very [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=192.8s)]
*  worried about Russia and Beijing [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=195.96s)]
*  is very supportive. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=198.96s)]
*  And no matter how Xi tries to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  portray Beijing's stance with [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  Moscow, people see the facts on [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  the ground. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=206.68s)]
*  They see Beijing's unwillingness [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=207.18s)]
*  to condemn the war. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=209.12s)]
*  And they realize, if this gets [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=210.52s)]
*  worse, China is going to be more [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  of a problem for Europe than it [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=214.72s)]
*  has been in the past. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=216.02s)]
*  It is part of sort of the idea, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=216.86s)]
*  though, for China, from China's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=220.36s)]
*  perspective, that ultimately, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=222.0s)]
*  the economic investment or at [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=224.10000000000002s)]
*  least the headline of the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  economic investment will sort [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=227.4s)]
*  of trump all. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=228.9s)]
*  And that is enough to kind of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABIq8FN_o4&t=230.10000000000002s)]
