# Ukrainian ambassador vows forces will "liberate all Ukraine" amid counteroffensive
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw)
*  And we are joined now once again by Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markareva. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=0.0s)]
*  Madam Ambassador, good morning to you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=4.76s)]
*  An incredible past few days for your country. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=6.8s)]
*  I wonder, as you have this progress, if concern is growing that Russia will resort to more [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=10.84s)]
*  brutality to respond to the success Ukraine has had? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=18.36s)]
*  Well, our 200 days fall on the September 11. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=23.56s)]
*  And we know this pain and we feel this pain in Ukraine. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=27.64s)]
*  We know how is it when terrorists attack you at home. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=31.68s)]
*  So we always have to keep in mind that Russia still can do a lot of damage. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=34.96s)]
*  But we don't have any other choice. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  We will advance. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  As we said before, we will not surrender and we will liberate all Ukraine because this [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=43.8s)]
*  is what we have to do, not only to restore our territorial integrity, but to save all [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  of our people who are under occupation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  And we see from the footage from more than 1200 square miles, which have been liberated [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=56.44s)]
*  during the past literally eight days, the most fast counteroffensive since the World [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=62.72s)]
*  War Two. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=69.88s)]
*  We see how they are meeting and greeting our armed forces. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=71.4s)]
*  And we also unfortunately see already the signs of the brutal war crimes that have been [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  committed there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=80.56s)]
*  No different from what we saw after we liberated the Kiev Oblast. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  So we have to win. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=86.0s)]
*  And this counteroffensive shows that we can win. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=88.48s)]
*  And we are repeating the success that we had in the Kiev Oblast. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=92.04s)]
*  Retired General Ben Hodges told our David Martin that Ukraine's military could push [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=97.28s)]
*  Russia back to the borders that existed pre-February 24th when the invasion happened. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=101.64s)]
*  And that could happen before the end of the year. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=108.2s)]
*  Do you agree with that timeline? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=111.68s)]
*  Again, this operation was possible because of the resolve of the armed forces, because [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=113.92s)]
*  our commanders from the president to every commander in the battlefield are so devoted [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=120.48s)]
*  to the victory, but also because 40 million of Ukrainians are supporting this effort and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=128.2s)]
*  fighting for our country. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=134.24s)]
*  But more importantly, because our partners have increased all the support and we're [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=136.52s)]
*  getting more and more of the weapons and equipment that is so needed for that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=140.96s)]
*  So of course we would like to liberate all Ukraine as soon as possible to stop the suffering [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  of the people and to restore our sovereignty. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  But whether it will be possible before the end of the year, we are ready to do it before [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=155.12s)]
*  the end of the year. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=159.24s)]
*  And hopefully we will have everything we need to do so. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=160.24s)]
*  The Biden administration made some announcements of further support. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=163.36s)]
*  2.2 billion in long-term military financing for Ukraine and its neighbors. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=167.44000000000003s)]
*  This was just in the past week. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=171.4s)]
*  675 million package of heavy weapons. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=173.16000000000003s)]
*  Your foreign minister tweeted this morning that now it's about schedule, schedule and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  schedule. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=181.0s)]
*  So you're getting these pledges. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=182.0s)]
*  Is there a complaint it's not arriving fast enough? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=183.8s)]
*  We don't have any complaints. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=187.24s)]
*  If you look at August and September, we see that the announcements are very regular and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  we're getting a lot of announcements on a weekly basis. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=196.76s)]
*  We also see, and it's very important and it has been a highlight of this Secretary Blinken's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  visit to Kiev, that we're not only talking about what is necessary right now for us to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=205.98s)]
*  win today, but we are increasingly discussing the long-term support and everything that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  we need in order to build what we call the endurance strength. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=216.92s)]
*  So the US AI package that was announced, 3 billion that was announced on the Independence [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  Day, and this 2.2 billion out of which about 1 billion will go to Ukraine in the foreign [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=225.4s)]
*  financing is not only what we need now, but also what we will need in the coming months [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=231.6s)]
*  and years in order to be able to defend ourselves. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=237.92s)]
*  How much longer does this war last? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=242.12s)]
*  It will last until we win and we definitely would like it to be shorter because the Russians [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=245.72s)]
*  are not only attacking us, they're attacking Europe, the energy crisis, the food crisis, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=253.08s)]
*  everything they're trying to create in order to not only attack Ukraine, but every democracy [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=258.96s)]
*  that is together with us fighting for the democracy now. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=265.28s)]
*  So the faster we do it, the faster we will return to rebuilding and renovating our country, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=269.36s)]
*  but also to some kind of normal life in Europe and globally. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=275.44s)]
*  How should people understand what is happening now with the nuclear reactor in Ukraine? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=280.92s)]
*  The situation is totally unacceptable from any type of international standpoint. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=287.84s)]
*  The Russian armed forces that shouldn't be in Ukraine in the first place and definitely [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=293.08s)]
*  shouldn't be at the nuclear plant, which is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, are putting [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=297.44s)]
*  lives not only of Ukrainians, but also the whole region by being there and doing the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=304.16s)]
*  same things. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=310.92s)]
*  But shutting down the reactor, does that avert catastrophe? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=311.92s)]
*  Well, this is, we're trying everything possible and Ukrainians who are there at the station, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=314.12s)]
*  despite of the fact that they're there under the guns all the time, trying to do everything [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=319.44000000000005s)]
*  possible to minimize the risks. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=323.72s)]
*  So we are forced to do it, we are forced to shut it down. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=325.90000000000003s)]
*  It's not a complete resolution. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=329.3s)]
*  The complete resolution is for Russians to get out, to implement the recommendations [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=331.8s)]
*  of the UAIA and to demilitarize the plant, which means that Russians should leave. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=336.86s)]
*  That will bring their safety. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=343.04s)]
*  But in the meantime, again, the Ukrainian personnel there is doing everything possible [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=345.06s)]
*  in order to avert any type of catastrophes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=349.58000000000004s)]
*  The last time you were here in April, you told us that there were roughly 91,000 Ukrainian [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=352.82s)]
*  children who had been taken from their families and brought into Russia. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=359.58s)]
*  Has there been any progress in bringing them home? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=363.88s)]
*  You asked for the U.S. to help with this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=366.56s)]
*  We are asking everyone and unfortunately with this, fortunately with the counteroffensive, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=368.24s)]
*  but we see already that during the counteroffensive, Russians are trying to move more kids from [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=374.6s)]
*  which we are liberated prior to the liberations to Russia. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=381.46s)]
*  So this issue of identifying and finding every children that Russian stolen from us and return [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=384.46s)]
*  them back safely is still one of the top priorities. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=392.82s)]
*  And hopefully after we win, we will be able to get them all back. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=396.14s)]
*  Very quickly, should we expect your president to come to the United Nations in the coming [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=399.58s)]
*  days in person? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=403.38s)]
*  Can he leave? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=404.86s)]
*  Well, it all depends on the situation on the ground. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=405.86s)]
*  So we cannot say anything right now, but hopefully we will be able to have more good news from [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=408.58s)]
*  Ukraine and more territories to return home. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  That would be significant. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=417.84s)]
*  Thank you, Madam Ambassador. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CjqW_4SXw&t=419.08s)]
