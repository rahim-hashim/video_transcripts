# Watch Trump, Modi address reporters together
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0)
*  But we do want to take you back to the White House where President Trump and Prime Minister Modi are taking questions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=0.0s)]
*  We have seen several groups in the US being raising anti-India voice, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=4.84s)]
*  calling about separation, terrorism activities in India. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that should continue here in the US as well? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=13.32s)]
*  You're going to have to go louder. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=16.32s)]
*  Mr. President, people in India would be welcoming your decision to extradite the HUB or RANA to India. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=18.84s)]
*  I can't understand a word he's saying. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=23.2s)]
*  May I, sir? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=25.6s)]
*  May I? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=27.0s)]
*  May I, sir? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=29.04s)]
*  Go ahead, back there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=30.84s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  First, I want to ask the Prime Minister a question. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=33.2s)]
*  You and the President, you both spoke about combating ISIS. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=36.6s)]
*  You both sounded very excited about this partnership upcoming. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=40.0s)]
*  And I was curious, how much more confident are you with President Trump leading this country [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  that there will be peace through strength and you will have a successful partnership with the United States [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=52.52s)]
*  versus with Biden's incompetence and weakness over the last four years? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=59.0s)]
*  That's your question, but I'll answer it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=74.2s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, gross incompetence. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=77.84s)]
*  We're going to have a fantastic relationship. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=80.84s)]
*  And it has been like the whole world has been set back over the last four years by the weakness of the United States, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=82.84s)]
*  the weak leadership of the United States. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=88.92s)]
*  But I think we've taken care of it in just three weeks. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  It seems to me that even some of the media that we wouldn't prefer has been writing that this is a much different country right now, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  that the world has a light over it, not only our country, but the whole world. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=101.8s)]
*  The Prime Minister told me that before, too, even over India. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=106.72s)]
*  The world has a light. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=109.48s)]
*  They need the United States to be strong and powerful, but good. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=110.48s)]
*  And I think that's happened. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=115.08s)]
*  And I think it's happened in a very short period of time. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  But I will tell you, we're going to have a fantastic relationship and it'll make both countries much stronger. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  Yes, go ahead, please. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=130.44s)]
*  OK, Geeta Mohan from India Today, sir. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  I'll just take my colleague Lalit Jha's question forward because you can understand. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=138.92s)]
*  OK, fine. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  The question is about the fact that you've decided to extradite Tahir Rana. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=144.83999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  India has been waiting to have him back in India to bring him to justice. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=151.44s)]
*  But there are many other elements in the United States of America, particularly Khalistani separatists who've been working against Indian interests. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  How is the United States of America going to cooperate on that front with India? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=166.2s)]
*  There are there have been allegations that have been leveled against Indian agencies by the Biden administration. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=171.12s)]
*  Are you going to relook that with Tulsi Gabbard as DNI now? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=177.6s)]
*  Well, I don't think India had a very good relationship with the Biden administration. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=182.0s)]
*  Biden, they wouldn't sell them oil and gas, which is rather hard to believe, because, you know, it's a good thing to do. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=185.84s)]
*  And a lot of things happened that weren't very appropriate. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=192.92s)]
*  I thought between India and the administration, the Biden administration. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=196.0s)]
*  But as you said, we're giving a very violent man, it seems to me. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=199.44s)]
*  I mean, I don't know that he's been convicted yet or will be. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=205.24s)]
*  But let's assume he's a pretty violent person. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=208.12s)]
*  We're giving him back to India immediately. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=211.4s)]
*  And there are more to follow because we have quite a few requests. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=214.12s)]
*  So we work with India on crime and we want to make it good for India. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=218.60000000000002s)]
*  And it's very important. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=222.84s)]
*  So that kind of a relationship is very important to us. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=224.12s)]
*  OK, go ahead, please. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=227.36s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=234.44s)]
*  You've repeatedly called India a big abuser of trade and said it is really difficult to do business in India because of tariffs. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=235.8s)]
*  You announced reciprocal tariffs today. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=244.32s)]
*  I am hoping you can speak about what kind of reciprocal tariffs India can expect. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=246.88s)]
*  Are you willing to make any concessions? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=252.16s)]
*  And how can India head off these tariffs? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  I also have one for the prime minister. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=257.32s)]
*  Well, it has been to us just about the highest tariffed nation anywhere in the world. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=260.12s)]
*  They've been very strong on tariffs. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=267.12s)]
*  And I don't blame them necessarily, but it's a different way of doing business. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=268.68s)]
*  It's very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=272.24s)]
*  We are right now a reciprocal nation. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=278.8s)]
*  We are going to if it's India or if it's somebody else with low tariffs, we're going to have the same. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  We're going to have whatever India charges, we're charging them whatever another country charges, we're charging them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=287.44s)]
*  So it's called reciprocal, which I think is a very fair way. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=292.32000000000005s)]
*  We didn't have that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=296.44000000000005s)]
*  We I was going to do that in my other term. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  And we had the greatest economy ever in the world. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  There's never been an economy like we had. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  And then we got hit with covid. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  We had to focus on that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=307.08s)]
*  And I wasn't really in the mood to be putting it on Italy and Spain and France and India, frankly, and a lot of other countries, because the world was very troubled until we got rid of that nightmare. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=308.56s)]
*  But we had the strongest economy anywhere in the world during that fairly long period of time during my first term, as you know. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=320.96s)]
*  And we didn't do the tariffs. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=327.88s)]
*  We would have done the reciprocal tariffs, but we decided and I decided, I think on a human basis, on a humane basis, not to do them because of the fact that there was such suffering all over the world. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  The last thing we needed to talk about is trade problems. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=342.8s)]
*  But now we do we're doing we see a tremendous future for our country. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=346.68s)]
*  But we felt that now it's finally time after 45 or 50 years of abuse that we will do. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  And this isn't India. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=357.6s)]
*  This is among a lot of nations. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=359.0s)]
*  The European Union is very difficult for us. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=361.36s)]
*  Very, very difficult. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=364.4s)]
*  They they tax our companies at levels that nobody's ever seen before. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=365.44s)]
*  They take advantage of a lot of things. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=369.96s)]
*  So we're not happy about that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=371.92s)]
*  China, of course, is terrible. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=373.16s)]
*  And we've never taken in 10 cents until I was president. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=374.64s)]
*  We've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars from China since I've been president in first term and and now. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=378.44s)]
*  And we have to do that just as a mechanism of fairness. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=385.2s)]
*  And that's what I've done. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=389.36s)]
*  And so we are being reciprocal with India, whatever India charges, we charge them. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=390.84s)]
*  So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge, because whatever they charge. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=396.56s)]
*  I had discussions with India in the first term about the fact that their tariffs were very high and I was unable to get a concession. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=402.68s)]
*  So we're just going to do it the easy way. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=411.96s)]
*  We're just going to say whatever you charge, we charge. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think that's fair for the people of the United States. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  And I think it's actually fair for India. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=426.76s)]
*  Ask to the Prime Minister, please. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=430.0s)]
*  Ask to the Prime Minister, please. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=431.88s)]
*  Sorry, Yoshita Singh with Press Trust of India. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=434.32s)]
*  Prime Minister. Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=436.91999999999996s)]
*  Prime Minister, the US is giving a lot of push to curb illegal immigration and India has been cooperating on this issue. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=438.72s)]
*  How does India see this issue in the larger context? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=447.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=450.12s)]
*  I don't think this is a question that is about India only, but even globally, you can talk about this issue. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=455.44s)]
*  And we are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, they [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=462.44s)]
*  they have absolutely no right to be in that country. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=478.68s)]
*  And as far as India and the US is concerned, we have always been of the same opinion. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=483.08s)]
*  And that is that any verified Indian who is in the US illegally, we are fully prepared to take them back to India. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=489.92s)]
*  However, it doesn't stop there. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  These are children of very ordinary families and they are lured by big dreams and big promises. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=510.68s)]
*  A lot of them are brought in without them knowing about why they're going to a country. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=521.0s)]
*  And in fact, they are connected with a human trafficking system. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=528.88s)]
*  And we have to make sure that we fight against this system. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=534.2s)]
*  As far as the US and India is concerned, I think what we should do is make efforts to make sure that we uproot these from within the system so that we can reduce or remove human trafficking. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  And basically, the young, vulnerable, poor people of India are fooled into coming over as illegal immigrants. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=554.48s)]
*  And our bigger fight actually is against this ecosystem or this system that encourages such gangs to thrive. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=563.84s)]
*  And I can tell you that India will completely support your endeavor in achieving this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=571.88s)]
*  Yes, thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=579.12s)]
*  The question from Prime Minister Modi first, if I may, I wanted to ask you, did you discuss any possible business deals with Elon Musk during your your meetings today? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. President, I wanted to ask you today. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  You spoke about hoping to have three way talks with President Xi and President Putin. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=595.16s)]
*  But what would you say to European leaders and other allies who may be concerned that you're apparently more keen to speak to America's adversaries than to its allies? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=601.96s)]
*  Thank you. Maybe I'll just go in first on this one. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=611.6s)]
*  We had some talks and we told the European Union, we told the NATO people largely they overlap. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=616.6s)]
*  You have to pay more money because it's unfair what we're doing. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=627.8000000000001s)]
*  We're doing a tremendous amount more, with probably 200 billion dollars more going into Ukraine, using for Ukraine to fight. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=631.52s)]
*  And Europe has not really carried its weight in terms of the money. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=642.88s)]
*  It's not equitable. And we want to see a counterbalance. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=647.1600000000001s)]
*  We want to have them put up more money. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=650.72s)]
*  They have to do that. At the same time, we had a very good conversation with President Putin the other day yesterday, and we also had a very good conversation. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=653.0s)]
*  I did both in both cases with President Zelensky, and I think we're going to be able to do something. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=661.4000000000001s)]
*  I think we're going to be able to make a deal. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=667.9599999999999s)]
*  And I hope so because it's a horrible war. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=670.16s)]
*  It's a very terrible, bloody war with a million and a half soldiers, at least already dead on the battlefield, lying all over the fields like nobody's ever seen anything like it since certainly since the Second World War. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=672.28s)]
*  And so I think we're going to be able to do something. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=684.4399999999999s)]
*  We're working with President Zelensky and with President Putin. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=687.28s)]
*  And my impression is that they I know that President Zelensky wants to make a deal. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=691.68s)]
*  And I also feel that I know that President Putin wants to make a deal. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=697.2s)]
*  I wanted to know that before I began any detailed discussions. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=701.0s)]
*  But the meeting and the conversation, also the meeting with Steve Witkoff in Moscow was a very successful one. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=704.96s)]
*  And my phone call with him was a very successful one. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  Please. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=716.0400000000001s)]
*  You asked a question regarding Elon Musk. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=722.88s)]
*  I have known him for a very long time. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=726.76s)]
*  I was not even a prime minister at the time when I first met him. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=729.0799999999999s)]
*  I was chief minister. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=733.5999999999999s)]
*  And today he came to meet me along with all his family, with his children. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=735.4799999999999s)]
*  And so we had a nice discussion. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=740.4399999999999s)]
*  As far as the EV is concerned, EVs are concerned. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=745.3599999999999s)]
*  The word EV has a copyright. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=751.64s)]
*  And that is one person who has a copyright for the word EV. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=756.4s)]
*  And that is Trump. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=759.76s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=770.4s)]
*  Can I ask whether you discussed at all today the case of Ghatam Adani, who's one of the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=771.4s)]
*  wealthiest men in Asia and perceived as an ally of Prime Minister Modi? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=777.08s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi, have you asked the President to take action on that case? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=780.8000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=785.08s)]
*  Firstly, India is a democratic country. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=789.6800000000001s)]
*  And our culture and our thought, philosophy is, which basically means that the entire [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=795.84s)]
*  world is a family. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=803.32s)]
*  Every Indian is my own family member. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=805.52s)]
*  When it comes to such personal matters, leaders of two countries will not get together on [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=809.24s)]
*  that topic and discuss anything on an individual matter. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=815.9599999999999s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=818.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=821.9599999999999s)]
*  Sir, go ahead, please. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=824.9599999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=827.9599999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=829.8s)]
*  I have a question for you as well. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=830.8s)]
*  But Mr. President, you have suggested, with regards to the Russia-Ukraine war, you've [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=832.3199999999999s)]
*  suggested several things that Ukraine should give up, the idea of NATO membership, territory [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=836.52s)]
*  that was seized back in 2014 by Russia. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=842.48s)]
*  What should Russia give up? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=845.3199999999999s)]
*  Russia has gotten themselves into something that I think they wish they didn't. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=848.76s)]
*  If I were president, it would not have happened. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=853.84s)]
*  Absolutely would not have happened. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=856.36s)]
*  And it didn't happen for four years. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=858.0799999999999s)]
*  If you look at what has taken place under President Bush, they lost a lot. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=860.34s)]
*  Under President Obama, they lost Crimea. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=866.46s)]
*  Under Biden, it looks like they could lose the whole thing. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=871.7800000000001s)]
*  Under Trump, they lost nothing. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=874.6800000000001s)]
*  Ukraine lost nothing. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=876.5s)]
*  They didn't give up anything. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=877.5s)]
*  And you take a look at the other three presidents surrounding me, they gave up a lot. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=880.0600000000001s)]
*  I think that when you look at Ukraine and when you look at the mess that they're in, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=886.8199999999999s)]
*  it's got to be ended and it's got to be stopped. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=892.9399999999999s)]
*  Now, Russia has taken over a pretty big chunk of territory. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=895.22s)]
*  And they also have said from day one, long before President Putin, they've said they [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=900.9s)]
*  cannot have Ukraine be a NATO. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=906.18s)]
*  They said that very strongly. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=908.0799999999999s)]
*  I actually think that that was the thing that caused the start of the war. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=910.1s)]
*  Biden said it and Zelensky said it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=913.58s)]
*  And I think that was one of the reasons, one of the starts of the war. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=918.1800000000001s)]
*  But from long before Putin, they said, you cannot have Ukraine going in in any way into [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=922.1s)]
*  NATO. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=929.38s)]
*  And I start from that standpoint. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=931.34s)]
*  I think everybody knew that. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=934.0200000000001s)]
*  Now, if a better deal can be negotiated, if they're able to make a deal where they can [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=935.5s)]
*  do that, that's fine with me. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=941.22s)]
*  I really don't care. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=942.46s)]
*  I want that bloodshed to stop. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=944.34s)]
*  I don't want to see — you know, we have an ocean between us and the site we're talking [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=947.1800000000001s)]
*  about, the site of death. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=952.58s)]
*  We're calling it the fields of death. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=953.7s)]
*  We have a big ocean in between us. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=956.1s)]
*  This is more important for Europe. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=958.22s)]
*  We shouldn't be in. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=960.44s)]
*  They have to equalize. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=961.44s)]
*  And they're going to have to do it fast, but they have to equalize. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=962.44s)]
*  But as far as the negotiation, it's too early to say what's going to happen. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=965.34s)]
*  Maybe Russia will give up a lot. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=970.52s)]
*  Maybe they won't. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=972.36s)]
*  It's all dependent on what is going to happen. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=974.26s)]
*  The negotiation really hasn't started. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=975.92s)]
*  But I will say, as far as NATO is concerned, from many years before President Putin, I [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=978.28s)]
*  will tell you that I've heard that Russia would never accept that. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=983.48s)]
*  And I think Ukraine knew that because Ukraine wasn't in and never requested to be in until [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=987.2s)]
*  more recently. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=992.16s)]
*  So that's the way it is, and I think that's the way it's going to have to be. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=993.16s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=996.5600000000001s)]
*  All right, go ahead, please, with the tie. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=999.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1002.76s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1004.76s)]
*  Yes, go ahead. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1005.76s)]
*  This is Saurabh Shukla from Newsbobel. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1006.76s)]
*  Mr. President, you spoke about Prime Minister Modi as a tough negotiator. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1008.56s)]
*  Who was a tougher negotiator today and who has a better negotiating tactic when it comes [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1012.56s)]
*  to tariffs? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1017.26s)]
*  Oh, he's a much tougher negotiator than me, and he's a much better negotiator than me. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1018.26s)]
*  There's not even a contest. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1022.16s)]
*  Okay? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1023.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead, please. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1025.3600000000001s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1031.3600000000001s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1032.3600000000001s)]
*  Reena Bhardwaj from ANI. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1033.3600000000001s)]
*  How do you see this relationship between India and the United States to counter China? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1036.16s)]
*  And what is your vision when it comes to India, you know, brokering peace in the Ukraine and [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1041.8s)]
*  Russia conflict? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1049.2s)]
*  Well, I think we're going to have a very good relationship with China. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1050.2s)]
*  I got along with President Xi very well until COVID. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1053.6799999999998s)]
*  That was a bridge too far. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1056.08s)]
*  But until then, I got along with President Xi very, very well. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1058.2s)]
*  We were very close as leaders go. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1061.1799999999998s)]
*  I don't want to be naive, but as leaders go, I think we were very close. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1064.56s)]
*  And I think that China is a very important player in the world. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1069.4399999999998s)]
*  I think they can help us get this war over with Ukraine and Russia. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1073.28s)]
*  And I look at India, I do see the skirmishes on the border, which are quite vicious. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1077.4399999999998s)]
*  And I guess they continue to go on. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1083.84s)]
*  If I could be of help, I'd love to help because that should be stopped. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1086.28s)]
*  That's been going on for a long time. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1089.1999999999998s)]
*  And it's quite violent. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1091.76s)]
*  It's quite violent. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1093.4399999999998s)]
*  But I would hope that China and India and Russia and U.S. and all of us can get along. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1094.4399999999998s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1101.84s)]
*  You know, the power of weaponry today is — and not only nuclear, but nuclear in particular [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1103.72s)]
*  — the power of weaponry is very important. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1109.04s)]
*  And I said before that I had very constructive talks in my first term with President Putin [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1111.32s)]
*  about the denuclearization of the two countries, and then we were going to go to China after [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1118.1200000000001s)]
*  we worked some kind of a deal. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1124.3600000000001s)]
*  And we — at the confines of a deal, we were — I thought he really wanted to do it, so [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1126.56s)]
*  did I — denuclearize. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1131.68s)]
*  And it's so — it's such a beautiful term, when you think about it. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1133.88s)]
*  In other words, to bring it down because the power of those weapons is too great. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1137.4399999999998s)]
*  And I did speak to President Xi about that, and I was getting also a very good response. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1142.8s)]
*  He's building a very strong nuclear power. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1147.8799999999999s)]
*  He's not very close to Russia or the United States right now, but he will be soon. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1151.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, he'll catch up over the period of four or five years, they say. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1155.6399999999999s)]
*  But it would be a great thing if we could, on a military basis — we're going to spend [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1161.04s)]
*  this year, $900 — let's say $915 billion on military. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1164.3999999999999s)]
*  Russia without the war was spending close to $100, but with the war — I can't tell [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1171.04s)]
*  you what they're spending, but they're spending a lot, and China is spending $400 and $450 [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1174.9599999999998s)]
*  billion. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1179.76s)]
*  We're over $900 billion. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1180.76s)]
*  And I said, you know, it doesn't really make sense, does it? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1182.8s)]
*  We're spending the money against each other, and we could spend that money for better purpose [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1186.08s)]
*  if we got along. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1192.4399999999998s)]
*  I'll tell you, I think that something like that will happen. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1193.52s)]
*  First, when I left, as you know, four years ago, we didn't have Israel and the Middle [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1197.24s)]
*  East. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1202.96s)]
*  We didn't have October 7th — a disaster, the disaster. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1203.96s)]
*  Nothing was happening. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1208.1200000000001s)]
*  Iran was not going to do anything because Iran did not have much money at that point. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1209.1200000000001s)]
*  They were broke. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1214.3600000000001s)]
*  They were totally broke. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1215.3600000000001s)]
*  They didn't have money for Hamas or for Hezbollah. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1216.48s)]
*  And you didn't have Russia with Ukraine, and that would never have happened. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1219.56s)]
*  But now I come back and I have — the whole world is on fire, so I have to put out the [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1224.3600000000001s)]
*  fires. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1227.3200000000002s)]
*  But after I put out the fires, I'm going to meet with China and I'm going to meet with [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1228.3200000000002s)]
*  Russia and we're going to see if we can de-escalate, if we can bring it down — military, especially [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1231.44s)]
*  as it pertains to nuclear. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1236.72s)]
*  Please. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1238.68s)]
*  Prime Minister, how do you see India's role? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1239.68s)]
*  You have had discussions with President Trump about de-escalating the conflict in Russia [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1260.96s)]
*  and Ukraine. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1268.36s)]
*  As you know, I have been in constant contact with both Russia and Ukraine. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1269.8s)]
*  I have also visited both countries. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1279.3999999999999s)]
*  And many people are mistaken and they feel that India is neutral. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1283.4799999999998s)]
*  I would like to clarify, India is not neutral. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1288.6799999999998s)]
*  We have taken a side and we have taken the side of peace. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1294.1200000000001s)]
*  And it is based on this principle of ours that in the presence of President Putin, I [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1302.28s)]
*  clearly said in front of the media that this is not the era of war. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1312.92s)]
*  And even today, it is my conviction that solutions cannot be found on the battlefield. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1317.52s)]
*  Ultimately, you have to come to the negotiating table. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1325.28s)]
*  And India has constantly made efforts that there are talks that take place where both [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1330.24s)]
*  parties are present. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1337.76s)]
*  It is only then that we will find a solution. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1339.34s)]
*  The efforts being made by President Trump, I support them. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1342.8s)]
*  I welcome them. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1348.56s)]
*  And I would like that President Trump is successful as soon as possible so that the world is on [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1350.8s)]
*  the path to peace once again. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1358.32s)]
*  Everybody, thank you very much. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1360.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1364.24s)]
*  We've been listening to President Trump speak alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1365.24s)]
*  They just took questions and the pair talked about bolstering their relationship. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1369.0s)]
*  Working together to strengthen military cooperation. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1373.0s)]
*  President Trump addressed reciprocal tariffs and trade negotiations with India, reiterating [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1375.9199999999998s)]
*  that the U.S. would match tariffs imposed by other nations. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1380.52s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1384.36s)]
*  Major, the president saying he had discussions with India in his first term that their tariffs [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1387.76s)]
*  were too high. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1391.8799999999999s)]
*  They do charge average of 12 percent tariffs, which is one of the high among the highest [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1393.24s)]
*  according to one of our sources, that he wasn't able to get a concession from India in his [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1397.84s)]
*  first term and said, we'll do it the easy way and say whatever you charge, we charge. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1403.08s)]
*  But notably, we didn't get Modi's perspective on that. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1407.2s)]
*  No, we didn't. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1410.92s)]
*  Most foreign leaders in these conversations with President Trump understand that the threat [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1412.32s)]
*  of tariffs is something that is negotiable. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1416.3s)]
*  Across all goods imported into the United States, the average Indian tariff is about [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1418.92s)]
*  nine and a half percent. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1423.6399999999999s)]
*  It aggregates out to 12 percent in sum, but across the average is about nine and a half. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1424.76s)]
*  U.S. tariffs about three percent. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1429.24s)]
*  So if you equalize that, that would mean either the Indian tariffs would have to come down [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1430.24s)]
*  or U.S. ones would go up. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1434.5200000000002s)]
*  This is all subject to negotiation. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1436.6000000000001s)]
*  And one of the things that they're negotiating about is arms purchases from the United States. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1438.92s)]
*  India is one of the largest consumers of military machinery in the world. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1444.0800000000002s)]
*  Its largest supplier currently, Russia. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1449.3000000000002s)]
*  Sixty-two percent of India's military imports come from Russia. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1451.96s)]
*  The United States would like to eat into that Russian supply of military equipment that [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1455.36s)]
*  goes into India. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1459.96s)]
*  And there are conversations going on right now on a joint combat vehicle and a joint [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1460.96s)]
*  aircraft to be made by the United States with India. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1466.24s)]
*  That's one of the things this administration is trying to negotiate with India. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1470.28s)]
*  And the threat of tariffs is part of the leverage of that conversation. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1474.6s)]
*  We know that Modi met with Elon Musk and he was asked whether he made any business deals. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1478.0s)]
*  We didn't really get clarity on that, other than Modi saying that he's known him for a [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1482.26s)]
*  long time and that Trump has a copyright on EVs. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1485.26s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not sure about the whole copyright on EV things, but it is worth pointing out [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1487.66s)]
*  that Tesla is losing a bit of market share. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1493.22s)]
*  One of its biggest competitors and rivals is EVs manufactured in China. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1497.46s)]
*  And Elon Musk would very much like Tesla to get into the Indian EV market. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1503.02s)]
*  I'm sure it was part of the conversation, but the Indian prime minister was nothing [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1507.7s)]
*  if not opaque on the specifics. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1511.82s)]
*  What else did you take away from that, Major? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1513.66s)]
*  So the Indian prime minister said it is perceived that India is neutral in the war between Russia [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1516.02s)]
*  and Ukraine, where Russia was the aggressor. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1522.4s)]
*  Why does that perception exist? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1525.54s)]
*  Because when that war began, when Russia invaded Ukraine, India, the world's largest democracy, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1527.4s)]
*  had nothing to say about it. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1533.18s)]
*  And maintain for months and months and months a position of neutrality, not saying that [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1534.98s)]
*  Russia had done what everyone else had fairly concluded that it had done, imposed itself [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1540.7s)]
*  upon the sovereignty of a democratic country, Ukraine. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1545.94s)]
*  India did not weigh in on that at all, much to the consternation of the Biden administration [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1550.22s)]
*  and many in Congress, Republicans and Democrats. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1554.54s)]
*  Now the prime minister says, well, we're for peace, but on what terms? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1557.34s)]
*  And when you listen to President Trump talking about President Putin in Russia, about China, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1562.06s)]
*  which has allied with Russia in its war against Ukraine, and India saying, well, we just want [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1566.06s)]
*  peace, but never really saying that Russia was the snarling aggressor in that war. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1570.06s)]
*  You have to feel, as many Europeans do, and the Ukrainians fear, that the contours of [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1574.94s)]
*  a future negotiated settlement might not represent Ukraine's interests as strongly as certainly [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1579.46s)]
*  President Zelensky would like or the Ukrainian people would like. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1584.4199999999998s)]
*  Major Garrett, setting the record straight. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1587.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1589.6599999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bkDwidkzC0&t=1590.66s)]
