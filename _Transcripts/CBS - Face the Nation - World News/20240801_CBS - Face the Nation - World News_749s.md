# Inside the major prisoner swap between Russia, U.S. and other countries
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Lana Zach. Thank you for joining us once again here on CBS News 24-7. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=0.0s)]
*  It is a big breaking news day. The United States has secured the release of three Americans [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=6.08s)]
*  who were being held prisoner in Russia. Now they are heading home. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=11.42s)]
*  The deal includes Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gurskiewicz. He was sentenced to 16 years [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=15.48s)]
*  in a maximum security prison on espionage charges just two weeks ago. Marine veteran [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  Paul Whelan, who has been imprisoned for almost six years, is part of this exchange. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=25.54s)]
*  And Russian-American journalist also, Kumasheva, was also included in the deal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=30.34s)]
*  Now the home page of the Wall Street Journal proclaims that their reporter, Evan Gurskiewicz, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=36.34s)]
*  is free. The release of these prisoners was part of a historically complex prisoner swap [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=41.06s)]
*  between six different countries, including the U.S. and Russia. In total, 24 prisoners [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=46.58s)]
*  are being released. Eight of them will be returned to Russia. CBS News intelligence [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=51.66s)]
*  and national security reporter Olivia Gazes is following this for us from Washington. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=56.059999999999995s)]
*  Olivia, until that plane is in the air, there's always a bit of anxiety about this, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=60.9s)]
*  particularly because this was such a complicated, major international effort. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=66.5s)]
*  Talk to us about how all of these countries were able to coordinate this prisoner swap. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=71.1s)]
*  Absolutely, Lana. I think hundreds of people have been waiting to exhale. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=75.66s)]
*  And when the wheels of that plane left the tarmac, finally were able to. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  Officials have been telling me, ones who were intimately involved in this deal, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=83.86s)]
*  that it has been the most complex in the history of U.S.-Russian relations and possibly even U.S.-Soviet [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=88.38s)]
*  relations, when, as we all know, spy swaps hit a crescendo during the Cold War. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=95.06s)]
*  And the reason for that, as we're learning now, is the sheer number of countries involved and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=99.42s)]
*  the fact that this has involved political prisoners and not spies. We're just now learning [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  that there were more than six countries involved, if you look at the numbers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  The U.S., Slovenia, Poland, Norway, Russia, of course, Turkey offering the swap site. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=113.22s)]
*  As a result, three U.S. citizens are coming home in addition to one Green Card holder, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=120.98s)]
*  Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is also opting to come to the United States. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=125.86s)]
*  We have 12 German nationals and Russian political prisoners heading to Germany. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=131.46s)]
*  Now they are free. And in exchange, we have eight Russian nationals going back to Russia, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=136.45999999999998s)]
*  among them a cyber criminal held by the United States, a money launderer, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=141.61999999999998s)]
*  and perhaps most importantly, Vadim Krasikov, who the Russians have had their eye on. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=145.61999999999998s)]
*  This is a former FSB agent and a convicted murderer who had been serving a life sentence [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=150.17999999999998s)]
*  in Germany, now a free man, heading back to Moscow. This has also involved multiple [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=155.94s)]
*  government agencies. And while U.S. officials, we understand, tried to keep these discussions [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=160.98s)]
*  about Evan and Paul in diplomatic channels so as not to give credence to the espionage [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=165.7s)]
*  allegations brought by Russia against them, the Russians, in fact, insisted that negotiations [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=171.38s)]
*  take place in intelligence channels, and the CIA has been instrumental in this breakthrough. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=176.5s)]
*  All right, Olivia, thank you so much. We want to bring in now CBS News senior foreign correspondent [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=181.22s)]
*  Elizabeth Palmer. She's in London. Elizabeth, you have been following particularly the case [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=186.42s)]
*  of Paul Whelan extensively. You were, you've spoken with his family. You were in court. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=191.7s)]
*  How did this trial play out? What were the efforts to get him freed? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  He's the one who has been held the longest, almost six years. And he, we were there when he [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=204.1s)]
*  was arrested. He was arrested in December of 2018, and he appeared first in court in January. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  The trial was closed, but they, as is often the case, and we saw in Gershkovich too, the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=218.18s)]
*  reporters are allowed into the courtroom briefly to have a look at the prisoner, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=223.78s)]
*  and then they are thrown out. So we never got to hear any of the evidence. On the face of it, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=227.78s)]
*  he had gone to a wedding in Russia. He was in his hotel in the lobby, came down to the lobby, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=235.06s)]
*  and suddenly the FSB picked him up. They said that he was in possession of a thumb drive in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=241.46s)]
*  his pocket that contained all kinds of classified information. But none of that was ever introduced [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=247.22s)]
*  into the public domain. The American government has been categorical. It was a completely false [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=255.94s)]
*  accusation. In effect, Paul Whelan was a poker chip for something that Russia might want to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=262.9s)]
*  trade for later, which appears to have happened today. And let's talk about that idea of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=268.5s)]
*  political prisoners as poker chips, because as you have been reporting, this doesn't bring every [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  American home, and that there are some that are still in Russian prisons that objectively those [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=280.18s)]
*  are for criminal acts. But then there are others, like the case of Ksenia Karylina, who allegedly [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=285.62s)]
*  contributed to a pro-Ukrainian protest and is now being held on charges of treason. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=293.06s)]
*  As we celebrate the return of these Americans, talk to us about how others may still be used [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=302.41999999999996s)]
*  as poker chips and how their families are probably doing right now. Well, as I counted up how many [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=307.94s)]
*  there are, and I believe there are seven, of those six have been arrested on criminal charges, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=315.14s)]
*  everything from embezzlement and bribery to hitting a policeman while drunk on a train. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=322.17999999999995s)]
*  These are less likely to have had evidence fabricated. They have just plain old criminal [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=329.38s)]
*  charges, and their families will be devastated, but perhaps more resigned. In some cases, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=336.02s)]
*  the sentences are much shorter, three years, four years, something like that. As you said, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  the one that really stands out is Ksenia Karylina. She contributed, according to her family and her [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=348.18s)]
*  lawyers, $50 to a fund that supported Ukrainian forces. But she has been charged with the most [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=356.97999999999996s)]
*  serious of crimes in Russia, treason. That means that her trial will be a secret. And she could [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  go down for 20 years. Now, the trial has been paused. It's not clear why she wasn't included [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=375.21999999999997s)]
*  in this swap. But it may be because her trial was underway, which is unfortunate for her. We know in [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=381.94s)]
*  the case, for example, of Gurshkovich, the Russians said, listen, we will trade him, but his trial has [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=390.42s)]
*  to be finished before we can actually negotiate the swap. So it may be just a case of terrible luck [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=396.74s)]
*  for Karylina. And we won't know until she goes back into court, and we see whether there is [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=405.3s)]
*  any kind of an effort to get her sentence done, too. But certainly her family will be [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  heartbroken because she isn't among the very happy group who are heading home. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=420.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And of course, it's worth saying that this deal doesn't preclude other deals from happening. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=426.5s)]
*  And I'm curious, Elizabeth, given your expertise in all of this, does it seem more likely that deals [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=433.29999999999995s)]
*  might be able to be agreed upon in the future? Given that Russia-U.S. relations are at this [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=441.85999999999996s)]
*  very low point, it is historic that this deal has happened. Might it pave the way for better relations? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=449.85999999999996s)]
*  I wish. She asked optimistically, right? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=459.05999999999995s)]
*  I think not. I mean, I think it's extraordinary that as U.S.-Russia relations are at the lowest ebb [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=463.46s)]
*  in decades, this was able to happen. It's amazing and very good for all those involved. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=469.94s)]
*  It's the largest prisoner exchange in—since the end of the Cold War, so in the modern era, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=478.18s)]
*  with Russia. You have to go back to Soviet times in 1985, when Polish intelligence officer Marian [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=484.58s)]
*  Zakarski was traded in Berlin for 23 Westerners who had been jailed across the Soviet bloc for [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=494.02s)]
*  spying. And that was a real Cold War swap. It took place on the notorious Bridge of Spies [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=502.18s)]
*  in Berlin. It was real Cold War stuff. This is a much more modern iteration. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=508.02s)]
*  I suppose if we want to be optimistic, if this prisoner swap could be negotiated now, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=514.5799999999999s)]
*  it could be negotiated anytime, because relations just couldn't be worse. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=521.46s)]
*  All right. Elizabeth Palmer, thank you very much. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=525.78s)]
*  We want to go now to Ambassador William Taylor. He's the vice president of Europe and Russia at [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=531.54s)]
*  the U.S. Institute of Peace. He's also the former United States ambassador to Ukraine. Ambassador, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=537.14s)]
*  good to have you here. Talk to us first of all about the process and all the political nuances [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=542.18s)]
*  involved with getting these detained Americans released, especially given the complexity of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=548.02s)]
*  multiple countries being involved. Absolutely. This has been in the works for some time, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=554.18s)]
*  apparently, with all these different countries making a contribution. It makes it very complicated, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=560.74s)]
*  but also emphasizes the importance of having good allies. All these nations that we're talking about [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=565.86s)]
*  here are our allies, are working with us. And they've kept it quiet. The amazing thing is it [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=570.9s)]
*  hasn't leaked out. And it came to a success. So this is a good day for the American diplomacy. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=577.38s)]
*  Our viewers are looking at a map with all the different, the six different countries [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=584.34s)]
*  that were involved in this highlighted. And one of those in particular I want to talk to you about, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=588.98s)]
*  Germany, because they had a prisoner that Russia really wanted released in this deal. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=592.58s)]
*  Talk to us about what Germany has to gain by agreeing to cooperate, what sorts of agreements [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=598.74s)]
*  and incentives they may have had to release this prisoner in order for the U.S. to get these three [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=605.7s)]
*  Americans home. Well, we understand that there were some Germans that were also released. So the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=610.6600000000001s)]
*  Germans did get their 12 Germans out. You are exactly right. The Americans, we Americans got [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=618.1s)]
*  these high-profile three that have been in the news and held up as a problem. And now they are [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=626.4200000000001s)]
*  coming back. So the Germans, the Americans did get some. And then the other allies helped out. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=633.62s)]
*  So this was a complex negotiation. The Germans came out ahead. The Americans came out ahead. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=640.9s)]
*  And in terms of complex allies, Turkey played a major role in this prisoner swap. And if our [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=646.5s)]
*  control room can do so, I'd like to put back up some of those images of the planes on the tarmac [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=652.58s)]
*  there in Ankara. And we are going to watch as hopefully this plane takes off right now. We're [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=658.66s)]
*  continuing to watch this. But when we talk about Turkey's role in actually being the physical [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6-hD4hiak&t=664.66s)]
