# What to know about the changes to U.S.-Japan relations
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0)
*  President Biden used all of the tools of hospitality to announce deeper ties with Japan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=0.0s)]
*  He welcomed Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to the White House Wednesday for a day of meetings, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=7.0s)]
*  capped with a lavish state dinner. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=12.56s)]
*  The two leaders announced plans to upgrade military command and control operations, integrate [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=14.86s)]
*  their air defense networks, and bring Japan along for a U.S. mission to the moon. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=19.48s)]
*  Together, our countries are taking significant steps to strengthen defense-security cooperation, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=25.16s)]
*  for modernizing command and control structures, and to increase the interoperability and planning [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=30.68s)]
*  of our militaries so they can work together in a seamless and effective way. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  This is the most significant upgrade in our alliance since the end of, since it was first [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=40.52s)]
*  established. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  CBS News Senior White House correspondent Weijia Zhang joins me now from the White House. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Weijia, much of this visit is about bolstering military cooperation between the U.S. and Japan. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=51.68s)]
*  The two countries already have a relationship, so what's changing now? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=57.080000000000005s)]
*  Well, this is exactly how they are framing it, John, that this is really upgrading the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=60.84s)]
*  existing relationship between these two militaries. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  And so there will be more of an integration between the two militaries. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=69.88s)]
*  The Pentagon will work out those details, especially to upgrade the current U.S. command [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=74.64s)]
*  center in Japan, which hosts about 54,000 U.S. troops. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=80.32s)]
*  And they also have plans to work with Australia to establish a joint air defense system, as [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=85.24s)]
*  well as look at ways to produce defense weapons together. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  So it's all about expanding on what already exists. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=95.69999999999999s)]
*  And the two leaders, as I understand it, are having a meeting with the Philippines on Thursday. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=100.22s)]
*  So what's everybody meeting about and having all these defense arrangements about? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=105.92s)]
*  Well, John, they're going to make announcements to talk about strategic partnerships, about [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=110.76s)]
*  the economy, about the South China Sea. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=117.92s)]
*  And that really is what all of this hinges on. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Even though the president didn't talk at length about Beijing, it certainly was the undercurrent [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=124.2s)]
*  and the backdrop of both today's meeting and tomorrow's trilateral meeting, because it's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=129.68s)]
*  all about showing a stance together. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=134.9s)]
*  It's about showing cooperation and that there is an alliance between these countries as [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  China continues to ramp up its aggression in the South China Sea, especially when it [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=143.78s)]
*  comes to the Philippines. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  There have been several physical encounters with the Chinese Coast Guard and vessels that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=150.88s)]
*  belong to the Philippines. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=156.78s)]
*  And so they want to send a message that they are essentially teammates and they are watching [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=158.16s)]
*  very closely what happens in that part of the region with China. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=163.9s)]
*  And John, I have to say the Japanese prime minister almost summed it up perfectly when [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=170.34s)]
*  he said, you know, they were talking about the conflict in Ukraine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=174.22s)]
*  He said today it could be Ukraine and tomorrow it could be the East, East Asia. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=178.18s)]
*  And so they are eyeing this very closely. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  And speaking of backdrop, we should let our viewers know that while you were giving that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=186.3s)]
*  behind you was both the Honor Guard and the president's own Marine Band, which is all [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=191.24s)]
*  there for the state dinner tonight, I would imagine that's why everybody's there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=196.4s)]
*  Let me ask you the last question, which is that there is this Nippon Steel deal to buy [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=202.0s)]
*  U.S. Steel, Japanese company. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=209.0s)]
*  Was there discussion of that? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=213.24s)]
*  It's a political... [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  The president is against that deal, we should note. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=215.74s)]
*  Was there any discussion of that in today's meeting? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, both leaders were asked directly about this and they tried to brush it off. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=222.28s)]
*  The Japanese prime minister saying that he believes the parties are still talking about [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=228.6s)]
*  it and he hopes that it will ultimately result in a union that benefits both the U.S. and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  Japan. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=239.6s)]
*  The president just said that he reaffirmed his commitment to American workers. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=240.68s)]
*  You're right in that he opposed this deal because Japan would be acquiring U.S. Steel, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=245.68s)]
*  which really has a legacy here in the United States. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=250.44s)]
*  And of course, Biden, especially candidate Biden, has pledged so much support for steel [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=253.4s)]
*  workers to stay in this country. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=260.36s)]
*  And so even though the company itself would remain headquartered in Pittsburgh, there [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=263.26s)]
*  are a lot of questions about how that might influence labor agreements, for example, and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=268.48s)]
*  how day-to-day life is for those workers. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  So surely they talked about it in public. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=276.56s)]
*  They didn't want to draw too much attention to this tension as they talked in public because [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=279.12s)]
*  you're right, John, when there is a state visit, there is a lot of diplomacy. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=284.76s)]
*  There's a lot of work behind the scenes and to your point, a lot of pomp and circumstance [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=289.8s)]
*  because of course it all ends in a fancy state dinner happening here at the White House. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=294.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=299.12s)]
*  You're lucky the U.S. Marine Corps Band will strike up and practice and you'll get to hear [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=300.24s)]
*  it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=304.52s)]
*  Weijia Zhang at the White House, thank you so much. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=305.52s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm-ZmRpn1R0&t=306.88s)]
