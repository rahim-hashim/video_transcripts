# Significance of Putin and Kim Jong Un's meeting in North Korea
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w)
*  In time, Russian President Vladimir Putin is traveling to North Korea for the first time in 24 years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=0.0s)]
*  He's meeting with the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, amid mounting international concern about the military cooperation between the two nations. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  For more on what's on the agenda, I am joined by Vitaly Shevchenko with our partners at the BBC. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=12.72s)]
*  So what can we expect the two leaders to discuss? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=17.72s)]
*  Well, there are practical and symbolic reasons for Vladimir Putin to travel to North Korea. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=20.96s)]
*  On the symbolic level, he would be keen to show to audiences at home and across the globe that, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=27.4s)]
*  look, I've got friends in places I've got countries to visit to, and all the Western efforts to isolate me, to ostracize me, they have failed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=33.4s)]
*  But on a more pragmatic level, there are reasons to believe that he would be seeking further weapons supplies from North Korea. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=44.24s)]
*  There are reasons to believe that this is something that has been happening already. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=55.36s)]
*  Satellite images have shown thousands of shipping containers traveling from North Korea to Russia, possibly with artillery shells. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=60.36s)]
*  At least that's what South Korea is saying. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  And debris found in Ukraine suggests that Russia has been using North Korean ballistic missiles. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, if it's true that North Korea has been selling weapons to Russia, it would be in breach of UN sanctions for which Russia itself had voted. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=83.12s)]
*  So there are very good reasons for both Russia and North Korea to deny engaging in such trade. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=95.4s)]
*  Now, what's in it for North Korea? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  North Korea would be interested in food supplies from Russia, energy supplies. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=105.44s)]
*  And the last time the two leaders met, which was in September in Russia, the North Korean leader visited a spaceport in Russia. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=109.88s)]
*  So this suggests that North Korea is interested in obtaining Russian space technology or missile technology. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=118.24s)]
*  We should remind people, I mean, Putin's done this appeal in China, too. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=126.44s)]
*  Should Western nations be concerned about what appears to be a strengthening alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=129.6s)]
*  Well, that's clearly Vladimir Putin's intention. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=136.67999999999998s)]
*  He's been saying for a long time that he's trying to create what he calls a multipolar world, which isn't dominated by the United States or the West. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=139.76s)]
*  But this kind of alliance, it's fairly loose at the moment, and it includes countries such as Iran, North Korea. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=150.88s)]
*  The Russian president has been really keen to involve China in this kind of block without much tangible success, it has to be said. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=160.04s)]
*  China's been quietly helping Russian efforts to defeat Ukraine. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=171.12s)]
*  But apart from that, the West should, I think, be looking at these efforts with with a quiet concern. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=177.28s)]
*  Vitaly Shevchenko, thanks for joining us. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgc595nf8w&t=189.44s)]
