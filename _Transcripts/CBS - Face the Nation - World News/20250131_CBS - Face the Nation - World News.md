# Who is set to be returned in Hamasâ€™ next hostage release?
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE)
*  Hamas is expected to release three more hostages Saturday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=0.0s)]
*  So far, 15 people have been freed as part of the ceasefire agreement with Israel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=4.04s)]
*  CBS News International reporter Haley Ott has the latest from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Haley? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=11.68s)]
*  We've had the names of the three hostages set to be released tomorrow confirmed by the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=12.68s)]
*  families. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=17.32s)]
*  The list includes Keith Siegel, who's a dual American-Israeli citizen, 65 years old and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=18.32s)]
*  originally from North Carolina. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=23.04s)]
*  Also on the list is Yarden Bebus and Ofer Calderon. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=25.52s)]
*  Now, Yarden Bebus is the husband of Shiri Bebus, who was seen in a widely circulated [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=28.52s)]
*  video being taken by militants on October 7th to Gaza with her two young children. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=33.8s)]
*  The well-being of the Bebus family has been a real point of concern here in Israel because [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=39.96s)]
*  the children are so young and because their status, whether they were still living, wasn't [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=43.78s)]
*  known. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=49.04s)]
*  And the fact that Yarden is on the list to be released tomorrow may mean that they are [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=50.04s)]
*  no longer alive. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=54.2s)]
*  Under the terms of the ceasefire deal, women, children and adults over the age of 50 were [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=55.92s)]
*  meant to be released first. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=60.32s)]
*  Yarden is none of those things. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  So the fact that he's being released tomorrow may mean that there are no more living hostages [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=63.68s)]
*  in those categories, including his family. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  Haley Ott in Tel Aviv, thank you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDXXtkm2mE&t=72.32s)]
