*  then chased and beat other men who they identified who they targeted as Israeli [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1PuMUngDhQ&t=57.96s)]
*  fans. The mayor said people were doing hit and runs on scooters over several [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1PuMUngDhQ&t=64.08s)]
*  hours. In one jarring video on social people kicked someone who appeared to be [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1PuMUngDhQ&t=69.04s)]

*  happen in a vacuum. This was the tipping point of tensions that had been rising [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1PuMUngDhQ&t=92.94s)]
*  the past 24 to 36 hours before that soccer match. Fans of that Israeli team [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1PuMUngDhQ&t=97.82s)]

*  afraid that clashes would break out between protesters and supporters of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1PuMUngDhQ&t=128.38s)]
*  Israel and that is what happened. We know now it just happened later. Now it's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1PuMUngDhQ&t=132.5s)]
*  important to note that brawls do happen at soccer matches here across Europe but [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1PuMUngDhQ&t=138.78s)]
*  ever since the Hamas terror attacks of October 7th on Israel there has been [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1PuMUngDhQ&t=144.42000000000002s)]
