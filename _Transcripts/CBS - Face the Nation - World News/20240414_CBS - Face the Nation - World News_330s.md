# Terrorist organizations have been using Middle East conflict to "inspire," Sam Vinograd says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k)
*  We're joined now by CBS News national security contributor Samantha Vinograd formerly the assistant secretary of counterterrorism at Homeland Security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=0.0s)]
*  And she served on the National Security Council in the Obama administration great to have you back Sam good to see you so [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=7.92s)]
*  We're talking about decisions that have to be made at the top of the Israeli government right now [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=15.96s)]
*  The United States and Israel are still lockstep on defense matters [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=20.36s)]
*  but [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=25.52s)]
*  We know there's this rift in terms of the choices the Prime Minister has been making lately [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=26.68s)]
*  There are sources that I speak to within the Biden administration who are concerned about the decision-making [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=33.36s)]
*  Netanyahu is taking on and sources in the region who say there's a political benefit to war [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=40.32s)]
*  Did Iran just throw Benjamin Netanyahu a lifeline at a time? He's politically embattled at home [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, I think that when we take a step back and look at how Israel views the threat of Iran [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=54.14s)]
*  This is an existential threat to the state of Israel [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=59.02s)]
*  And we cannot forget that that said having worked closely with the government of Israel while at the White House [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=61.220000000000006s)]
*  It is true the Benjamin not Netanyahu for a long time has been staking his political dominance on [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=66.68s)]
*  Existential threats to Israel and needing to remain in power [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=75.26s)]
*  So I do think that the attack against Israel last night will give Benjamin Netanyahu more to hold on to it is also [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=77.98s)]
*  true Margaret that in a moment of such uncertainty for the state of Israel [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=85.78s)]
*  Political paralysis that would arise from early elections which Netanyahu's largest rival Benny Gantz called for that early elections [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=90.46000000000001s)]
*  Would create a state of political uncertainty at a time when all resources from Benjamin Netanyahu on down [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=97.98s)]
*  Do need to be focused on? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  countering Iran [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  Gantz has said those would be in September so early but not in the middle of the war essentially [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=108.3s)]
*  But we'll see what happens and how many wars exist potentially right in the coming months. This is so on edge. I [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=113.97999999999999s)]
*  Know that in our own polling we see that half of this country believes the threat of terrorism will increase not just for Israel [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  But also for the US because of this ongoing Israeli war with Hamas in Gaza [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=129.78s)]
*  The FBI director testified this week saying the number of investigations have escalated since October 7th [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=135.39999999999998s)]
*  These are self radicalized people. How should Americans at home? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=142.11999999999998s)]
*  Understand this threat domestically. Well, let's keep in mind what happens overseas [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  Often doesn't stay overseas from a counterterrorism perspective. I was in the room after October 7th [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=152.64s)]
*  I can tell you that the administration has been deeply focused on really ensuring two things [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=158.48s)]
*  One that foreign terrorists don't seek to travel to the homeland to inflict damage here [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=163.04s)]
*  But more importantly, we know factually speaking that terrorist groups and Iran who's the largest state sponsor of terror in the world [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=168.04s)]
*  Uses these kinds of high-profile events like what we saw last night as mass marketing opportunities [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=176.2s)]
*  Iran's attack against Israel is a mass marketing opportunity from Iran and its proxies to try to radicalize supporters [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  We know that terrorist organizations have been using the Israel Hamas conflict to try to inspire [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  Supporters and operatives all around the world to act primarily against places of worship [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=196.16s)]
*  Entities believed to be associated with the state of Israel and that's why I don't believe that there's a homeland [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  Security nexus to what unfolded last night in the homeland at this time based on the sources that I've been speaking with however [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=208.4s)]
*  Out an abundance of caution the federal government state and local partners are taking every step possible to ensure that nothing reverberates here [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=215.0s)]
*  We saw the Homeland Security advisor in the meeting with the president secretary Blinken secretary Austin and others last night [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=223.08s)]
*  We have seen the New York Police Department LA Police Department and others indicate that they are increasing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=229.24s)]
*  patrols around places of worship and what we need right now is for law enforcement and intelligence partners to remain vigilant and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=235.08s)]
*  For members of the community to speak up if they see anything suspicious because the biggest [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  International terrorism threat facing the homeland right now is individuals inspired by what they're seeing overseas to action and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  We know I mean the director of national intelligence has testified that the Israeli war in Gaza will have a generational impact [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=255.76s)]
*  potentially on terrorism and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=263.0s)]
*  We're seeing in our polling support for Israel's war. They are dropping [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=265.4s)]
*  How concerned are your former colleagues that Israel is losing strategically the fight and becoming more isolated? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=271.34s)]
*  From a counterterrorism perspective [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=279.02s)]
*  It is a fact that what is happening in Gaza is being used again as a mass marketing opportunity [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=281.02s)]
*  not only because the suffering is [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=286.58s)]
*  Incredibly difficult for anyone to watch Hamas and other Iranian proxies are using those images to try to rally support [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=289.58s)]
*  Against Israel whether it be here in the homeland or more broadly across the world [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=296.82s)]
*  I think the biggest concern right now is ensuring that Israel has what its needs to deter Iran not just today [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=300.78s)]
*  But going forward and so when we think about what Israel's next move is going to be we also have to think about what the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=306.65999999999997s)]
*  International community is going to do to ensure that Iran loses the funding to for its ballistic and cruise missile program and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  Tries to take us or takes a step back from funding terrorism around the world [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=320.58s)]
*  We'll see what that international response is at the UN and elsewhere Sam. Thank you very much for your analysis [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbc4GrpA9k&t=324.3s)]
