# White House officials discuss Israel-Hamas war, hostage situation | full video
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM)
*  on the situation in Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=0.0s)]
*  Go ahead, John. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=4.36s)]
*  Appreciate that. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=4.86s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  As Kareem noted, sadly, the numbers of Americans killed, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=12.72s)]
*  murdered, has climbed. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=18.52s)]
*  And we have a little bit better sense today [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=21.44s)]
*  of how many more Americans are unaccounted for or missing. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=24.0s)]
*  We know that a number of those Americans [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=29.68s)]
*  are being held hostage right now by Hamas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=34.16s)]
*  I think we all need to steel ourselves [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=37.8s)]
*  for the very distinct possibility [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=39.44s)]
*  that these numbers will keep increasing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=41.96s)]
*  and that we may, in fact, find out that more Americans are [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=44.68s)]
*  part of the hostage pool. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=49.6s)]
*  So as Kareem said, our message to all these families affected [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=52.6s)]
*  is that we're with you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=55.44s)]
*  We're grieving with you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=56.68s)]
*  We're sorrowful with you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=57.92s)]
*  We're worrying with you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=59.92s)]
*  And we're going to do everything we can, particularly [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  for those who don't know where a loved one is, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  to find out where they are and to get them home with you [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  where they belong. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  And that includes, of course, being [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  willing to assist in advice or counsel when it comes [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=73.68s)]
*  to hostage recovery efforts. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=77.64s)]
*  Now, of course, the Israelis have a very robust hostage [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=78.84s)]
*  recovery capability of their own. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=81.72s)]
*  Sadly, they have been forced to perfect [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=84.16s)]
*  that particular kind of capability. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=86.48s)]
*  But we also have a lot of know-how, too. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  And we're offering to share that with the Israeli Defense [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=89.72s)]
*  Forces. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  At the same time, we're sharing additional defense-related [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  support. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=97.28s)]
*  I think you saw that the Israeli military announced today [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  with some imagery the first tranche of US military [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=102.56s)]
*  assistance arriving in Israel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  That will continue. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=108.2s)]
*  We also, as I think the president alluded to yesterday, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  were able to replenish some of their Iron Dome interceptor [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=113.48s)]
*  missiles. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=117.56s)]
*  These were missiles that we already had in stock in Israel. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  We simply just transferred ownership over [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=121.56s)]
*  to the Israeli Defense Forces. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=123.72s)]
*  So again, more aid, more assistance [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=125.72s)]
*  will be coming in coming days. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  As you also know, the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=131.6s)]
*  and her strike group are now in the eastern Mediterranean. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=136.12s)]
*  They arrived yesterday. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  They are there for deterrence purposes [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=140.8s)]
*  to make it clear to any would-be actor, organization, group, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=143.12s)]
*  terrorist network, nation state, anybody [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=146.68s)]
*  who thinks that with hostile intent towards Israel [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=149.12s)]
*  that this is the time to widen and expand the conflict, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=151.72s)]
*  that we will take our national security interests seriously. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=154.72s)]
*  I would also note that the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, aircraft [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=157.36s)]
*  carrier, and her strike group will [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=161.24s)]
*  be departing on a pre-scheduled, long-scheduled deployment [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=162.72s)]
*  to the European command area of responsibility. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=167.0s)]
*  They'll start that deployment in the coming week or so. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=169.48s)]
*  They will be going initially across the Atlantic [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=173.32s)]
*  and into the Mediterranean, where they will be available [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=175.84s)]
*  if needed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=178.32s)]
*  No decisions have been made. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  I've seen some press reporting out there [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  that we've already made some kind of final decision [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  that a second carrier is going to be placed in the eastern Med. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=184.64s)]
*  No operational decisions like that have been made. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=187.44s)]
*  But she will be heading in that direction. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  Her ships will be with her. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  And she certainly will be an available asset if needed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=193.12s)]
*  Bottom line is, as I said, we're sending [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  a loud and clear message. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=198.84s)]
*  The United States is ready to take action [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=199.88s)]
*  should any actor hostile to Israel [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  consider trying to escalate or widen this war. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=203.32s)]
*  And I think Jake said that pretty well yesterday. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  We're also going to continue to talk to our Israeli partners [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=208.4s)]
*  about their needs to ensure, again, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=210.76s)]
*  that they have what they require to defend [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=212.8s)]
*  their country and their people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=214.84s)]
*  And that's just not going to stop. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=216.32s)]
*  In fact, it's almost an hourly conversation [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=217.66s)]
*  that we're having with our counterparts. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, I know many of you have been asking about or expressing [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=221.56s)]
*  some interest in the idea of safe passage [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=225.4s)]
*  in Gaza for civilians. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=227.08s)]
*  Let me just say right up front, we're actively [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  discussing this with our Israeli and our Egyptian counterparts. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=230.16s)]
*  We support safe passage for civilians. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  Civilians are not to blame for what Hamas has done. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=236.2s)]
*  They didn't do anything wrong. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=239.04s)]
*  And we continue to support safe passage. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=240.32s)]
*  I don't have an announcement to make today. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=242.04s)]
*  I can't tell you a specific route or a corridor. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  I just want to make it clear that we are actively [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=245.92s)]
*  working on this with our Egyptian and our Israeli [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=247.92s)]
*  counterparts. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=251.16s)]
*  Civilians are protected under the laws of armed conflict. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  And they should be given every opportunity [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  to avoid the fighting. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, if I could switch to Ukraine just quickly. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=260.16s)]
*  Today, the Secretary of Defense announced at the Ukraine [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=262.88s)]
*  Defense Contact Group meeting over in Europe [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=265.72s)]
*  that the United States is announcing a new aid package, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=268.2s)]
*  which includes air defense munitions, ammunition, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=270.72s)]
*  for US-provided artillery, and HIMARS counter, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=273.8s)]
*  UAS equipment, unmanned aerial systems, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=277.76s)]
*  sorry, to help Ukraine protect their people [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=280.0s)]
*  against Russian and Iranian drone strikes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=282.44s)]
*  We're also announcing additional anti-armor capabilities [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=285.16s)]
*  and more than 16 million rounds of small arms and ammunition. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  As Ukrainians continue to wage a very tough counteroffensive [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=291.48s)]
*  and as winter now fast approaches, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  we believe that it is absolutely imperative, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=296.76000000000005s)]
*  you heard me say before, time is not our friend, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  that we continue to do everything [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=300.88000000000005s)]
*  we can to help Ukraine succeed on the battlefield [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=302.32000000000005s)]
*  and claw back some more of their own territory [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=304.76000000000005s)]
*  from Russian units on the ground there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=306.88s)]
*  This military aid package that we're announcing today [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=310.32000000000005s)]
*  is another important signal of our continued commitment [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=313.04s)]
*  to supporting the Ukrainian people, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=316.08s)]
*  and it utilizes funding authorities [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=318.16s)]
*  that Congress authorized for Ukraine [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=320.26s)]
*  during a prior fiscal year [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=321.8s)]
*  under the presidential drawdown authority. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=324.36s)]
*  We're obviously going to continue to provide Ukraine [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=326.32s)]
*  with the weapons and equipment they need, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=328.92s)]
*  but it is absolutely critical that Congress [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=330.84s)]
*  keep its commitment to the people of Ukraine [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=333.04s)]
*  by providing additional funding. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=335.08s)]
*  We are in active conversations with members of Congress [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=337.24s)]
*  about additional funding for Ukraine and for Israel, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=339.92s)]
*  and it's critical again that we believe Congress [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=344.04s)]
*  sends a clear message to Putin, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=346.12s)]
*  sends a clear message to the Israeli people [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=348.24s)]
*  that the United States continues to have their back. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=351.12s)]
*  With that, we take some questions. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=353.92s)]
*  The Press. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  John, just a little bit of clarification [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=357.44s)]
*  on the 22 Americans who have unfortunately been killed. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=359.76s)]
*  Were all those Americans killed, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=363.76s)]
*  believed to be killed by Hamas, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=365.90000000000003s)]
*  were all of them all killed in Israeli territory? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=367.92s)]
*  Or do we know, do you know how many Americans [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  have been killed inside Gaza? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm afraid I don't. I mean, we know the number is accurate [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=377.0s)]
*  as of right now, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=379.88s)]
*  but this individual circumstances are not exactly clear. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=380.88s)]
*  The Press. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=384.64s)]
*  This group of 22, it was in Israel, but — [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=385.56s)]
*  I don't have the details on every single one. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=390.32s)]
*  You could certainly consult the State Department. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=392.6s)]
*  They might have a little bit higher touch [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=395.20000000000005s)]
*  because they're in touch or I know they're trying to be [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=396.92s)]
*  in touch with all the families, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=399.0s)]
*  but we don't have that information. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=399.96000000000004s)]
*  The Press. I can just quickly — [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=401.64000000000004s)]
*  all signs suggest that Israel will begin possible [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  ground invasion relatively soon. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=406.92s)]
*  I know you talked about safe passage, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  but has the U.S. done anything to dissuade Israel [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=411.72s)]
*  from moving ahead with a ground offensive? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=416.84000000000003s)]
*  And if it does move ahead, has the President [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=420.44s)]
*  or administration officials directly asked Israel [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=423.72s)]
*  to show strength in how it goes and how it's such an operation? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=426.68s)]
*  We're going to let the Israelis talk about their military operations, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=431.16s)]
*  particularly in the future tense. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=435.04s)]
*  I mean, we don't even talk about our operations in the future tense, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=436.88s)]
*  so I don't want to get ahead of where things are, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=440.32s)]
*  and I certainly am not going to talk about Israeli military planning, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=443.6s)]
*  so I'll let them take that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=446.8s)]
*  You heard the President talk about this a little bit yesterday, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=449.16s)]
*  this idea of you're asking about restraint. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, nobody wants to see any more innocent life lost. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=455.36s)]
*  None. Nobody, no matter who you are. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=459.68s)]
*  If you're an innocent civilian, you didn't cause this, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=463.44s)]
*  you didn't ask for this, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  and you shouldn't be having to fear for your life. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=467.16s)]
*  Nobody wants to see that happen. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=469.6s)]
*  And I think it's important to remind that, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=471.88s)]
*  especially on the Palestinian side, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=475.32s)]
*  Hamas is directly endangering their lives, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=478.32s)]
*  headquartering themselves in hospitals and schools, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=481.44s)]
*  residential buildings, using the Palestinian people as human shields. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=483.84s)]
*  They didn't ask for that either. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=487.67999999999995s)]
*  And Hamas doesn't speak for the majority of the Palestinian people [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=488.91999999999996s)]
*  or their aspirations for peace and security. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=491.64s)]
*  I think that's an important place to start this conversation. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=493.88s)]
*  Unlike the United States, unlike Israel, as the President said yesterday, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=497.0s)]
*  who have respect for the rule of law and the law of armed conflict [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=502.44s)]
*  and respect for human life, Hamas has none. None at all. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=506.44s)]
*  So, again, we'll let the Israelis speak for their military operations. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=510.32s)]
*  Our focus squarely right now, and these still early hours, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=515.68s)]
*  and they are early hours, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=519.2s)]
*  is to make sure that the Israelis have what they need. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=520.6s)]
*  I just want to clarify the numbers here. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  I think, Corinne, you just said that 17 Americans remain missing. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=526.0s)]
*  Is that the latest number? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=528.92s)]
*  I think yesterday you had said 20. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=530.04s)]
*  I just want to make sure we're operating off of the same thing. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=531.36s)]
*  There is 17 that are missing and 22 that are dead. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=534.36s)]
*  And is there anything you can share with us [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=540.24s)]
*  about anything you know about the condition of the hostages? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=542.44s)]
*  And also, has there been any kind of communication with Hamas, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=544.84s)]
*  either directly or with our allies or partners, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=548.08s)]
*  about securing their release? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=550.76s)]
*  Is there any kind of receptiveness [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=552.32s)]
*  that they've shown even to talking about this issue? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=554.84s)]
*  So, let me take the second one first. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=556.96s)]
*  Obviously, we're in discussions not only with the Israelis [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=559.44s)]
*  about what hostage recovery could look like, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  but with other allies and partners in the region. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=566.6s)]
*  And there are some countries, like Qatar, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=568.84s)]
*  that have open lines of communication with Hamas. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=570.6s)]
*  So, of course, we're casting the net wide, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=574.88s)]
*  as you would expect we would. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=577.1600000000001s)]
*  We want to get these, all the hostages back with their families, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=578.1600000000001s)]
*  particularly the American hostages. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  No question about that. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=582.84s)]
*  Now, where they are and in what condition? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  No. Sadly, we don't know. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=588.44s)]
*  And that makes efforts very, very difficult, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=591.12s)]
*  again, in these early hours. But we don't know. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=593.6s)]
*  We don't know where they are. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=595.48s)]
*  We don't know if they're all in one group [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=596.1600000000001s)]
*  or broken up into several groups. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  We don't know if they're being moved [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=599.1999999999999s)]
*  and with what frequency and to what locations. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=600.4s)]
*  All of those questions we're working hard to answer. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=603.12s)]
*  I understand you're casting a wide net, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=606.04s)]
*  but has any communication actually been made with Hamas? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to leave the answer the way I gave it to you. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=611.16s)]
*  I think just like in any other case [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=615.36s)]
*  when we're talking about getting Americans home overseas [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=616.84s)]
*  that have been held hostage or wrongfully detained, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=619.92s)]
*  the less you say out there publicly, the better. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=621.68s)]
*  Go ahead, Ed. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=623.64s)]
*  Thank you. And two on this region [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=624.4399999999999s)]
*  and one on another in this hemisphere [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=625.92s)]
*  that I know some outlets in this room have questions about. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=627.76s)]
*  First, on the humanitarian corridor, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=631.16s)]
*  is it accurate that the Egyptians have rejected calls [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  to allow for one? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=638.4799999999999s)]
*  I think you'd have to talk to the Egyptian authorities on that. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=640.0s)]
*  Do the talks continue or ... [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=642.04s)]
*  We believe that safe passage is important, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=644.1999999999999s)]
*  and we want to see safe passage, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=647.16s)]
*  a safe passage corridor opened up. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  We also believe it's important that humanitarian assistance [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=651.0s)]
*  have a way to continue to get to the Palestinian people. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=653.4000000000001s)]
*  And as Jake mentioned yesterday, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=656.0s)]
*  we're in active discussions with the Israelis [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=657.72s)]
*  and with the Egyptians about that. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=660.6400000000001s)]
*  There's, of course, this ongoing intelligence assessment [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=663.72s)]
*  and now political debate over Iran, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=667.84s)]
*  what it knew, what it may have done to support Hamas [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=669.88s)]
*  in all of this. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=673.48s)]
*  Even if there's no direct evidence [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=674.9200000000001s)]
*  linking Iran to this specific attack right now, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=676.36s)]
*  does the U.S. believe Iran needs to pay some kind of a price [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=680.12s)]
*  or need some kind of retribution [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=683.48s)]
*  for having supported Hamas all along up to this point? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=686.12s)]
*  I mean, the question almost ... [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=689.88s)]
*  And I'm not picking on you, Ed, but it implies [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=690.92s)]
*  that we're just now waking up to the fact [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=693.64s)]
*  that they've been supporting Hamas and Hezbollah [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=695.28s)]
*  and other terrorist networks. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=697.64s)]
*  Hamas is one of the most highly sanctioned terrorist networks [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=699.76s)]
*  on the planet, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=702.6s)]
*  largely because of what we've been doing here [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=703.8399999999999s)]
*  in the United States to target them. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  In Iran, my goodness, just since the beginning [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=707.52s)]
*  of this administration, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  we have sanctioned some 400-plus entities [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=710.3199999999999s)]
*  with more than 40 different sets of sanctioned regimes, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=713.72s)]
*  30 of those just this past year alone. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=717.48s)]
*  We've increased our military presence in the Gulf region [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=721.6s)]
*  because of their attacks on maritime shipping. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=724.4s)]
*  We have added additional sanctions [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=726.4399999999999s)]
*  because of their support to Russia [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=728.56s)]
*  and the fact that they're still providing drones [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=729.8s)]
*  and technology to Mr. Putin [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=731.68s)]
*  so he can kill innocent Ukrainians. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=733.72s)]
*  And now we've added our military capability. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=735.4399999999999s)]
*  We've added to it from a naval perspective [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=737.3199999999999s)]
*  in the eastern med. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=739.56s)]
*  So nobody has turned a blind eye [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=740.36s)]
*  to Iranian destabilizing behavior. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=742.84s)]
*  Now, I think what you're trying to get at [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=745.24s)]
*  is this particular set of attacks. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=747.56s)]
*  What Jake said yesterday still holds. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=749.76s)]
*  We obviously recognize that there's broad complicity [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=751.72s)]
*  here by the Iranians. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=754.16s)]
*  I mean, because of the longstanding support to Hamas. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=755.0799999999999s)]
*  Hamas wouldn't have been able to function at all [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=757.72s)]
*  had it not been for propping up by the Iranian regime, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=759.8s)]
*  but we haven't seen any specific evidence [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=762.76s)]
*  that tells us they were witting, involved in the planning, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=765.72s)]
*  or involved in the resourcing and the training [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=770.3199999999999s)]
*  that went into this very complex set of attacks [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=773.48s)]
*  over the weekend. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=775.92s)]
*  There's one other, like I mentioned, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=776.6s)]
*  an issue here in this hemisphere [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=778.72s)]
*  that there are outlets in this room [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=779.88s)]
*  I know are curious about. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=781.4399999999999s)]
*  There have been several days now of protest in Guatemala [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=783.16s)]
*  that have essentially locked down parts of the country [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=786.16s)]
*  and that the ongoing protracted, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=788.36s)]
*  difficult presidential transition. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=791.28s)]
*  Just curious if you can give us a sense [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=793.28s)]
*  of how the U.S. is monitoring that [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=794.8s)]
*  and whether it has any message for protesters [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=797.28s)]
*  who continue to hold up some parts of society [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=799.04s)]
*  that have blocked gasoline and food shipments [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=801.72s)]
*  to parts of the country. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=804.68s)]
*  We certainly aren't going to involve ourselves [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=805.52s)]
*  in internal Guatemalan politics. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=806.9599999999999s)]
*  We obviously believe in free and fair elections. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=809.0s)]
*  We believe in democratic voices, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=810.9599999999999s)]
*  and we certainly believe in the right of peaceful protest. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=813.8s)]
*  People should have the right to protest, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=816.8s)]
*  whatever they want to do, as long as they do it peacefully. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=818.92s)]
*  And in a way that doesn't put others at harm. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=821.6s)]
*  I think I'll leave it at that. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=824.0400000000001s)]
*  Go ahead, Jeff. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=824.9200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  John, you mentioned wanting to avoid actors [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=827.44s)]
*  in the region taking advantage of this. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=830.48s)]
*  Can you give us a sense of who you think [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=833.12s)]
*  might take advantage of this that you're worried about? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=835.5200000000001s)]
*  I think there's a unfortunately long list of actors [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=837.88s)]
*  in the region that are hostile to Israel. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=842.9200000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah is one of them. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=844.6s)]
*  And we've been watching with concern [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=845.6800000000001s)]
*  some of the rocket attacks that have come across [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=850.52s)]
*  the northern border of Israel from Lebanon, which obviously [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=854.36s)]
*  were coming from Hezbollah. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=857.56s)]
*  So we're clearly concerned about that. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=858.88s)]
*  Concerned about Iran as well? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=860.92s)]
*  We're always concerned about Iran. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=862.28s)]
*  And Iran's hostility to Israel doesn't [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=863.72s)]
*  need any reaffirmation by us. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=867.3199999999999s)]
*  It's out there playing to see. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=870.68s)]
*  So yeah, of course we're concerned about Iran. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=872.1999999999999s)]
*  You mentioned the humanitarian corridor, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=873.92s)]
*  but more just staying on the topic of the humanitarian issue. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=875.6s)]
*  What can be done, or what is the US [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=880.4s)]
*  doing to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=881.92s)]
*  the situation now about power, water, food? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=885.16s)]
*  Yeah, as I said, we believe that humanitarian assistance [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=888.36s)]
*  is important for the Palestinian people that live in Gaza. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=891.48s)]
*  And we are going to continue to pursue options [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=894.48s)]
*  to make sure that they get that humanitarian assistance. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=897.96s)]
*  Yeah, is the US in conversation with the Palestinian authority [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=902.6s)]
*  or the Palestinian community here in the US? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=906.84s)]
*  We have been routinely in communication [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=909.48s)]
*  with the Palestinian authority. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't have or I don't, there's not meetings or discussions [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=913.84s)]
*  in recent hours that I can speak to. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=918.6800000000001s)]
*  But we have long maintained an open line [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=921.16s)]
*  of communication with them. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=922.84s)]
*  How about, does the US also condemn perhaps [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=924.04s)]
*  potential war crimes, Israelis are committing against Gaza? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=928.08s)]
*  Our focus right now is making sure [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=934.5600000000001s)]
*  that Israel has what it needs to defend itself [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=936.08s)]
*  against these attacks. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=938.36s)]
*  If I could ask you first just about something [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=941.2s)]
*  that you referred to, which is the reported incursion [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=942.5600000000001s)]
*  into northern Israel. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=944.76s)]
*  There have been reports from the IDF. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=946.48s)]
*  Do you have any new information to share on that? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=947.96s)]
*  There were reports of paragliders initially. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=949.88s)]
*  Any other additional information about that? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=952.12s)]
*  I've seen the reports. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=954.08s)]
*  We've taken a quick look at them. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=955.12s)]
*  We are not in a position to corroborate [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=957.32s)]
*  the validity of them. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=959.36s)]
*  What I've talked about with Jeff was rocket attacks [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=960.96s)]
*  that we know have occurred in recent days. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=963.12s)]
*  Then if I can, I just want to ask you separately [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=964.96s)]
*  about these hostages right now. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=967.12s)]
*  Presumably 22 dead, at least 17 held hostage. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=968.48s)]
*  Not only the number of dead could rise. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  17 that we know are missing. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=973.5600000000001s)]
*  And that number will fluctuate. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=976.2s)]
*  It could rise, it could go down. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=978.12s)]
*  I mean, as people may be, they're found safe and sound. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=979.4000000000001s)]
*  So it's 17 today. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=981.8000000000001s)]
*  So about those who remain hostages right now, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=983.76s)]
*  has the President ruled out sending any American forces [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=987.0s)]
*  of any kind into Gaza at any time [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=990.84s)]
*  to help secure their release if necessary to get them out safely? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=993.24s)]
*  We haven't made any policy options [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=995.84s)]
*  or operational decisions with respect [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=997.52s)]
*  to hostage recovery at this time. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=999.2800000000001s)]
*  We are active. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1001.64s)]
*  We haven't made any decisions about hostage recovery [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1003.0s)]
*  at this time. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1005.76s)]
*  We just don't also have enough information, Peter, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1006.2800000000001s)]
*  to be able to make decisions like that. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1009.36s)]
*  But you heard Jake yesterday say, and the President has said, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1012.4s)]
*  we'll do everything we can anywhere around the world [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1016.84s)]
*  to make sure that Americans held hostage have a path home [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1020.2800000000001s)]
*  and to be safe with their families. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1024.0s)]
*  So we're keeping the marriage question. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1025.4s)]
*  Obviously, we're casting the wide net. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1028.8000000000002s)]
*  We're also keeping the options wide open right now [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1030.3600000000001s)]
*  as we get more information. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1033.0s)]
*  But we just don't have enough granularity [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1034.24s)]
*  to be able to fine tune those options. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1037.44s)]
*  Has the President spoken to any of those unaccounted for [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1039.72s)]
*  or any of those Americans dead? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1042.1200000000001s)]
*  I know that the State Department has [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1045.4s)]
*  been in touch with many, most of the families of those [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1046.8000000000002s)]
*  that we know have been killed. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1051.24s)]
*  I don't know if they've talked to all of them. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1052.8000000000002s)]
*  I have no conversations from the White House to speak to. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1054.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1056.76s)]
*  What's the level of concern that American troops who [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1057.6799999999998s)]
*  are stationed in the Middle East might [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1060.28s)]
*  be a target of Iran or some proxy forces? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1062.04s)]
*  And are there steps being taken to secure military installations? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1065.08s)]
*  Well, sadly, I mean, our troops in the Middle East [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1069.48s)]
*  are well familiar with the ebb and flow of security concerns [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1073.6399999999999s)]
*  for force protection. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1078.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's just part and parcel being deployed there. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1079.6799999999998s)]
*  And it's never not a concern for commanders in the region [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1083.0s)]
*  when it comes to force protection, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1087.52s)]
*  because some other event somewhere else could absolutely [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1089.2s)]
*  have repercussions for you and your troops. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1092.28s)]
*  So without speaking to specifics, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1094.08s)]
*  never do that with the force protection measures look like. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1096.32s)]
*  They change all the time. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1098.76s)]
*  They certainly are adapted to the situation. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1100.12s)]
*  And the Defense Department will, and of course, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1102.52s)]
*  be able to speak to what they're doing. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1107.44s)]
*  And are you seeing any evidence of potential domestic threats [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1110.44s)]
*  that people might be inspired by these attacks [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1113.12s)]
*  to do harm here in the US to synagogues or any of these? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1116.24s)]
*  I know of no specific threats here domestically [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1120.12s)]
*  based on a spillover effect of what's [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1124.28s)]
*  happening between Israel and Hamas. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1126.76s)]
*  I know of no specific threat streams here to speak to. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1130.08s)]
*  But you heard the president talk about this yesterday. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1133.56s)]
*  We're not going to assume anything. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1136.6s)]
*  Because of the rise of anti-Semitism around the world [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1138.76s)]
*  and certainly here at home, it makes perfect, prudent sense [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1140.96s)]
*  that we take the kind of action we have taken with local and [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1143.92s)]
*  state authorities to increase our intelligence posture, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1146.32s)]
*  domestic intelligence posture, and to make sure [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1150.08s)]
*  that we're properly prepared to deter and disrupt [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1152.44s)]
*  any potential violent threat to the Jewish community [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1155.68s)]
*  here at home. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1159.04s)]
*  And I think you'll hear the president talk about this [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1159.76s)]
*  a little bit more today. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1161.36s)]
*  Jackie, in the room over there. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1162.48s)]
*  Thank you, Kareem. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1163.6s)]
*  John, this was a massive intelligence failure. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1164.52s)]
*  Who bears responsibility for that? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1168.04s)]
*  You know something, Jackie? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1169.92s)]
*  There's going to come a time when it's appropriate for us [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1170.96s)]
*  to take a look back retrospectively [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1173.52s)]
*  and see what the intel picture showed us or didn't show us, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1177.3999999999999s)]
*  whether there's any gaps that need to be closed. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1180.8s)]
*  There's going to be a time for that. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1183.04s)]
*  And I suspect that our Israeli counterparts will [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1184.52s)]
*  do the same thing. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1186.92s)]
*  Now is not that time. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1187.68s)]
*  It's just not that time. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1189.08s)]
*  Can you speak to the reports that Israel [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1190.1599999999999s)]
*  was warned by Egypt? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1192.52s)]
*  I can't. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1194.0s)]
*  Michael from Foreign Affairs made that allegation [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1194.92s)]
*  this morning saying that that was something [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1197.44s)]
*  that members were told on the Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1200.16s)]
*  So has that been discussed at all, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1205.1200000000001s)]
*  or is that something you're looking into? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1208.6000000000001s)]
*  I can't speak to specific intelligence matters. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1210.6000000000001s)]
*  Again, there will be a time to look back at this, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1212.7600000000002s)]
*  as we always do, and we will. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1215.3600000000001s)]
*  Right now, we're sharpening the intelligence [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1217.0400000000002s)]
*  gathering and cooperation and sharing with Israel, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1218.88s)]
*  as we should, since they're involved in active operations. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1221.1200000000001s)]
*  And we're making sure that they get the tools they need. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1224.48s)]
*  Can you define what the direct link is, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1226.92s)]
*  when you guys talk about Iran not being involved, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1229.0s)]
*  no direct link? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1231.72s)]
*  What do you consider to be a direct link? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1232.56s)]
*  So what I'm referring to there is any evidence [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1235.48s)]
*  that we have that they were knowledgeable of and aware [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1240.6s)]
*  of these particular attacks. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1246.8s)]
*  Now, of course, as Jake said yesterday, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1250.72s)]
*  that they obviously have been broadly [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1254.36s)]
*  aware of Hamas's hostility to Israel [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1258.12s)]
*  and to some of the broad planning that Hamas would do. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1262.8799999999999s)]
*  But we haven't seen anything that tells us [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1268.08s)]
*  they knew specifically date, time, method, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1270.36s)]
*  that they were witting to this. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1274.08s)]
*  We haven't seen anything that tells us they specifically [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1278.12s)]
*  cut checks to support this set of attacks [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1280.76s)]
*  or that they were involved in the training. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1284.08s)]
*  And obviously, this required quite a bit of training [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1286.28s)]
*  by these terrorists or that they were involved [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1288.48s)]
*  in any directing of the operation. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1292.24s)]
*  So again, I'll get to your I promise I'm not trying [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1295.1599999999999s)]
*  to monopolize the time here. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1299.84s)]
*  But we're not one and done here either. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1302.28s)]
*  We're going to continue to look at the intelligence stream [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1306.32s)]
*  and see if it leads us to a different conclusion. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1309.08s)]
*  All I can do is be honest with you about the conclusions we're [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1311.1999999999998s)]
*  today, and we just haven't seen that. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1314.0600000000002s)]
*  You kind of answered my follow up, which is, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1315.74s)]
*  is it the position of the administration [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1318.0600000000002s)]
*  that at this stage Iran was not involved? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1320.9s)]
*  I guess my question is, how can we [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1323.8200000000002s)]
*  know this was in the planning for over a year [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1326.02s)]
*  and within a few short days say that Iran was not behind it? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1328.38s)]
*  Because that's what we think. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1333.78s)]
*  Because we've been looking at it. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1335.94s)]
*  It is the position then? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1337.5800000000002s)]
*  You know, what we think now. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1338.6200000000001s)]
*  Again, we have not seen any evidence, specific evidence, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1340.86s)]
*  that Iran was directly involved with these specific sets [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1345.8999999999999s)]
*  of attacks. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1349.26s)]
*  That doesn't mean that, yeah, I mean, look, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1350.3799999999999s)]
*  we're going to keep looking at it. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1352.26s)]
*  The book's not closed on it. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1353.9399999999998s)]
*  We're going to keep looking at that. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1355.6999999999998s)]
*  But that's just where we are right now. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1357.3s)]
*  All right, we're going to move on. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1359.3s)]
*  Go ahead, Anita. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1360.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry to yammer on the Iran thing, but just briefly, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1360.86s)]
*  what did Iran know and when did they know it? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1364.9799999999998s)]
*  Where are we now? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1369.2199999999998s)]
*  Where is the White House now and what [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1370.06s)]
*  they knew when they knew it about this attack? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1371.58s)]
*  I think I'd give you the same answer I gave Jackie. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1374.8999999999999s)]
*  Moving on to China, the foreign minister [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1378.1399999999999s)]
*  is coming to DC soon. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1380.22s)]
*  I'm just wondering if you can preview [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1381.82s)]
*  what's on the agenda, who he's meeting with, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1383.36s)]
*  and then let us know what the prospects are for a Xi-Biden [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1385.4199999999998s)]
*  meeting and whether that might be at APEC in November. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1389.5s)]
*  I think we'll have more to say about the specific agenda [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1392.46s)]
*  as we get closer to it. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1395.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't have any of the details for you. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1396.34s)]
*  And I don't have anything to announce or speak [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1398.38s)]
*  to with respect to a meeting between President Biden [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1400.8200000000002s)]
*  and President Xi. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1402.94s)]
*  Go ahead, Nadia. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1403.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1404.66s)]
*  John, I'm here. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1405.5800000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1406.8200000000002s)]
*  Yesterday, I saw heart-wrenching stories [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1408.14s)]
*  of testimonies of Israeli families [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1411.0600000000002s)]
*  who lost their loved one, similar to the one that [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1413.1000000000001s)]
*  made you tear up on TV. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1415.98s)]
*  One of them is the story of Haim Katzmann. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1419.18s)]
*  His sister appeared to the Israeli government, who [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1422.46s)]
*  is a peace activist. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1425.14s)]
*  She's asking the Israeli government [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1426.62s)]
*  not to kill civilians in Gaza in his name. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1427.9399999999998s)]
*  Is this a message that you encourage and you carry [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1430.62s)]
*  to your Israeli partners? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1433.1799999999998s)]
*  Considering that today we have 11 UN workers who [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1435.1799999999998s)]
*  have been killed, four journalists, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1438.1s)]
*  and 1,100 civilians, how can you make sure [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1440.1799999999998s)]
*  that these people are not collateral damage? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1443.26s)]
*  I've kind of addressed this before, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1445.54s)]
*  but I'm happy to revisit it quickly. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1447.1399999999999s)]
*  Again, we don't want to see any more innocent civilian life [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1448.7399999999998s)]
*  taken or lost. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1452.1399999999999s)]
*  None. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1454.58s)]
*  I mean, the number should be zero of innocent civilians [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1455.54s)]
*  killed or harmed right now. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1460.18s)]
*  Sadly, that's not the case. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1462.6599999999999s)]
*  And I can't stand here. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1465.02s)]
*  I wouldn't stand here before you and try [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1468.86s)]
*  to predict that in a war, which is still raging [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1472.46s)]
*  and may rage for yet some time, that there [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1477.34s)]
*  won't be additional civilian casualties. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1480.6599999999999s)]
*  I wish I could promise you that's not [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1483.26s)]
*  going to be the case, but I can't. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1484.82s)]
*  We don't want to see any more, but I can't promise that. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1487.1799999999998s)]
*  All I can do is repeat what the president said, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1490.3s)]
*  that this is what differentiates modern democracies [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1493.5s)]
*  like Israel and the United States from Hamas. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1498.74s)]
*  Hamas is deliberately, I mean, the whole purpose [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1500.54s)]
*  of the initial attacks on Saturday [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1504.74s)]
*  were to kill, to murder, to butcher, to slaughter. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1506.4199999999998s)]
*  They weren't trying to occupy territory. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1510.1s)]
*  They were trying to kill. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1513.06s)]
*  And they are the ones placing the Palestinians at greater [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1515.1s)]
*  risk by headquartering themselves [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1517.6599999999999s)]
*  in hospitals and schools. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1519.5s)]
*  OK, Brian. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1520.6599999999999s)]
*  Brian. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1521.3799999999999s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1522.22s)]
*  Hey, John. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1522.78s)]
*  Is the White House putting forward a funding package [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1524.02s)]
*  to Congress that puts together funding for Israel [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1526.46s)]
*  with funding for the border, funding for Taiwan, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1530.06s)]
*  and funding for Ukraine? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1532.94s)]
*  We're in active conversations with Congress [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1534.1799999999998s)]
*  about additional funding that we know [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1535.82s)]
*  we need specifically for Israel and for Ukraine. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1538.1s)]
*  I'm not prepared to detail those conversations for you right now [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1540.6599999999999s)]
*  or tell you what the parameters are going to be, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1544.7399999999998s)]
*  because frankly, those parameters haven't been yet [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1547.8999999999999s)]
*  arrived at or even decided upon. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1552.54s)]
*  But we are in active discussions about additional funding. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1554.34s)]
*  We need it, as I said in my opening statement. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1556.6999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1558.78s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1560.1799999999998s)]
*  Could you give a little bit of an update [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1561.5s)]
*  on what the administration is doing [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1563.7399999999998s)]
*  to find out more about the Americans who [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1565.86s)]
*  are being held hostage and whatever you're [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1568.62s)]
*  able to discuss about what those efforts look like? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1570.9399999999998s)]
*  Tough. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1573.86s)]
*  Tough to get more detail. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1574.6999999999998s)]
*  We're obviously talking to the Israelis [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1576.3s)]
*  about what they might know. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1580.54s)]
*  I mean, they're on the ground. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1581.6999999999998s)]
*  And they've unfortunately had to deal with this sort [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1582.9799999999998s)]
*  of a scenario before. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1586.1799999999998s)]
*  So they've been tremendously forthcoming with the information [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1587.7399999999998s)]
*  that they have. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1592.86s)]
*  But understanding that the information that even they [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1593.54s)]
*  have right now isn't all that specific. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1595.86s)]
*  I mean, we just don't have a lot of granularity [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1599.42s)]
*  on where these people are or what condition they might be in [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1601.74s)]
*  or whether they're being moved. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1605.34s)]
*  So I truly wish I had more that I could provide, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1606.98s)]
*  because there's a lot of families out there really, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1609.66s)]
*  really worried. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1611.78s)]
*  And the families, quite frankly, too, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1612.54s)]
*  for all their grief and sorrow and the anguish [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1614.78s)]
*  they're going through, some of them [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1617.7s)]
*  have been helpful in terms of helping us understand [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1619.3799999999999s)]
*  where their loved ones were when they were abducted. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1622.74s)]
*  Some of them may have even seen it. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1626.06s)]
*  So it's a conversation that we're having with family members [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1627.54s)]
*  as well. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1630.98s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1632.98s)]
*  I have a question on the role tech platforms are playing [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1634.6200000000001s)]
*  right now. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1639.26s)]
*  The EU has specifically asked Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1639.9s)]
*  to crack down on misleading information related [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1644.66s)]
*  to the attacks on Israel. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1649.02s)]
*  Has the administration had this kind of engagement? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1651.26s)]
*  Is it making the same kind of demands? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1654.94s)]
*  I'm not aware of any such discussions with tech companies [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1657.5s)]
*  about that. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1660.06s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1661.78s)]
*  The US has been warning since Saturday [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1662.86s)]
*  that hostile parties should not be escalating [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1665.3s)]
*  the conflict at this time. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1668.3799999999999s)]
*  What evidence do you have about whether that message has [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1669.5s)]
*  been heeded? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1672.58s)]
*  It's not the kind of thing that they phone in and say, OK, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1674.34s)]
*  got it. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1676.66s)]
*  We have not seen to date, we have not [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1679.02s)]
*  seen another actor intentionally try to widen the conflict. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1683.26s)]
*  All we can go is by what we're seeing and we're not seeing. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1687.62s)]
*  It's important that we send that signal with the arrival [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1691.02s)]
*  of that carrier strike group and with the rhetoric, of course, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1694.62s)]
*  coming out from our administration. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1697.22s)]
*  We'll keep doing that. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1698.7s)]
*  And what variables and within what time frame [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1699.82s)]
*  would the US look to consider when [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1702.42s)]
*  making a decision about deploying additional assets [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1704.02s)]
*  to the region? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1706.7s)]
*  I think it's going to depend on how things are going [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1707.18s)]
*  in the region. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1710.0600000000002s)]
*  Again, we don't want to see this conflict widen any more [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1711.6200000000001s)]
*  than it already has. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1716.3s)]
*  Israel's focused rightly on Hamas. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1718.0600000000002s)]
*  Opening up additional fronts for them, obviously, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1721.38s)]
*  would be just a horrible scenario. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1724.6200000000001s)]
*  We don't want to see that happen. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1726.46s)]
*  Peter. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1728.22s)]
*  Congressman Lawler just said on TV [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1729.74s)]
*  that they're expecting an announcement within 24 hours [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1731.42s)]
*  by an airlift of US citizens. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1734.46s)]
*  Can you tell us anything about that? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1737.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't have any details for you on that. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1738.66s)]
*  I would just tell you, Peter, that we're in the State [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1740.42s)]
*  Department as an active touch with American citizens [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1743.18s)]
*  in Israel, many of them, as you well know, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1746.26s)]
*  are dual nationals, to try to make sure that A, we've [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1748.3000000000002s)]
*  got the connection, and B, that we [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1754.6200000000001s)]
*  know if they have any concerns, like in the case [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1756.9s)]
*  that they want to leave. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1761.3000000000002s)]
*  So we're in active conversations with Americans [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1762.78s)]
*  on the ground there. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1766.5s)]
*  And we want to make sure right now there are still [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1767.62s)]
*  commercial carriers, not all, some, flying in and out [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1772.1399999999999s)]
*  of Ben Gurion every day. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1775.66s)]
*  There are still now viable ground routes [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1777.66s)]
*  if you wanted to leave safely out of Israel. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1780.22s)]
*  That is also an option to you. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1782.74s)]
*  But neither of those options may necessarily [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1784.78s)]
*  be feasible or affordable to certain Americans. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1787.1399999999999s)]
*  And so we are exploring actively a range of other options [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1791.86s)]
*  to assist if Americans want to leave. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1797.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm just not at liberty now to go into more detail about that. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1799.62s)]
*  You said dual citizens. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1803.1399999999999s)]
*  Can you identify, do you know how many of the 22 Americans [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1804.4599999999998s)]
*  who have died and the 17 that are unaccounted for, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1808.1399999999999s)]
*  how many of them are dual citizens versus just [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1810.34s)]
*  pure, you know, fully American citizens? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1813.1s)]
*  The State Department might be able to give you that. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1814.9799999999998s)]
*  I don't have that data handy. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1817.1s)]
*  But again, as you know, so many American citizens in Israel [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1818.9s)]
*  are, in fact, dual passport holders. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1822.9s)]
*  Do the Israelis want decisions on what to do about them [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1824.7800000000002s)]
*  if they are, in fact, mostly dual citizens? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1827.18s)]
*  I'm sorry, say that again. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1829.46s)]
*  Does that mean that we would defer to the Israelis [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1830.18s)]
*  in terms of deciding what actions to take if they're [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1832.26s)]
*  mostly their citizens? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1834.94s)]
*  A dual national with an American passport is an American. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1835.94s)]
*  And we will take seriously our responsibilities [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1840.18s)]
*  to get any wrongfully detained or hostage, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1843.0600000000002s)]
*  American hostage, home to their families where they belong. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1847.22s)]
*  They're Americans. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1850.14s)]
*  John, you talked about the Eisenhower [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1852.1000000000001s)]
*  leaving on his pre-scheduled deployment [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1854.98s)]
*  to potentially be out there in case, positioned near the Ford. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1856.78s)]
*  What about reports about the USS George Washington and also [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1861.34s)]
*  the HMS Prince of Wales? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1864.46s)]
*  Are they also being readied? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1866.06s)]
*  I don't know of any plans for them to be readied. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1868.26s)]
*  Again, I'd refer you to the Defense Department [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1871.82s)]
*  to speak to other units. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1874.38s)]
*  Again, I want to remind, the Eisenhower [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1877.1s)]
*  is preparing for a long scheduled deployment to the region. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1879.8999999999999s)]
*  And I don't have any operational decisions to speak to. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1885.1399999999999s)]
*  I just thought it was important to put that into some context [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1888.02s)]
*  because I saw some reporting yesterday [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1890.26s)]
*  that seemed to suggest it was a definite decision that she [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1891.6999999999998s)]
*  was going to join the Ford. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1894.1799999999998s)]
*  That could happen. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1895.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1896.34s)]
*  But she will be deploying into the Mediterranean [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1897.4599999999998s)]
*  and will be an available asset as well as her escort vessels. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1900.34s)]
*  OK, I have another follow-up here. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1903.62s)]
*  It seems like you've really been trying to project the message [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1905.58s)]
*  that you want to contain this. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1909.94s)]
*  You want to make sure that state and non-state actors get [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1912.34s)]
*  the message that you want to make this contained. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1916.58s)]
*  So how does it help that effort when [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1921.1s)]
*  you have statements like Senator Graham on Capitol Hill saying, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1923.98s)]
*  if Hezbollah in the north attacks Israel in strength, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1927.46s)]
*  we should tell the Ayatollah we will destroy your oil [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1930.6599999999999s)]
*  refineries and your oil infrastructure. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1932.98s)]
*  How worried are you about statements like that? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1935.18s)]
*  I'll let members of Congress speak for their comments [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1938.02s)]
*  and what they think should be done or should not be done. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1940.26s)]
*  The president is the commander in chief. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1945.5s)]
*  The responsibility is on his shoulders. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1947.04s)]
*  And he's also, of course, a strong supporter of Israel, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1949.8600000000001s)]
*  has been for his entire life in public service. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1953.7s)]
*  We have to answer for the policy decisions that we make. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1956.42s)]
*  And we're comfortable doing that. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1960.7s)]
*  Carol? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1962.78s)]
*  John, over here. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1963.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1964.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's OK. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1965.28s)]
*  The bomber's head is right there. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1966.26s)]
*  Just scoot down a little bit. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1969.46s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1970.94s)]
*  On the humanitarian corridor, I know [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1973.82s)]
*  you said there's conversations ongoing. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1975.42s)]
*  Could you provide some more detail? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1977.66s)]
*  I mean, what would the US's involvement in that be? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1978.98s)]
*  Are we talking encouraging conversations [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1981.8600000000001s)]
*  with Israel and Egypt? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1984.3s)]
*  Would we have direct involvement in creating [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1985.58s)]
*  some kind of a humanitarian corridor here [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1987.34s)]
*  for the 2 million plus people to leave? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1989.34s)]
*  They have no option at this point. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1993.3799999999999s)]
*  We want to see that they have an option. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1995.78s)]
*  And Israel and Egypt are the two most significant players [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=1998.86s)]
*  when it comes to trying to get that corridor open. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2003.6999999999998s)]
*  So I think you can understand, at least I hope you do, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2007.4599999999998s)]
*  that I wouldn't want to get into too much of the diplomacy [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2010.26s)]
*  here and the conversations that we're having. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2013.5s)]
*  But we are having active conversations [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2015.8999999999999s)]
*  about trying to allow for that safe passage. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2017.8999999999999s)]
*  So again, these civilians did nothing wrong. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2020.5s)]
*  And so we want to make sure they have a way out. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2022.6999999999998s)]
*  Did the president and prime minister Netanyahu [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2024.74s)]
*  have a conversation about this this morning, yesterday? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2027.26s)]
*  As I said in my first answer, I'm [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2030.9399999999998s)]
*  not going to get into too much of the diplomacy here. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2032.74s)]
*  And could you get into the specifics on the aid [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2034.9399999999998s)]
*  that you said the US would want to provide to the Gaza Strip? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2036.86s)]
*  I mean, with no food or medications, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2040.26s)]
*  what kind of aid would the US want to provide? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2042.4199999999998s)]
*  The normal kind of humanitarian assistance [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2043.74s)]
*  we provide normally. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2045.4599999999998s)]
*  We are the biggest contributor to humanitarian assistance [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2046.7s)]
*  to the Palestinian people, particularly there in Gaza. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2050.82s)]
*  And we want to be able to see that assistance continue. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2053.3s)]
*  So it's food, water, medical supplies, medicine. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2056.58s)]
*  I mean, it's the whole panoply of humanitarian assistance [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2060.86s)]
*  that we know are important. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2063.94s)]
*  Because again, these people are victims too. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2065.1s)]
*  They didn't ask Hamas to do this. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2067.78s)]
*  Is there an increase, though, in the amount of aid [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2069.98s)]
*  that's going? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2073.98s)]
*  I don't have any new announcements [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2074.9s)]
*  to make in terms of increases. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2076.34s)]
*  We are the greatest contributor of humanitarian assistance. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2078.5s)]
*  We're obviously proud of that. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2081.82s)]
*  We want to be able to see that humanitarian assistance [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2083.1400000000003s)]
*  be able to continue. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2085.7000000000003s)]
*  Go ahead, Ed. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2087.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2087.86s)]
*  I want to ask you about oil, if I could, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2088.38s)]
*  and the money that it's bringing in. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2090.02s)]
*  So is the amount of oil that's being brought in by Iran, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2091.52s)]
*  specifically records amount, 85% to China, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2095.26s)]
*  more oil being sold above the price cap from Russia, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2097.9s)]
*  giving the president any pause on changing these energy [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2101.3s)]
*  policies for fossil fuels here in the US? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2104.54s)]
*  Just let me back up a little bit. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2108.22s)]
*  I mean, it's important to remember [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2109.74s)]
*  that Iran gets most of its oil revenue off the black market. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2112.14s)]
*  And evading sanctions, which they do, it's costly to them. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2115.74s)]
*  In fact, our evidence is that they really only [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2121.42s)]
*  receive a fraction of the market value of the oil [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2125.14s)]
*  that they sell, because they have to sell it [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2128.02s)]
*  on the black market. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2130.06s)]
*  We will always, as we do in any case, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2131.7s)]
*  typically revisit sanctions regimes [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2135.98s)]
*  to see if they need to be changed or adjusted, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2138.3399999999997s)]
*  specifically with respect to Iranian oil. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2141.02s)]
*  The president, since the beginning of the administration, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2144.3799999999997s)]
*  has been concerned about making sure we have a viable global [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2148.58s)]
*  market for oil, working hard to keep the prices of gasoline [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2152.98s)]
*  down here in the United States. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2157.06s)]
*  Part of that is making sure you remove some of the volatility [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2158.3799999999997s)]
*  in that global supply and demand. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2160.96s)]
*  I don't have any announcements or decisions [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2163.64s)]
*  to make today with respect to any changes [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2165.76s)]
*  to the domestic oil production. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2168.4s)]
*  But isn't it a national security issue [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2170.08s)]
*  when you have countries that are profiting off of oil [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2172.08s)]
*  and the increased price of oil that don't like Israel, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2174.8s)]
*  that don't like America? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2177.52s)]
*  We don't want, for instance, Russia [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2179.48s)]
*  to be able to get a windfall in profits from the oil market [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2181.76s)]
*  so that they can then turn that around and apply that [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2187.48s)]
*  to weapons in Ukraine. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2191.76s)]
*  We certainly don't want to see Iran [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2193.12s)]
*  be able to do much of the same, which is why we're putting [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2196.76s)]
*  as much pressure on them as we are. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2199.92s)]
*  So why not increase oil production here? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2201.12s)]
*  Again, I don't have any announcements to make today. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2203.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2204.8s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2206.32s)]
*  Just to follow up on Brian's question, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2207.2s)]
*  I know Contour is a congressional package [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2208.76s)]
*  that's still taking shape. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2210.56s)]
*  But can you provide us anything on a timeline [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2211.64s)]
*  or give us a sense of how quickly the US would exhaust [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2213.8s)]
*  what it can provide to Israel before congressional action [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2216.72s)]
*  is needed? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2219.7999999999997s)]
*  We have existing authorities and appropriations [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2220.2799999999997s)]
*  to support Israel in the near term. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2222.6s)]
*  And I got asked last time, what does near term [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2226.3599999999997s)]
*  or what's a bit mean? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2228.6s)]
*  I can't give you a date certain on the calendar [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2230.12s)]
*  because a lot of it's going to depend on their expenditure [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2232.16s)]
*  rate and what the replenishment ability is, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2234.68s)]
*  what the need is, and what our ability to do it is. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2237.08s)]
*  But in the near term, we've got appropriations and authorities [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2239.8399999999997s)]
*  for both, Ukraine and for Israel. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2243.7599999999998s)]
*  You don't want to be trying to bake in long term support when [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2247.64s)]
*  you're at the end of the rope. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2252.52s)]
*  And in Ukraine, on the Ukraine funding, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2254.44s)]
*  we're coming near to the end of the rope. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2257.24s)]
*  I mean, today we announced $200 million. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2259.24s)]
*  And we'll keep that aid going as long as we can. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2262.72s)]
*  But it's not going to be indefinite. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2265.3599999999997s)]
*  So are we moving with a sense of a lacquerie? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2267.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2269.2799999999997s)]
*  I couldn't give you a date certain on the calendar. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2269.8399999999997s)]
*  Can I follow up on that for a second? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2272.2s)]
*  The lack of a speaker in the House of Representatives, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2274.76s)]
*  I'll venture to say, has probably not had any impact [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2277.1200000000003s)]
*  on this situation at the moment. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2279.4s)]
*  Are there, though, coming to be immediate needs for Israel [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2281.92s)]
*  if Republicans get their act together up on the Hill? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2286.32s)]
*  I mean, I don't need to tell you. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2288.96s)]
*  It's Civics 101. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2290.6800000000003s)]
*  The Speaker of the House is responsible. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2291.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, that position is critical in terms [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2293.36s)]
*  of bringing legislation to the floor [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2295.96s)]
*  and moving things forward. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2298.8s)]
*  So the sooner there's a Speaker of the House, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2301.4s)]
*  obviously the more comfortable we'll all [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2303.48s)]
*  be in terms of being able to support Israel and Ukraine. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2305.28s)]
*  Right now, you're right. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2308.08s)]
*  Because of existing appropriations [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2309.56s)]
*  and existing authorities, we've been OK. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2311.28s)]
*  But that's not going to last forever. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2314.12s)]
*  A couple more. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2315.84s)]
*  Immediate needs at all? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2316.6s)]
*  Pardon me? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2317.84s)]
*  Immediate needs at all, do you see? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2318.34s)]
*  I think in the immediate term right now, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2320.6s)]
*  we can continue to support with the authorities [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2323.04s)]
*  and the appropriations we have, Israel and Ukraine. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2325.68s)]
*  But we're certainly running out of runway. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2328.12s)]
*  All right, just a couple more. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2331.68s)]
*  Thank you, Kareem. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2333.44s)]
*  Two questions. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2334.7200000000003s)]
*  Given the situation in the Middle East, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2335.8s)]
*  will the White House lean on the Senate [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2338.28s)]
*  to move some of these military promotions more quickly [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2340.0400000000004s)]
*  and one by one, if necessary? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2343.88s)]
*  And then second, more generally, given [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2346.2000000000003s)]
*  that Hamas has killed 22 Americans [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2350.1200000000003s)]
*  and that 17 are still in hostage, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2352.32s)]
*  I know you said the goal here is not to widen the conflict. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2355.48s)]
*  But why has the United States only [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2359.4s)]
*  assumed a supplemental role thus far? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2360.92s)]
*  So on your first question, what's going on in Israel [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2364.8s)]
*  right now just underscores how important [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2371.84s)]
*  it is that our military has the leadership they need in place. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2375.76s)]
*  And it's not just the ones that are in the jobs now [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2381.6s)]
*  that are being held up. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2383.7200000000003s)]
*  It's the jobs they're supposed to go to. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2384.84s)]
*  I mean, right now, the incoming fifth fleet commander, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2388.08s)]
*  the three-star Navy Admiral who's [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2391.08s)]
*  in charge of the Naval forces in the Gulf region [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2392.7599999999998s)]
*  is not confirmed for that job. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2397.96s)]
*  So the guy who's in the job is still doing it. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2399.48s)]
*  So these rotations matter. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2402.3199999999997s)]
*  And they do have an impact on the military's ability [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2403.56s)]
*  to fleet up and improve the leadership capability [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2407.0s)]
*  across the force. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2411.68s)]
*  So it is having an impact. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2412.36s)]
*  And it would anyway. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2414.36s)]
*  But I think now that you've got these moves in Israel [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2415.76s)]
*  and you have the need to provide additional military resources [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2420.6800000000003s)]
*  from the Navy and the Eastern Med, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2424.6800000000003s)]
*  all I think just highlights how dynamic the security [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2426.1200000000003s)]
*  environment is around the world and how much more critical it [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2430.1600000000003s)]
*  is that the leadership of the military [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2432.7200000000003s)]
*  be able to address that dynamism through the normal promotion [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2434.32s)]
*  process and the normal assignment process. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2438.0400000000004s)]
*  I would take issue with your comment [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2441.3599999999997s)]
*  about a supplemental role. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2444.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm not really quite sure what you mean by that. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2446.52s)]
*  But- [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2449.12s)]
*  You said that we were willing to assess and offer advice [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2449.62s)]
*  and counsel. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2452.3599999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2452.8799999999997s)]
*  We are. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2453.3599999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2453.8799999999997s)]
*  And we're going to continue to have those conversations [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2454.68s)]
*  with the Israelis. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2456.52s)]
*  If you're talking about the hostage recovery efforts, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2457.2799999999997s)]
*  we'll have those conversations. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2459.72s)]
*  But as Jake said yesterday, we'll [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2461.24s)]
*  do what we need to do for our citizens who [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2463.56s)]
*  are being held hostage. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2466.72s)]
*  We will do what we need to do. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2467.72s)]
*  We'll do what is possible to do. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2469.44s)]
*  But I think, as you heard in my answer to Mary, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2471.2000000000003s)]
*  we just don't have a whole lot of fingertip feel. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2473.4s)]
*  It's hard to come up with a policy option when you're not [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2476.48s)]
*  really sure where they are, how many they are, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2478.96s)]
*  whether they're being moved. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2481.08s)]
*  So we're working this very hard hour by hour. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2482.52s)]
*  But I'm not going to stand up here and lie to you [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2485.28s)]
*  and say that we have it all figured out. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2487.2000000000003s)]
*  Thanks, Eric. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2489.08s)]
*  Have a good one. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2489.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2490.08s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2490.58s)]

*  A few very quick questions. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2501.72s)]
*  I want to follow up on the reports [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2502.7999999999997s)]
*  that Hamas is calling for the general mobilization [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2505.12s)]

*  that American Jews should take, in your opinion? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2511.8799999999997s)]
*  You mean here at home? [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2515.72s)]
*  Here at home. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2516.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, first of all, I mean, you've [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2518.3599999999997s)]
*  heard the president talk about this. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2521.3599999999997s)]
*  We understand the anxiety, the concern. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2522.72s)]
*  Certainly, here in the United States, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2527.72s)]
*  as anti-Semitism unfortunately rears its head. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2530.72s)]
*  But also, we know that the Jewish community [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2533.8399999999997s)]
*  is almost like a family. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2537.68s)]
*  It's big, but it's small. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2539.64s)]
*  And everybody knows somebody. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2541.12s)]
*  And we know that there's so many Americans [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2542.7999999999997s)]
*  in the Jewish community here who are [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2545.12s)]
*  worried about friends and family members that are there. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2546.7599999999998s)]
*  We share that worry with them. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2550.56s)]
*  We want them to know that we know that there's fear [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2553.08s)]
*  and that we're going to do everything [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2559.4s)]
*  we can to reduce that level of fear, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2561.52s)]
*  that they should be able to worship and recreate and work [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2563.6s)]
*  in peace and safety on every street in the United [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2568.24s)]
*  States of America. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2571.0s)]
*  And that's why we're working so closely with state [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2571.7999999999997s)]
*  and local authorities to be able to identify [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2573.7999999999997s)]
*  any potential threats and disrupt those threats [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2576.04s)]
*  before they happen. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2578.88s)]
*  But mostly, we want the Jewish community over there, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2579.72s)]
*  and certainly here, to know that we're with them. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2583.3199999999997s)]
*  I've got one more question, John. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2586.16s)]
*  In the event Israel strikes Iran, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2588.8399999999997s)]
*  what levels of support can they anticipate [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2590.68s)]
*  from this administration? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2592.7599999999998s)]
*  I won't get into hypothetical operations [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2593.4399999999996s)]
*  that haven't happened yet or what policy options might [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2595.24s)]
*  accrue from that. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2597.72s)]
*  I just won't do it. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2598.48s)]
*  Mary, you have the last question. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2600.64s)]
*  Thanks, I appreciate it. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2602.2s)]
*  I know you said that it's been so hard to get any information [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2603.12s)]
*  out about US hostages. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2605.7999999999997s)]
*  But have you gotten any proof of life? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2607.36s)]
*  I'm not aware of any specific proof of life [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2609.76s)]
*  on any individual hostage. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2612.96s)]
*  And I would say that of the 17 that Kareem talked about [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2615.36s)]
*  that we know are missing, right now, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2620.88s)]
*  and again, this is going to change, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2624.1600000000003s)]
*  but right now, we think the number that we know [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2625.6200000000003s)]
*  or we believe are held hostage is very small, very small, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2628.0s)]
*  like less than a handful. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2632.1600000000003s)]
*  But that could change over time. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2633.88s)]
*  We're going to get more information every single day. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2636.36s)]
*  You talked about the need to get out. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2639.56s)]
*  US was supporting trying to get more humanitarian assistance [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2641.6s)]
*  into Gaza. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2644.76s)]
*  The UN human rights chief said that any siege that [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2646.36s)]
*  would cut off necessary supplies like food and water [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2650.36s)]
*  could also be a violation of international law. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2653.08s)]
*  Is that how the US sees it? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2655.6800000000003s)]
*  I think I'm just going to not get ahead of where we are right [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2657.0s)]
*  now, if you'll just let me do that. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2659.92s)]
*  OK, thanks, everybody. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2662.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2664.0s)]
*  All right, guys, we're a few minutes. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2665.28s)]
*  Thanks, Admiral. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2667.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if you guys have any more questions. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2669.6000000000004s)]
*  Em? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2672.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2673.0s)]
*  So the CBO yesterday said that the budget deficit totaled [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2674.6000000000004s)]
*  $1.7 trillion, which is an increase from $300 billion [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2678.6000000000004s)]
*  from last year. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2682.6000000000004s)]
*  Why did the deficit increase with the US economy [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2684.6800000000003s)]
*  doing so well, as President Biden has said? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2688.52s)]
*  So a couple of things. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2691.2400000000002s)]
*  As you know, the president has, when [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2692.4s)]
*  it comes to the deficit, he has done a record amount of work [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2693.92s)]
*  in reducing the deficit, as you just laid out. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2698.04s)]
*  And one of the things that we have seen [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2701.36s)]
*  is that congressional Democrats continue to do the trickle down [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2704.2400000000002s)]
*  economics, which we know doesn't work. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2707.12s)]
*  You've heard us call it meganomics. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2709.28s)]
*  And so it has increased the deficit. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2711.96s)]
*  It has increased even more than it was anticipated. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2714.56s)]
*  And so this is what we believe is a meganomics deficit. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2721.88s)]
*  And the reason why, just a couple of things to lay out here, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2725.32s)]
*  if you think about the Republican tax cuts, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2728.08s)]
*  they are responsible for about 90% of the increase [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2730.1200000000003s)]
*  in the debt as a share of the economy. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2732.96s)]
*  And that's over the last two decades. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2735.2000000000003s)]
*  This is for some time now. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2737.1600000000003s)]
*  And that's including that one-time emergency spending. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2739.84s)]
*  And so if you look at 2023, the increase, as you just laid out, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2744.84s)]
*  the falling tax revenue caused 63% [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2750.2s)]
*  of the increase in the deficit. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2752.68s)]
*  And the non-interest spending was not [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2754.3599999999997s)]
*  responsible for the increase in the deficit in 2023. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2756.3599999999997s)]
*  But it's causing just 6% of the increase. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2759.68s)]
*  So that's how we see the numbers from the CBO. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2762.3599999999997s)]
*  That's how we kind of break it down. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2766.6s)]
*  That's how it's been broken down and how we see [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2768.04s)]
*  why the deficit has increased. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2771.0s)]
*  Again, this is decades and decades, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2772.44s)]
*  if you think about it, of trickle down economics. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2774.96s)]
*  It just doesn't work. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2777.3999999999996s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2779.08s)]
*  And we see that in the numbers from yesterday. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2780.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2782.72s)]
*  House Republicans are suggesting that another CR bill [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2784.4s)]
*  could be needed potentially into next year. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2788.08s)]
*  Would the President support such a bill [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2790.88s)]
*  in delaying this appropriations process again? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2792.88s)]
*  I'm not going to get ahead or get into the hypotheticals [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2795.64s)]
*  of how Congress is doing their business. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2799.12s)]
*  Obviously, the House Republicans have to figure out [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2801.64s)]
*  who's going to be the next leader. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2804.64s)]
*  As the President said, he doesn't have a vote in that. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2806.04s)]
*  They have to make that decision as they're moving forward [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2807.8s)]
*  and figuring that out. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2810.6000000000004s)]
*  But what we want to see is what we want to see happening [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2813.44s)]
*  is that we want the House and Congress to get back to work, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2816.7200000000003s)]
*  to get to work so that we can deliver for the American people. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2820.44s)]
*  I'm not going to get into hypotheticals, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2822.8s)]
*  not going to get into their process here, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2824.04s)]
*  but certainly they're trying to figure it out right now [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2826.7200000000003s)]
*  in the chaos that they've caused. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2829.6000000000004s)]
*  If there is another CR bill, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2831.4s)]
*  does the President want to see Ukraine [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2833.2400000000002s)]
*  and Israel aid in that? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2835.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we've been very clear. We believe, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2836.88s)]
*  and this is something that Jake said yesterday, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2839.28s)]
*  like we are capable as the United States, right, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2841.52s)]
*  to be able to give funding, additional funding to Israel, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2844.2000000000003s)]
*  to give additional funding to Ukraine. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2847.7200000000003s)]
*  This is something that we are capable of doing, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2849.88s)]
*  and the importance of doing that is clearly important. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2852.2000000000003s)]
*  There's going to be a path forward [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2858.28s)]
*  that the OMB director is going to lay out [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2859.76s)]
*  and see the best way to move forward. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2863.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to get ahead of that. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2864.8s)]
*  We heard the President yesterday saying that he is going to, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2866.2s)]
*  as you just iterated, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2869.2799999999997s)]
*  that he's going to ask for more funding as it relates to Israel. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2871.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm just not going to get ahead of that process. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2874.7599999999998s)]
*  But this is something, again, that Jake said, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2876.6s)]
*  we are capable of doing that, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2878.7999999999997s)]
*  capable of providing the assistance that's needed. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2880.2799999999997s)]
*  Just before we came out here, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2885.8399999999997s)]
*  the Republicans voted to nominate [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2887.04s)]
*  Congressman Scalise as the speaker. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2889.52s)]
*  He obviously hasn't been gotten the support [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2891.0s)]
*  of the entire caucus yet. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2893.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm wondering if the White House is monitoring that [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2895.04s)]
*  and if you have any comment on a potential speaker of Scalise. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2897.24s)]
*  Look, I hope that the House Republicans [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2901.32s)]
*  gets their affairs in order and stops the chaos [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2903.8s)]
*  so that we can, you know, they can select, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2906.52s)]
*  they can select the speakers of their choosing [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2908.8s)]
*  so that we can move forward and do the people's business. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2911.72s)]
*  We're not part of the process. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2914.96s)]
*  We're not going to comment about the process. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2916.4s)]
*  As the President has said, he doesn't have a vote in that process. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2917.96s)]
*  But we want to see the chaos be done with [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2921.2799999999997s)]
*  so that we can deliver for the American people. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2923.92s)]
*  As you heard today, the President made [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2927.2400000000002s)]
*  a very important announcement on junk fees, right? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2928.76s)]
*  Something that Americans care about, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2931.2400000000002s)]
*  another way to lower costs for Americans. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2933.16s)]
*  So the President's continuing, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2936.12s)]
*  even with the chaos that they're causing [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2937.64s)]
*  on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2939.92s)]
*  The President every day is continuing [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2941.76s)]
*  to deliver for the American people, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2943.4s)]
*  clearly being a leader on the world stage [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2945.16s)]
*  as we're talking about the horrific attack in Israel, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2947.4s)]
*  as we're talking about how we're going to, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2950.88s)]
*  the need to continue the Ukraine funding. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2953.48s)]
*  So the President is doing all of that, and we're waiting. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2956.04s)]
*  We're waiting for them to get their business in order. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2959.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, Kayla. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2962.0800000000004s)]
*  How soon after House leadership gets settled [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2962.88s)]
*  is the administration prepared to send a new supplemental request? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2964.96s)]
*  I don't have a timeline for you. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2968.7200000000003s)]
*  I think the President said next week, right? [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2971.1600000000003s)]
*  He mentioned next week as it relates to Israel [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2973.0800000000004s)]
*  and when the Senate gets back. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2976.5600000000004s)]
*  I just don't have anything specific [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2978.36s)]
*  or any details to lay out on the exact timeline. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2980.2s)]
*  And how closely does it hew to what the administration [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2982.7599999999998s)]
*  put forward in August with the addition [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2984.8799999999997s)]
*  of new funding for Israel? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2987.3999999999996s)]
*  Again, we're going to try and figure out the best path forward. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2988.7599999999998s)]
*  I just don't have anything specific to lay out at this time. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2991.12s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2995.96s)]
*  Thanks, Crain. Do you have a list of attendees [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2997.0s)]
*  for today's meeting on anti-Semitism? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=2999.2799999999997s)]
*  So we'll have a list for all of you, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3001.24s)]
*  a readout of that later on. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3003.2799999999997s)]
*  It's about, I believe, 20 leaders from the Jewish community. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3005.44s)]
*  I laid out the staff, the senior staffers [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3009.24s)]
*  who are going to be participating on our end. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3012.9199999999996s)]
*  And we certainly have a more in-depth readout afterwards. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3015.0s)]
*  Thanks, Crain. On junk fees, most of the fees [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3019.7999999999997s)]
*  they talked about are disclosures and don't reduce. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3023.3599999999997s)]
*  But the ones that do reduce, isn't this just a game of whack-a-mole [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3025.3599999999997s)]
*  and those fees will pop up somewhere else? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3028.48s)]
*  Look, no, not at all. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3030.64s)]
*  These are FTC rule covers, many junk fees. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3032.3199999999997s)]
*  And just to lay out a little bit, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3035.72s)]
*  and I think you've heard this from many of our folks [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3037.0s)]
*  here in the past 24 hours, why this is so important. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3039.64s)]
*  They cost consumers tens of billions of dollars [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3042.8s)]
*  if you think about junk fees. That's what they cost consumers. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3044.92s)]
*  And this FTC rule would ban many of them, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3047.56s)]
*  as I just laid out, including event tickets, hotels, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3050.08s)]
*  car rentals, delivery apps, and apartment rentals. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3054.36s)]
*  And so this is CFPB's crackdown. It's important. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3057.36s)]
*  The President has been very clear throughout his, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3062.52s)]
*  when he talks about his economic plan, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3064.48s)]
*  he talks about how he's going to move forward [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3066.0s)]
*  to deliver for the American people in lowering costs. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3068.6s)]
*  And this is part of that, lowering costs, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3071.24s)]
*  making people's lives, Americans' lives a little bit easier. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3073.32s)]
*  So we do not see this as a whack-a-mole. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3076.44s)]
*  We believe that the junk fees will cover many, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3078.52s)]
*  many of the fees that we see out there, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3082.28s)]
*  as I just listed out. Right behind you, Ken. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3083.64s)]
*  The Press Thank you. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3086.36s)]
*  This is related to the situation in the House. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3087.96s)]
*  But is it the view of the White House [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3091.4s)]
*  that the intelligence gang of eight [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3093.4s)]
*  that receives the top-level briefings [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3097.32s)]
*  from the executive branch has eight members, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3100.2400000000002s)]
*  or is the Speaker Pro Tem, Mr. McHenry, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3103.6400000000003s)]
*  getting the security briefings at the very top level, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3109.88s)]
*  or are there effectively only seven members [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3113.48s)]
*  with the Speaker being the Speaker? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3115.8s)]
*  I would refer you to the Speaker Pro Tem. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3117.44s)]
*  I don't have that information for you. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3120.08s)]

*  The President's schedule has been incredibly busy [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3157.84s)]
*  over the last couple of days, as you know, right, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3159.84s)]

*  that he wanted to drop by and have a conversation [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3172.76s)]
*  and say that we are there with them. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edD2ohcmSvM&t=3175.4s)]
