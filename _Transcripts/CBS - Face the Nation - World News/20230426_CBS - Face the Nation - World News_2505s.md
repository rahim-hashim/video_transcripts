*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=830.26s)]
*  Your top economic priority has been to build up [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=831.86s)]
*  U.S. domestic manufacturing in competition with China. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=835.46s)]
*  But your rules against expanding chip manufacturing in China [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=839.5600000000001s)]
*  is hurting South Korean companies [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=843.36s)]
*  that rely heavily on Beijing. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=845.26s)]
*  Are you damaging a key ally in the competition with China [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=847.46s)]
*  to help your domestic politics ahead of the election, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=851.16s)]
*  and one for President Yun? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=854.26s)]
*  There have been concerns since last year [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=856.66s)]
*  that North Korea will soon be conducting [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=859.16s)]
*  its seventh nuclear test [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=862.06s)]
*  amid growing domestic support in your country [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=864.06s)]
*  for your own nuclear weapons. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=866.4599999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, Russia has suggested [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=868.66s)]
*  it could send its latest weapons to North Korea [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=870.36s)]
*  if South Korea sends lethal aid to Ukraine. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=873.66s)]
*  How do you seek to manage the North Korea risk [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=876.86s)]
*  amid obligations to Ukraine and NATO? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=879.9599999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=882.4599999999999s)]
*  Let me respond to your question first. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=883.86s)]
*  The President, my desire to increase U.S. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=886.46s)]
*  manufacturing and jobs in America is not about China. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=890.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm not concerned about China. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=895.26s)]
*  Remember, America invented a semiconductor. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=897.1600000000001s)]
*  We invented it. We used to have 40 percent of the market, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=901.26s)]
*  and we decided that what we're going to do over the past, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=904.76s)]
*  I don't know how many decades, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=908.6600000000001s)]
*  we decided that it was going to be cheaper [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=910.6600000000001s)]
*  to export jobs and import product. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=912.26s)]
*  And along came the pandemic, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=916.0600000000001s)]
*  and the pandemic taught us that we used to have, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=917.96s)]
*  as I said, 40 percent of the market just some years ago. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=919.96s)]
*  Now it's down to 10 percent. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=922.96s)]
*  And again, we invented the super-her- — we got — [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=924.96s)]
*  so I decided to go out and see what we could do [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=927.86s)]
*  to increase our hold on the market once again. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=929.86s)]
*  And so what I did was I went around the country [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=933.86s)]
*  as well as an additional passion in the Chips and Science Act. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=936.26s)]
*  In fact, I visited countries around the world. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=940.86s)]
*  And two significant South Korean companies decided [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=944.76s)]
*  they were going to invest billions of dollars [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=948.9599999999999s)]
*  in chip manufacturing in the United States. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=951.06s)]
*  It wasn't designed to hurt China. It was designed to — [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=953.76s)]
*  so we didn't have to worry about whether or not [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=956.16s)]
*  we had access to semiconductors. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=958.56s)]
*  For example, during the pandemic, what happened was, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=961.56s)]
*  all of a sudden, everybody started to learn [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=963.56s)]
*  the phrase supply chain. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=965.76s)]
*  A year ago, no one knew what the hell [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=967.3599999999999s)]
*  anybody was talking about when he said supply chain. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=969.4599999999999s)]
*  But now they all know, and we lost access to these — [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=971.86s)]
*  these semiconductors, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=975.96s)]
*  in which new automobiles in the United States [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=977.66s)]
*  need 30,000 of them just to build a new automobile. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=979.36s)]
*  And we didn't have them. So we started to invest here. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=981.96s)]
*  And what happened was when we encouraged the investment [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=985.66s)]
*  through the Chips and Science Act, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=987.96s)]
*  and now we have enormous investment in the United States [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=990.16s)]
*  for over $200 billion in long-term investment [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=993.96s)]
*  in semiconductors. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=997.56s)]
*  And we're rebuilding the economy of the United States [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=999.16s)]
*  with those semiconductors. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1002.16s)]
*  It's not designed to hurt China. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1003.9599999999999s)]
*  The only thing I did say with regard to China, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1005.86s)]
*  there are certain extremely sophisticated semiconductors [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1008.4599999999999s)]
*  that we have built that are useful for nuclear [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1011.4599999999999s)]
*  and or other weapons systems — [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1014.36s)]
*  those we are not selling, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1016.16s)]
*  whether we're not exporting to China or anyone else. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1017.86s)]
*  And so that's the context in which this has all occurred. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1021.26s)]
*  In the meantime, we've created thousands of jobs [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1024.26s)]
*  and bringing back a sense of pride and dignity [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1027.06s)]
*  to so many towns in the country where, all of a sudden, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1029.56s)]
*  over the last three decades, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1032.96s)]
*  we found out that factory that hired — [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1034.8600000000001s)]
*  had 600 people shut down. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1038.16s)]
*  The soul of that community was lost. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1040.96s)]
*  And so I made sure when the semiconductors were coming back [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1043.66s)]
*  that they were not just going to go to the coast, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1046.76s)]
*  they'd be all over the country. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1048.96s)]
*  And so we have a significant field of dreams [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1050.66s)]
*  in — outside of — in Ohio, outside of Columbus. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1053.56s)]
*  We're in Texas. We're in Arizona. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1059.56s)]
*  Anyway, they're all over the country. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1061.6599999999999s)]
*  So it's not viewed to hurt anyone else. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1063.56s)]
*  We are providing access to those semiconductors. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1065.36s)]
*  We're not — we're a supply chain you can count on. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1068.46s)]
*  But we are not — we are not going to sit back [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1071.26s)]
*  and be in a position where we don't have access [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1074.06s)]
*  to those semiconductors. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1076.56s)]
*  We are not going to be a place where we're the end of that line. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1078.36s)]
*  We're the beginning of it. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1082.66s)]
*  And it's generating significant economic growth in America [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1084.5600000000002s)]
*  and not hurting anybody. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1088.26s)]
*  And, by the way, it's creating jobs in — in South Korea. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1089.3600000000001s)]
*  It's creating jobs in South Korea, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1095.5600000000002s)]
*  not just with SK, but — anyway, with Samsung [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1097.26s)]
*  and other — other industries. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1100.0600000000002s)]
*  So I think it's a win-win. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1102.66s)]
*  We are watching a joint press conference [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1104.26s)]
*  between President Biden and Yoon Suk-yul, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1114.26s)]
*  the president of the Republic of Korea. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1117.16s)]
*  They're at the White House as the two announced a joint strategy [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1119.06s)]
*  as far as nuclear strategy called the Washington Declaration. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1124.56s)]
*  Let's continue to listen in and discuss on the other end [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1128.16s)]
*  after the questions are answered. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1132.26s)]
*  This is different from the past. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1133.76s)]
*  First of all, we have an NCG nuclear consultative group [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1135.66s)]
*  that has been launched that will implement discussions and actions. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1143.86s)]
*  And we will hold regular meetings and consultations under NCG. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1148.86s)]
*  We will share information on mutual nuclear assets and intelligence. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1153.86s)]
*  And we will jointly plan responses [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1158.86s)]
*  and also jointly plan exercises and drills and implementation plans. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1164.46s)]
*  So all of these will be strengthened and specified [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1171.36s)]
*  under the nuclear consultative group. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1174.46s)]
*  We want to customize our response against North Korea's nuclear threat [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1179.1599999999999s)]
*  based on extended deterrence. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1184.76s)]
*  And in the process of achieving this goal, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1186.86s)]
*  any concerns that Koreans may have against North Korea nuclear weapons [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1191.76s)]
*  will be relieved, I believe. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1195.36s)]
*  If nuclear weapons are used, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1199.56s)]
*  our two countries will strengthen our response in a swift manner. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1201.1599999999999s)]
*  Any further questions to me? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1216.86s)]
*  Please. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1228.76s)]
*  Reporter Won from ON1NTN, I have two questions for you. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1237.26s)]
*  With regard to extended deterrence, the NCG that has been formed, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1243.76s)]
*  how will Korea function under NCG? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1250.76s)]
*  Any kind of nuclear equipped nuclear assets will be in function. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1254.46s)]
*  And to President Biden, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1261.36s)]
*  Korea is to maintain the NPT and it is to strengthen extended deterrence, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1264.76s)]
*  correct? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1269.16s)]
*  So based on your view, do you think this is enough? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1269.96s)]
*  To guard Korea against the North Korean nuclear threat? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1273.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1277.16s)]
*  Well, let me address your question about the activities of the NCG. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1281.86s)]
*  We are going to be sharing information and we're going to be acting jointly. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1286.86s)]
*  That is the key. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1290.66s)]
*  I can't talk to the specifics right now about what type of information [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1293.76s)]
*  and what type of specific activities we will be conducting. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1296.86s)]
*  But however, under the nuclear umbrella, our extended deterrence was a lot lower. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1300.56s)]
*  So right now it's an unprecedented expansion and strengthening of the extended [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1307.1599999999999s)]
*  deterrence strategy under the Washington Declaration, which will create the NCG. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1311.06s)]
*  The implementation and the response [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1318.86s)]
*  at this level has never thus far been this strong. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1324.26s)]
*  So this is a new level of extended deterrence, much stronger, that I can say with confidence. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1329.8600000000001s)]
*  The response that I would give you is that [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1337.26s)]
*  extended deterrence means that we are having more consultation with whatever [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1340.66s)]
*  actions to be contemplated or taken. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1346.76s)]
*  And we made it really very, very clear. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1349.76s)]
*  Any other ROK has repeatedly formed its, confirmed its commitment to [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1353.26s)]
*  to the nonproliferation treaty. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1358.76s)]
*  The Washington Declaration is a prudent step to reinforce extended deterrence [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1361.06s)]
*  and respond to advancing DPRK nuclear threat. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1365.86s)]
*  Look, nuclear attack by North Korea against the United States or its allies [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1369.36s)]
*  or partisans or partners is unacceptable and will result in the end of whatever [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1374.06s)]
*  regime were to take such an action. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1380.36s)]
*  And it's about strengthening deterrence in response to DPRK's escalatory behavior [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1382.66s)]
*  and to deal in complete consultation. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1387.86s)]
*  And, you know, the idea that I have absolute authority as commander-in-chief [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1391.06s)]
*  and the sole authority to use the nuclear weapon. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1397.36s)]
*  But, you know, what the declaration means is that we're going to make every effort [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1400.56s)]
*  to consult with our allies when it's appropriate, if any action is so called for. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1404.56s)]
*  Certainly, we've talked about this and some other things today, but the bottom line here is [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1409.86s)]
*  there's even closer cooperation, closer consultation. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1415.96s)]
*  And we're not going to be stationing nuclear weapons on the peninsula, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1419.8600000000001s)]
*  but we will have visits to ports visits of nuclear submarines and things like that. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1425.3600000000001s)]
*  We are not walking away from that. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1430.76s)]
*  My turn to ask a question. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1439.46s)]
*  I think the next question is Mary Bruce, ABC. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1441.46s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1445.96s)]
*  You recently launched your re-election campaign. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1447.3600000000001s)]
*  You've said questions about your age are legitimate and your response is always just watch me. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1450.16s)]
*  But the country is watching and recent polling shows that 70% of Americans, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1455.0600000000002s)]
*  including a majority of Democrats, believe you shouldn't run again. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1459.3600000000001s)]
*  What do you say to them? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1463.46s)]
*  What do you say to those Americans who are watching and aren't convinced? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1464.66s)]
*  You've said you can beat Trump again. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1468.66s)]
*  Do you think you're the only one? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1470.8600000000001s)]
*  I may not be the only one, but I know him well and I know the danger he presents to our democracy. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1472.96s)]
*  And we've been down this road before. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1480.46s)]
*  And with regard to age, you know, and polling data, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1482.8600000000001s)]
*  I noticed the polling data I keep hearing about is that I'm between 42 and 46% favorable rating, etc. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1487.8600000000001s)]
*  And but everybody running for re-election in this time has been in the same position. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1497.6599999999999s)]
*  There's nothing new about that. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1503.1599999999999s)]
*  We're making it sound like Biden's really underwater. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1504.1599999999999s)]
*  And number one. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1507.9599999999998s)]
*  Number two, when the same polling data ask whether they think what kind of job I've done, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1509.1599999999999s)]
*  it gets overwhelmingly positive results from 58% thinking and everything from the Chips Act and all the things we've done. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1514.56s)]
*  You know, we've created, like I said, we've created 12 million new jobs. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1523.26s)]
*  We've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1527.76s)]
*  We have economic growth moving. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1530.9599999999998s)]
*  We're in a situation where the climate, we've invested more money and more help in dealing with the climate crisis in any nation in the world. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1533.1599999999999s)]
*  And so things are moving. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1541.36s)]
*  And the reason I'm running again is there's a job to finish. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1543.56s)]
*  The other thing is that look, you know, think about what I inherited when I got elected. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1547.26s)]
*  I inherited a nation and overwhelming debt at the time. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1552.96s)]
*  Number one, in the hole for the four years that he was president. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1556.66s)]
*  I inherited a nation that had a serious loss of credibility around the world as America first. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1561.26s)]
*  And, you know, the first meeting I attended the G7, I said America's back. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1569.0600000000002s)]
*  And one of the world leaders looked and said, for how long? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1573.46s)]
*  For how long? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1575.8600000000001s)]
*  There's a great concern about the United States being able to lead the free world. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1576.96s)]
*  And we're doing that again. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1582.3600000000001s)]
*  And those same polls you look at and take a look at the polls are saying whether I pull together NATO and the European Union as well as Asian partners. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1584.06s)]
*  I think we have. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1593.26s)]
*  But there's more to do. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1594.66s)]
*  And with regard to age, I can't even say, I guess how old I am. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1595.96s)]
*  I can't even say the number. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1601.66s)]
*  It doesn't, it doesn't register with me. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1603.16s)]
*  And but the only thing I can say is that one of the things that people are going to find out is going to see a race and they're going to judge whether or not I have or don't have it. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1605.86s)]
*  I respect them taking a hard look at it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1616.56s)]
*  I take a hard look at it as well. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1618.56s)]
*  I took a hard look at it before I decided to run. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1620.36s)]
*  And I feel good. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1623.26s)]
*  I feel excited about the prospects. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1624.9599999999998s)]
*  And I think we're on the verge of really turning the corner in a way we haven't a long time. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1627.26s)]
*  I know you're tired of him. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1632.56s)]
*  I know. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1633.76s)]
*  You know, I'm tired of him. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1634.16s)]
*  I know. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1635.3600000000001s)]
*  I understand. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1636.46s)]
*  But I know in the end we're going to stay, we're going to stay. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1637.3600000000001s)]
*  We're going to say we're in inflection point, but we really are what happens in the next two, three, four years going to turn what the next three, four decades look like. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1639.5600000000002s)]
*  And I have never been more optimistic in my life about the possible of the United States. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1648.46s)]
*  To be clear, though, you just said I know him well. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1654.26s)]
*  Did Donald Trump's decision to run affect yours? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1656.3600000000001s)]
*  Would you be running if he wasn't? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1658.46s)]
*  You know him well, too. And the question is whether or not, look, there's just, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1660.26s)]
*  there's more to finish the job. We have an opportunity to put ourselves in a position [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1666.34s)]
*  where we are economically and politically secure for a long time. Look, we continue to have, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1671.7s)]
*  and now we don't like to hear me saying it, there's still a contest between autocracies [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1677.3s)]
*  and democracies. And we're the leading democracy in the world. And it's something I know a fair [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1681.86s)]
*  amount about, something I care about, and something that I have found a willingness [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1687.3s)]
*  an awful lot of our allies and friends to follow. So I think that, you know, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1692.98s)]
*  we have to finish the job and nail it down. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1698.26s)]
*  You need to repeat the question. The mic was not used. We could not interpret. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1718.18s)]
*  They need to repeat the question. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1730.18s)]
*  Please use the microphone. We cannot provide interpretation if you did not use the microphone. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1735.7s)]
*  My apologies. Thank you. Did the recent leaks revealing that the U.S. was spying on South [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1739.54s)]
*  Korea come up at all in your discussions? And did President Biden provide you any assurances? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1748.34s)]
*  With regard to that, we are communicating between our two countries and we are sharing [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1752.6599999999999s)]
*  necessary information. I believe that investigation is underway in the United States. So [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1770.8999999999999s)]
*  various and complex variables are always in play. We need time to wait for the investigation results [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1778.66s)]
*  by the United States. And we plan to continue to communicate on the matter. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1787.54s)]
*  This will be the last question. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1796.9s)]
*  I'm from Financial News. My name is Kim Hak-Jae. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1802.98s)]
*  My question goes to both of you. My first one goes to President Yoon first. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1805.38s)]
*  During the state visit, you've said that the alliance has strengthened to cutting edge [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1809.3000000000002s)]
*  industries, to cutting edge science, and also investments in businesses have been some of the [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1816.2600000000002s)]
*  outcomes. These are some positives, however, to each individual of the public. How will this have [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1823.3000000000002s)]
*  a long-term impact? What will be the direct benefits felt? Answer President Biden. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1829.54s)]
*  In celebration of the 70th anniversary of the ROK-U.S. alliance, I know that the atmosphere [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1842.42s)]
*  is really positive. However, Korean businesses, especially because of the Chips Act and the IRA, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1847.46s)]
*  are on edge. What message can you send to the Korean companies to really [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1854.6599999999999s)]
*  make sure and tell them that this is not something to worry about? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1861.86s)]
*  The technology cooperation between the ROK and the U.S. and also in partnerships in cutting [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1867.78s)]
*  edge industries and science and technology was your first question. So that is about really [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1873.1399999999999s)]
*  strengthening the competitiveness of our two countries. And it will enhance the productivity [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1878.98s)]
*  and create added value, high added value. These are the types of products that are going to be [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1885.94s)]
*  produced. And from the perspective of the public, for each individual in that process, they will [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1891.94s)]
*  reap the benefits wide and comprehensive that will stem from these industries and investments [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1899.22s)]
*  in these industries, for example, from job creation as well. And above all, the future [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1905.78s)]
*  generations will be given the determination and will to take on new challenges and [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1911.3799999999999s)]
*  embrace opportunities in our industry so that they can continue to prosper and grow [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1919.1399999999999s)]
*  and become more abundant in the future. The reassurance is that it's overwhelming [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1924.66s)]
*  in our interest for Korea to do well. No, it is. It's very much in America's interest that Korea [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1931.7s)]
*  do well in the Pacific. Very well. Because they are one of our most valued partners. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1938.5s)]
*  And so I think the combination of growing democracies in the democratic institutions as [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1944.5800000000002s)]
*  well as their economies is overwhelming in the benefit of the United States, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1950.3400000000001s)]
*  whether it is in South Korea or it's in Australia, in the deep South Pacific. And so I think that [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1954.9s)]
*  there's a reason, overwhelming reason. Plus, in addition to that, we're increasing the number of [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1961.3s)]
*  student exchanges, access to more information between our folks, educating our people, as well [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1966.18s)]
*  as we're going to be cooperating everything from space to technology to medicine. And so there's so [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1973.94s)]
*  many opportunities we have. And I don't think we, at least we don't, and I don't think so far, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1980.02s)]
*  most of the South Korean companies believe that there's somehow a U.S. effort to slow them down, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1986.5800000000002s)]
*  prevent their growth, or anything like that. We'd like to see them grow. And I mean that [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=1994.5s)]
*  sincerely. It's overwhelming in the U.S. interest for South Korea to do very well economically. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2000.18s)]
*  It's overwhelming in our interest because it has. And lastly, you know, I think we underestimate [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2006.9s)]
*  the example that South Korea sets. Here you have a nation that is significant but is not a nation of [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2012.02s)]
*  two, three, four hundred thousand people making the kind of changes it's making. It gives other [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2020.58s)]
*  smaller nations hope to believe that if they have democratic institutions and commitment and impact [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2025.86s)]
*  on industries that in fact are the cutting edge industries, new sciences and technology, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2032.5s)]
*  including AI and other things, that there's a future for them. And I think that's what this is [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2037.94s)]
*  about. And so we view South Korea's economic growth as a benefit to the United States as well as [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2042.9s)]
*  freedom around the world. Thank you all so very much. Appreciate it. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2053.14s)]
*  Distinguished guests, please remain in your seats until the official delegations have departed. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2060.42s)]
*  All right. We've been watching there as President Biden standing alongside South Korean President [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2066.02s)]
*  Yoon Suk-yul hold a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2070.42s)]
*  Just listening to President Biden there as he yelled something out. I didn't quite catch it. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2076.74s)]
*  But the two leaders here generally speaking about the importance. Let's just listen. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2081.22s)]
*  ...whether or not the debt limit gets extended. That's not negotiable. I notice they quote Reagan [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2085.14s)]
*  and they quote Reagan all the time and they quote Trump, both of which said, I'm paraphrasing, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2092.58s)]
*  it would be an absolute crime to not extend the debt limit. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2098.98s)]
*  All right. President Biden there making commentary on the domestic debate on extending [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2111.06s)]
*  the United States debt limit. He has to negotiate with Republicans in order to [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2119.06s)]
*  resolve that issue. No news made there. But generally, the U.S. president alongside the [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2122.5s)]
*  South Korean president were discussing the importance of a shared nuclear posture as they [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2128.1s)]
*  deal with North Korea. And as part of the discussion, the two leaders announcing the [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2134.18s)]
*  repositioning of U.S. nuclear subs in the region, President Biden said the decisions made as part of [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2139.86s)]
*  this state visit could have an impact on generations to come. President Yun said one [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2145.62s)]
*  of the goals for a meeting is to provide extended deterrence to the threat from North Korea. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2151.22s)]
*  That's right. And we also heard during the Q&A, the president shrugging off a question about [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2158.1s)]
*  poll numbers, saying a large number of people feel that he may be too old to run for president. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2162.58s)]
*  Mr. Biden dismissing that completely. Let's bring in CBS News senior White House and political [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2168.58s)]
*  correspondent Ed O'Keefe, who is there as we all see, enjoying the kind of nice weather, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2173.94s)]
*  but also listening closely to what these world leaders are saying. Ed, what's notable is [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2178.58s)]
*  President Yun earlier this year did float the possibility of South Korea developing its own [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2183.06s)]
*  nukes if the threat from the North worsened. So how do we get to this announcement today? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2187.94s)]
*  The South Korea is saying, never mind, we're going to rely on the United States. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2192.98s)]
*  Because the United States committed to at least having nuclear or nuclear armed submarines [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2197.06s)]
*  dock and port visit, depending on the vernacular that officials use, in South Korea for the first [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2204.9s)]
*  time essentially since the 1980s in a far more dramatic and apparent attempt to counter the [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2211.78s)]
*  potential nuclear threats from North Korea. So that's part of today's announcement, at least. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2218.66s)]
*  This visit has been scheduled for quite some time, seen as a key relationship that has to be fostered [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2225.54s)]
*  and has to be respected. And so the South Korean leader today is getting the full trappings of a [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2232.2599999999998s)]
*  state visit. There was the formal arrival earlier. There's a state dinner later tonight where hundreds [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2237.62s)]
*  of guests are expected to gather. And there is that agreement that was announced that the U.S. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2242.5s)]
*  military at least will make visits. The U.S. Navy will park its submarines there in South Korean [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2247.46s)]
*  ports to try to deter the North Koreans. Now they've responded saying that's a dramatic escalation. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2254.02s)]
*  They're not happy about it. And we'll see whether there's any other response from Russia or other [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2258.82s)]
*  countries in the region to this. But it is in part designed to stem or perhaps dissuade South Korea [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2264.42s)]
*  from developing its own nuclear capabilities because the last thing the world wants, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2271.2200000000003s)]
*  at least in the views of the United States, is another nuclear power. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2275.2200000000003s)]
*  So Ed, you mentioned North Korea already sort of responded to this. President Biden said [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2279.6200000000003s)]
*  he's going to continue to seek diplomatic breakthroughs with North Korea. What does [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2288.74s)]
*  today's declaration say about where these talks are? Is diplomacy still alive? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2297.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, U.S. officials would say they're trying, but there hasn't been any real meaningful [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2302.58s)]
*  diplomatic engagement between the two countries that we're aware of that administration [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2308.02s)]
*  officials have signaled at all over the course of the Biden administration. So by doing what they're [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2312.3399999999997s)]
*  doing today, at least, it's a signal to North Korea of how seriously the United States takes the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2318.26s)]
*  threat. But at the same time, they're, of course, expressing a willingness to keep talking. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2322.7400000000002s)]
*  The president was asked here in the last few minutes about recent polling, including CBS [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2328.34s)]
*  News polling, showing American voters are concerned about his age. He is 80. He will be running. He's [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2333.0600000000004s)]
*  running for president again, making him the oldest sitting president. And Democrats who are reluctant [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2337.94s)]
*  to support him. How did Mr. Biden respond? Well, it was notable. These are his first extended [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2342.6600000000003s)]
*  comments on the issue of age since the latest round of polling has suggested there is great [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2348.02s)]
*  concern, not only among Americans overall, but notably among Democrats, that perhaps because [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2353.06s)]
*  of his age, he would be 82 by Election Day 2024, that he perhaps is just too old to do this. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2358.66s)]
*  The answer that he gave or the answer he's given in the past is watch me, meaning see me do the [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2367.38s)]
*  job. And if you've got any concern, you can vote otherwise. But persistently and most recently, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2373.06s)]
*  age now is the big reason why there is reluctance or at least morose acceptance of the fact that [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2380.42s)]
*  he's going to do this. And so hearing him today suggests that first of all, he's mired in the [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2386.58s)]
*  40s. Look, it depends on the poll. 46% may be a little generous. We have seen polling that [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2391.54s)]
*  suggests it's closer to 41, high 30s. And on certain issues, it can be lower than that. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2396.18s)]
*  But what he's also saying is I've got some time and he's not wrong about that. There's still more [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2402.02s)]
*  than a year to go. He has the Democratic field at least all to himself. And so he'll allow [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2406.1800000000003s)]
*  Republicans to fight it out in a primary on their side. Well, he can continue making the argument [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2411.06s)]
*  to people that he should be reelected. One other thing about this reelection, he is doing something [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2415.46s)]
*  literally today that many other incumbent presidents seeking reelection have done. They are adopting [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2422.1800000000003s)]
*  what's called the Rose Garden strategy. In essence, just keep doing the job and do it in [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2428.74s)]
*  a higher profile way. Show people that you're doing the job and hopefully they'll like that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2434.02s)]
*  Well, here we are literally in the Rose Garden today. He's hosting a world leader and he's [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2439.06s)]
*  making use of that strategy. And we've been told by campaign aides, by White House officials, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2444.8999999999996s)]
*  that at least in the coming weeks, that's the plan. To in essence keep their heads down, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2449.62s)]
*  have him keep doing the day job, focus on raising money and eventually get out there in campaign. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2453.78s)]
*  But if he can keep doing the job the way he's been doing it while Republicans are squabbling [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2461.0600000000004s)]
*  amongst themselves while he's, as he mentioned there at the end, fighting with the House speaker [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2465.86s)]
*  over whether or not to raise the debt limit, they believe his poll numbers will improve as Americans [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2469.46s)]
*  look at the contrast and say they like the president what he's been up to. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2474.34s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe, thank you very much. Next on CBS News. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2478.02s)]
*  We'll take a look at the 75th anniversary of Israel's independence and how it's being [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2484.26s)]
*  marked here in the United States. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3JCVEOJYdk&t=2488.26s)]
