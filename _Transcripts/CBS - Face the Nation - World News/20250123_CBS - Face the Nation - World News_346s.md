# Trump tells world leaders at Davos to invest in U.S. or face tariffs
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c)
*  My message to every business in the world is very simple. Come make your product in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=0.0s)]
*  America and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=5.0s)]
*  That was President Donald Trump's pitch to leaders at the World Economic Forum in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=10.56s)]
*  Davos, Switzerland. He's threatening tariffs if they don't make their products in the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=15.08s)]
*  United States. David Wessel joins us now. He is a senior fellow in economic studies [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=18.84s)]
*  at the Brookings Institution. Great to see you. Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=22.6s)]
*  What does the president make of President Trump and his threat of tariffs? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=26.36s)]
*  Well, President Trump goes to Davos, which is a gathering of business elites from all [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=29.36s)]
*  over the world and gives a US-style America first speech. So I think it's, given that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=36.8s)]
*  we need alliances in order to compete with China, it's sort of strange. I don't quite [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=44.04s)]
*  understand how this is going to work. He doesn't yet have congressional support for cutting [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=48.36s)]
*  the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. So it struck me as a lot of Trump bluster. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=53.92s)]
*  And my principle these days is watch what he does, not what he says. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=59.72s)]
*  So what do you make in terms of how other nations are going to respond to this? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  What's the reality of how not only nations but companies are going to handle this tariff [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=70.6s)]
*  program coming forward? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=78.44s)]
*  Well, we don't really know exactly what he is going to do on tariffs. As you know, he [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=80.6s)]
*  has a lot of authority. He can do tariffs without Congress. We know from the last time [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=85.0s)]
*  that there are lots of exemptions. It doesn't work to impose tariffs on things that we don't [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=89.24s)]
*  already make here. All that does is raise the price of what we pay. And other countries [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=94.48s)]
*  aren't going to sit idly by. Other countries, Canada, Mexico, have already begun talking [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=99.08s)]
*  about, well, you put tariffs on us, we're going to put tariffs on you, and that'll just [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=104.64s)]
*  hurt our exporters. So it looks like we're in for some pretty tense times. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=109.72s)]
*  One thing that really struck me about Davos was the Chinese vice premier spoke, and he [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  was all about the virtues of globalization and everything. It was kind of bizarre to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=119.84s)]
*  have the Chinese talking about the virtues of globalization and Donald Trump talking [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=124.08s)]
*  about America first. It proves that cynicism is not limited to one country. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=128.52s)]
*  When you look at economic policy, there's also the Federal Reserve and monetary policy [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  that's part of that conversation. President Trump is threatening to try to lower interest [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  rates. Is that possible, or is the Fed independent at this point? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=147.92s)]
*  The Fed is independent at this point. He really doesn't have any control over what the Fed [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=152.76s)]
*  does until he can replace Jay Powell in the spring of 2026 as the Fed chair. And I think [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  he's going to make it hard for whoever Powell's successor is, because if the successor is [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=164.76s)]
*  seen as someone who will do Trump's bidding, then he's not only going to have resistance [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=169.76s)]
*  from inside the Fed, but it's going to push up the interest rates in the bond market. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  One thing that the president didn't talk about is, or he mentioned it, but not really well [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=178.89999999999998s)]
*  on it, is what does all this mean for the federal debt? And to the extent that the federal [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=183.92s)]
*  debt is going to be worse than projected, that's going to, A, push up long-term interest [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=187.94s)]
*  rates, and B, it's going to make the Fed reluctant to cut interest rates further. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=193.32s)]
*  Tariffs will add to the pressure on the Fed, which is worried about bringing inflation [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=197.16s)]
*  down to its target. So I look at that as an early warning sign for the Fed that Trump [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=201.68s)]
*  is going to be beating up on them, and we'll see whether the Fed continues to have the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=206.32s)]
*  backbone to stand up to him, if that's what they think is the right economic policy for [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=210.52s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of the world economy's reaction to President Trump so far? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=216.56s)]
*  That's a good question. I think they're kind of, they've been preparing for this, so they're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  not surprised. I think they're gearing up to fight back. And I think that you're beginning [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  to see some efforts, which are not necessarily in our interest, to have alliances that cut [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  out the U.S. EU-Mexico recently did a trade deal. I think the Chinese are looking at this [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  and saying, like, great, we've been trying to divide and conquer the West for some time, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=246.16s)]
*  and now we have an ally in Donald Trump. So I think they're looking at this with a great [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=250.82s)]
*  deal of trepidation. I do think businesses are afraid of Trump. I'm sure some of them [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=255.14s)]
*  are going to move production here because they want to get ahead of tariffs. The businessmen [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=260.3s)]
*  who were on the panel at Davos were, I wouldn't say they were confrontational in the least. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=266.2s)]
*  They all seem to be a bit afraid of him. But I do think people are waiting to see what [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=271.9s)]
*  I think they've learned that he sometimes talks more loudly than he actually acts. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=276.86s)]
*  And then finally, tax reform or tax cuts are on the horizon now on Capitol Hill. Is that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=282.66s)]
*  something that your sources in the economic community are paying close attention to? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=290.66s)]
*  Yeah, you bet. So look, we all expect the individual tax cuts that were in the Tax Cut [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=294.26s)]
*  and Jobs Act of 2017, which expire at the end of this year, to be extended. That's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=300.54s)]
*  pretty much baked in. Everybody anticipates that. The question is, what more will they [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=306.46000000000004s)]
*  do and what will that do to projections of the federal debt? And I think that President [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=310.74s)]
*  Trump may, it's easy for him to say, I'm going to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=316.82000000000005s)]
*  but unless he can get Congress to go along, it's just nothing more than rhetoric. And [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=321.98s)]
*  at this point, I don't think Congress is ready to cut taxes as much as he is talking [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=326.94s)]
*  about, but maybe that's his usual bargaining position and he'll settle for something less. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=331.9s)]
*  David Wessel, a veteran reporter and now analyst of these issues, we really appreciate you [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=337.7s)]
*  taking the time and sharing your expertise. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAUir1ZnK2c&t=343.26s)]
