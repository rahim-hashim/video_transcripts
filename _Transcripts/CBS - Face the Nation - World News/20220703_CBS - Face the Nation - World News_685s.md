# Germany's Scholz defends handling of aid to Ukraine
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM)
*  Last week, we traveled to Madrid to speak with the new chancellor of Germany, Olaf [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=0.0s)]
*  Scholz, during a week of international meetings among top U.S. allies who are faced with a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=4.16s)]
*  growing list of problems, including rising food and energy prices exacerbated by Russia's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=9.28s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=15.44s)]
*  Chancellor Scholz is one of the few European leaders who still speaks to Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=17.68s)]
*  So that's where we started our conversation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=23.04s)]
*  When you speak to Putin, does he acknowledge the sanctions? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=26.3s)]
*  Does he acknowledge how much his economy has been hurt? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=29.52s)]
*  Or does he just not care? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=32.24s)]
*  I think he cares, but he will not really admit it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=33.86s)]
*  So you get some idea that it really is hurting him and that he understands the deep impacts [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=36.32s)]
*  of our sanctions on his economy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=44.56s)]
*  And I'm always mentioning it because it's necessary to say it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  This is now happening to a country that is not that advanced, that is really needing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=50.42s)]
*  all the technologies from the rest of the world for having a similar standard of living [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=57.76s)]
*  and for having the chance to be part of growth in the world economy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=62.96s)]
*  And this is now the real damage to the Russian economy that they have no chance to do this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=67.52s)]
*  When will Putin run out of weapons, run out of funds? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=72.6s)]
*  Or can this continue for years? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=75.4s)]
*  No one really knows. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=77.84s)]
*  He is the leader of a very great country with a lot of people living there, with a lot of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=78.84s)]
*  means, and he is really doing this brutal war with and he prepared for it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=87.76s)]
*  So he will be able to continue with the war really a long time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=95.12s)]
*  Do you believe that Vladimir Putin will stop at Ukraine? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=99.66s)]
*  I think that all what we do will help to give him the view that this is not working and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  that he will not be successful. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=110.64s)]
*  Your country has earned this reputation of over-promising and under-delivering when it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=113.2s)]
*  comes to Ukraine. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=117.84s)]
*  Ukraine received its very first delivery of German howitzers, its artillery, last week. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=119.56s)]
*  Why did it take that long? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=125.4s)]
*  We're in the fifth month. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=127.12s)]
*  So we took a very, very hard decision to change political strategies we followed for many [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  decades, never to deliver weapons into a country that is in a conflict. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=135.12s)]
*  When we decided, for instance, to send the most modern howitzer, which you can buy on [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=139.64s)]
*  the world market, which is in use in Germany, it was very difficult to organize that this [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=144.68s)]
*  could be used in the war because you have to have some training. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=152.24s)]
*  And we had Ukrainian soldiers in Germany and when the training ended, in the end they came [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  with the weapon, with the howitzers to Ukraine and they are now in use. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=162.32s)]
*  But the United States is doing that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=166.04s)]
*  You're providing weaponry within 48 hours sometimes of the president signing and carrying [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=167.56s)]
*  out training. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=172.8s)]
*  Why did it take this long for Germany? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=173.8s)]
*  I think you should understand that there is a difference if a country like the United [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=175.6s)]
*  States spends that much for defense, which is a very big investment, and you have a lot [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=179.32s)]
*  of weapons at your stocks. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=188.0s)]
*  Together with the United States and the United Kingdom, we decided to deliver multi-rocket [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=189.96s)]
*  launches to Ukraine now, which are... [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=197.84s)]
*  Those haven't been delivered yet. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  We are sending them and we are doing it with the means and ways we have and with the training. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=202.36s)]
*  And once again, there are a lot of very experienced people who yesterday looked at Google and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=207.68s)]
*  today they know how to do things. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=213.44s)]
*  I will tell you, there are weapons where you have to have your training and you have to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=216.04s)]
*  have it not in Ukraine, you have to have it here in our countries. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=220.72s)]
*  And so we will always see that Germany is one of the countries that is doing the most [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=225.56s)]
*  because what we are sending now is the most sophisticated technology you can use. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=231.6s)]
*  There is also... [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=237.36s)]
*  There are also weapons we give to Ukraine that they can defend the air. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=242.24s)]
*  The anti-aircraft missiles you promised? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=249.4s)]
*  Radar? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=251.4s)]
*  No, they can defend a city against the rockets and missiles that were sent there from Putin. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=252.4s)]
*  And this is very expensive and very effective technology, but they will get it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=260.32s)]
*  The delays have led to speculation that it's not about getting the supplies, it's about [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=265.12s)]
*  the will of the government to actually deliver them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=270.0s)]
*  And whether there's fear of provoking Putin or whether it's years of budget cuts to your [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=273.64s)]
*  defense industry that have made it just not possible for the German military to act quickly. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=278.32s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=284.16s)]
*  Those who are looking to the facts see that we are doing what is feasible. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=286.32s)]
*  We are changing the way how we spend money for defense. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=290.92s)]
*  And this is the big increase which will change the situation and will give us the chance [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=294.76s)]
*  to be more quick in reaction to a threat that is coming to NATO, the alliance or to our [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=299.86s)]
*  country. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=305.48s)]
*  Germany is providing about two billion in aid to Ukraine. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=306.48s)]
*  That's roughly what you spend per month on gas from Russia, on coal, on energy supplies. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=310.72s)]
*  So while you're helping the Ukrainians financially, you're also essentially giving Vladimir Putin [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=317.84s)]
*  a financial lifeline. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=323.41999999999996s)]
*  He cannot buy anything from the money he's getting from us because he has all these sanctions [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  on imports for modern technologies and things he is looking for. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=331.08s)]
*  So this is what is making him very angry. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=335.12s)]
*  But to be very clear, when we decided on sanctions together and with all our allies, we said [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=337.23999999999995s)]
*  always, we will do it in a way that we harm Putin more than us. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=342.76s)]
*  And many countries in Europe are depending for historical reasons and because they are [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=347.28s)]
*  near to the place and it is the nearest place to get the gas on the imports of gas. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=352.56s)]
*  And when now whole Europe is deciding to go out of this dependence, this will change the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=358.2s)]
*  scenario even on the world market. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=363.76s)]
*  But Vladimir Putin can use that money elsewhere, just not in the West. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  Is it still two billion a month that Germany is sending to Russia? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=370.96s)]
*  It is always decreasing and we draft the sanctions in a way that they hurt Putin and this is [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=374.6s)]
*  what we do. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  And once again, we are now doing real investments into technology in pipelines, in ports. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=380.68s)]
*  And I know there are people that sometimes think that when you are having taken a decision [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=388.76000000000005s)]
*  one afternoon, the next morning you have a port and a 40-kilometre pipeline. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=395.0s)]
*  But in the real life, this is not happening. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=399.36s)]
*  When Europe is deciding to go out of the import of gas from Russia, this will have consequences. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=402.68s)]
*  This is the equivalent of them declaring war on you by cutting gas supplies to Germany. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=412.0s)]
*  This isn't just your choice. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=417.8s)]
*  They're using that as a weapon against you. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=419.24s)]
*  This is obviously the case and this is why I was starting to discuss the question what [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=421.0s)]
*  to do if the gas delivery will be reduced right when I entered office. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=425.68s)]
*  We should be very much prepared that we will have high energy prices all over the world [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=431.16s)]
*  in all countries. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=436.16s)]
*  So Germany's heavy industry association, BDI, warned a halt in Russian gas deliveries would [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=437.56s)]
*  make recession inevitable. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=443.6s)]
*  It will be very tough if we will have a shortage of energy supplies. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=446.04s)]
*  Obviously all our countries, all our life is depending on the supply of energy. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=452.04s)]
*  But obviously a lot of countries, the most countries of the world are depending on the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=458.52s)]
*  supply from abroad. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=462.76s)]
*  And so we have to prepare for a difficult situation. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=464.6s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is weaponizing inflation. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=467.36s)]
*  He's weaponizing food. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=470.12s)]
*  Is he right to bet that he can fracture the Western alliance by making it harder for Europeans [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=473.16s)]
*  and Americans and everyone else to afford food in these months ahead? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=480.76s)]
*  You are very right. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=485.08s)]
*  The shortages of food many people in the world are seeing now as a threat to them are the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=486.76000000000005s)]
*  direct consequence of Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the war he is imposing [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=496.44000000000005s)]
*  on the country. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=501.48s)]
*  You are right that all the rising energy prices are also a direct consequence of his doing. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=502.48s)]
*  And he is the one that is doing the wrong things. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=510.88000000000005s)]
*  And we are always discussing this with our partners on the globe. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=514.84s)]
*  We are starting an initiative to support countries that have not enough food with food. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=519.0400000000001s)]
*  If you can't reopen the Black Sea ports and Putin doesn't agree to let the food out of [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=528.08s)]
*  Ukraine, how do you lower global food prices? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=531.84s)]
*  We are now collecting money for supporting the poorest countries that they will be able [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  to deliver food to their people. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=542.2800000000001s)]
*  This is our international initiative. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=544.52s)]
*  We organize together with others for food security and we will continue to do that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=546.88s)]
*  But it risks global instability. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=553.36s)]
*  It is a real problem and it is a real consequence of Putin's war. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  And this is why it is even more necessary that we support the people. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=560.28s)]
*  So it also puts pressure to end this conflict sooner. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=564.88s)]
*  What is your timeline for when this can end? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=571.12s)]
*  The conflict will end when Putin understands that he will not be successful with the idea [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=574.88s)]
*  to conquer part of the territory of his neighbor. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  Members of the German government have admitted it was a mistake to be so dependent on Russia [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=583.44s)]
*  for so long. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=588.08s)]
*  I think it was not right that we were not prepared to have at any time the chance to [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=589.24s)]
*  change the one that is delivering gas, oil and coal to us. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=595.24s)]
*  So we should have invested all over Europe in an infrastructure that gives us the ability [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=600.96s)]
*  to change the supply from one day to the other. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=606.64s)]
*  And I think this is the lesson that has been learned in Europe and in many other places [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=610.9200000000001s)]
*  that you have to be prepared for a situation like this. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=615.88s)]
*  President Biden also talks about this potential conflict between democracies and autocracies. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=620.6s)]
*  Is that the biggest threat on the horizon? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=627.6s)]
*  We should be clear about the threats that are coming to our future. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=631.44s)]
*  And this is coming from autocracies, yes, because they tend to be aggressive. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=636.4s)]
*  And this is an aspect we should be very much aware of. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=641.32s)]
*  And I am. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=645.52s)]
*  And this is why I organized our meeting we had in Germany with the D7 group of economically [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=646.88s)]
*  successful democratic states that we invite partners from all over the globe that are [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=656.6s)]
*  also democracies for making it happen that the democracies are strong. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=662.6s)]
*  And by strong, it also comes with 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe and 300,000 NATO response [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=668.52s)]
*  forces in Europe. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=675.28s)]
*  This isn't just diplomacy. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=676.96s)]
*  This is muscle. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=678.34s)]
*  This is, and it's necessary. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=679.34s)]
*  Mr. Chancellor, thank you for your time this morning. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=682.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxaHo49PVsM&t=684.6s)]
