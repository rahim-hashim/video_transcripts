# U.K. general election to be held on July 4, Rishi Sunak says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas)
*  All right, we've got some breaking news for you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=0.0s)]
*  You see British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak there [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=2.6s)]
*  outside at number 10 Downing Street [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=4.68s)]
*  announcing a general election in the UK. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=9.28s)]
*  You met that challenge and then some. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  And I have never been prouder to be British. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=12.8s)]
*  And when I introduced the furlough scheme, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=15.8s)]
*  I did so not because I saw a country [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  simply in need of desperate help, albeit we were, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  but because I saw a country whose future hung in the balance. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=23.72s)]
*  I could be bold and trust [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=27.64s)]
*  in the tens of millions of you at home [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=28.92s)]
*  that you would rise to the moment, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  or I could accept the inevitable, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=32.96s)]
*  millions of job losses and pick up the pieces. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=34.6s)]
*  In truth, it was no choice at all. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=38.24s)]
*  I have never and will never leave the people of this country [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=41.44s)]
*  to face the darkest of days alone. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=44.96s)]
*  And you know that because you've seen it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=47.52s)]
*  As I did then, I will forever do everything in my power [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=50.64s)]
*  to provide you with the strongest possible protection I can. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=54.64s)]
*  That is my promise to you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=58.76s)]
*  Because for so many of us, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=61.32s)]
*  it's easy to forget the scale of what we've been through. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=63.08s)]
*  We were hit by a pandemic that upended normal life. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=66.36s)]
*  Who would have thought that the government [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=70.12s)]
*  would ever tell us how many times a day [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=71.44s)]
*  we could leave our homes? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=73.28s)]
*  Then just as we were recovering from COVID, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=75.32s)]
*  war returned to Europe, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=77.96s)]
*  with Putin's invasion of Ukraine [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=79.92s)]
*  sending your energy bills spiralling. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=81.44s)]
*  I came to office above all to restore economic stability. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=84.16s)]
*  Economic stability is the bedrock of any future success, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  whether that is rising wages and good jobs, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=93.4s)]
*  investment in our public services, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=96.0s)]
*  or the defence of the country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=98.12s)]
*  And because of our collective sacrifice and your hard work, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=100.84s)]
*  we have reached two major milestones [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=104.2s)]
*  in delivering that stability, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=106.12s)]
*  showing that when we work together, anything is possible. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  Our economy is now growing faster than anyone predicted, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  outpacing Germany, France and the United States. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=116.44000000000001s)]
*  And this morning it was confirmed [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  that inflation is back to normal. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=121.28s)]
*  This means that the pressure on prices will ease [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  and mortgage rates will come down. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=126.44000000000001s)]
*  This is proof that the plan and priorities I set out [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=129.4s)]
*  are working. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  I recognise that it has not always been easy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=133.84s)]
*  Some of you will only just be starting to feel the benefits, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  and for some, it might still be hard [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=140.16s)]
*  when you look at your bank balance. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=142.6s)]
*  But this hard-earned economic stability [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=145.04s)]
*  was only ever meant to be the beginning. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=146.76s)]
*  The question now is how and who do you trust [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=149.2s)]
*  to turn that foundation into a secure future [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=153.12s)]
*  for you, your family and our country? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=155.56s)]
*  Now is the moment for Britain to choose its future, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=159.16s)]
*  to decide whether we want to build [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  on the progress we have made [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  or risk going back to square one [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  with no plan and no certainty. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  Earlier today, I spoke with His Majesty the King [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  to request the dissolution of Parliament. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=174.04s)]
*  The King has granted this request, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=176.64s)]
*  and we will have a general election on the 4th of July. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=178.64s)]
*  This election will take place at a time [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=182.28s)]
*  when the world is more dangerous [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=184.04s)]
*  than it has been since the end of the Cold War. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=185.84s)]
*  Putin's Russia is waging a brutal war in Ukraine [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=188.48s)]
*  and will not stop there if he succeeds. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=191.56s)]
*  That war has also made it all too clear [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=194.04s)]
*  the risk to our energy security. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=196.52s)]
*  In the Middle East, the forces of Islamist extremism [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=199.24s)]
*  threaten regional and ultimately global stability. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=202.32s)]
*  These tensions are exploited by extremists [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=206.36s)]
*  who seek to undermine our values [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=208.4s)]
*  and divide our society here at home. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  China is looking to dominate the 21st century [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=213.0s)]
*  by stealing the lead in technology, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=216.08s)]
*  and migration is being weaponized by hostile states [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=218.6s)]
*  to threaten the integrity of our borders. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=222.36s)]
*  These uncertain times call for a clear plan [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=225.6s)]
*  and bold action to chart a course to a secure future. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  You must choose in this election who has that plan, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  who is prepared to take the bold action necessary [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=237.2s)]
*  to secure a better future for our country and our children. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=240.0s)]
*  Now, I cannot and will not claim [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=244.76s)]
*  that we have got everything right. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=247.72s)]
*  No government should. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=249.76s)]
*  But I am proud of what we have achieved together, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=251.76s)]
*  the bold actions we have taken. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=254.48s)]
*  All right, a noisy day outside of 10 Downing Street [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=257.16s)]
*  as we watched UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=260.08000000000004s)]
*  announcing a general election on the 4th of July. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=262.64000000000004s)]
*  That is a bit of a surprise announcement that he had there. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=266.48s)]
*  He said, I have never and will never leave the people [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=270.44000000000005s)]
*  to face the darkest days alone. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  Really at issue there, the economy and inflation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=275.16s)]
*  That's right, and you notice because he is standing outside [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=278.0s)]
*  and the weather is very English at the moment, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=280.76000000000005s)]
*  he's getting soaked. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  I would imagine the British press [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=283.56s)]
*  is gonna have a field day with that, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=285.12s)]
*  considering his Conservative Party [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=286.44s)]
*  isn't doing well in the polls, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  and he's really up against it at the moment, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=290.32s)]
*  which is why he's having to announce this special election. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=292.44s)]
*  We're gonna bring in now CBS News foreign correspondent, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=296.48s)]
*  Ian Lee. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=298.48s)]
*  He's been following these developments for us from London. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=299.32s)]
*  So Ian, as Errol just mentioned, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=302.16s)]
*  his party, the Conservative Party, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=305.64s)]
*  which has been in power for the last 14 years, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  not doing so well right now. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=310.64s)]
*  So what do we know about the timing of this election? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=312.6s)]
*  And just to put maybe a fine point on it, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=315.12s)]
*  according to The Guardian, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=318.24s)]
*  the Labour Party is ahead by 20 points right now. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=319.72s)]
*  Yeah, it was interesting listening [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  to Rishi Sunak talk there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  You guys pointed out there were protesters [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=328.36s)]
*  outside 10 Downing Street. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=330.68s)]
*  That was the noise that you were hearing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  But this is a Prime Minister who really wanted to say [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  that he is a safe pair of hands going into this election. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=339.04s)]
*  Now, an election has to be held [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=343.6s)]
*  before the end of their five-year term. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=345.52s)]
*  So that means it has to be held by January of next year. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=347.96s)]
*  But it is up to the Prime Minister [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=352.44s)]
*  to decide when there will be an election, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=354.44s)]
*  what date that will be. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=357.2s)]
*  Rishi Sunak likely got his cabinet together. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=358.8s)]
*  They talked about it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=361.24s)]
*  That's when he made that decision. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=362.24s)]
*  But there's a couple things when making this sort [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=364.96s)]
*  of announcement first. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=368.12s)]
*  He'll want to see how, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=369.84s)]
*  they'll contemplate how the opposition will respond. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=371.12s)]
*  He'll want to put them at a disadvantage. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=373.84s)]
*  He'll also want to take the mood of the country, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=375.47999999999996s)]
*  what's happening in July at the time, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=377.52s)]
*  what bills they can get through parliament [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=379.76s)]
*  before that election. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=381.88s)]
*  But as you pointed out, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=383.56s)]
*  he is on the back foot at the moment [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  that the Labour Party is just trouncing them [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=387.28s)]
*  in local elections. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=389.68s)]
*  And it's expected that the Conservative Party will lose [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=391.08s)]
*  really resoundly in this next general election. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  And just to give a sense, Ian, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=399.0s)]
*  of the British attitude toward his party, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  he was preceded by Liz Truss, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=403.92s)]
*  who had what is best described as a disastrous, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=406.56s)]
*  short 49 days as Prime Minister. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=410.12s)]
*  I think the press was mocking her [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=413.36s)]
*  and saying she was outlasted by a cabbage, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=415.16s)]
*  which was kind of a live look at a cabbage that- [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=417.56s)]
*  They did have that live look of the cabbage. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=419.44s)]
*  That lasted longer than the previous Prime Minister. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=420.76s)]
*  Yeah, they had that streaming there, that cabbage. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=422.6s)]
*  So generally speaking, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=425.88s)]
*  what is the attitude there in the UK [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  toward the Conservatives, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=429.64s)]
*  and what opportunity does this provide for Labour, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=430.84s)]
*  considering they're doing well in local polling right now? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=432.88s)]
*  I mean, frankly, it does look like Labour's going to win [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=436.88s)]
*  this next general election. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=440.79999999999995s)]
*  They are going to be contesting 650 seats, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=442.76s)]
*  and Labour is well ahead in the polls. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  And so that looks like we will have [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  a Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=451.91999999999996s)]
*  he is the head of the Labour Party, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=453.76000000000005s)]
*  but the Conservatives are deeply unpopular. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=456.48s)]
*  But they've been in power since 2010. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=458.56s)]
*  That's a long time for any party to be in power. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=461.16s)]
*  So you'll likely have a kind of pushback to that, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=464.36s)]
*  especially you had the pandemic, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=467.92s)]
*  you had tough times with the economy. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=469.6s)]
*  And that's something that Rishi Sunak was talking about, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=472.12s)]
*  that he's been able to right the economy, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=475.32000000000005s)]
*  get it out of recession, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=478.36s)]
*  get growth in it and cut inflation, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=480.12s)]
*  and things he'll want to champion on. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=482.24s)]
*  But it has been a rough time. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=483.8s)]
*  And just talking to people, they want fresh blood, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  they want fresh ideas. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=489.47999999999996s)]
*  And so really, Rishi Sunak, as you pointed out, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=490.76s)]
*  Liz Truss, he took over from her, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=494.2s)]
*  she had a disastrous time in office. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=496.64s)]
*  Boris Johnson, also a very controversial Prime Minister. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=499.28s)]
*  So he really was kind of not so much leading the ship, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=504.03999999999996s)]
*  but kind of guiding it as it was sinking. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=507.52s)]
*  A lot of people didn't believe [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=510.08s)]
*  that the conservatives really could win [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=511.6s)]
*  the next general election. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=513.4s)]
*  The polls suggest that they won't. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=515.08s)]
*  All right, Ian Lee, thank you. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=517.64s)]
*  Thanks, Ian. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fCLbyCJas&t=519.24s)]
