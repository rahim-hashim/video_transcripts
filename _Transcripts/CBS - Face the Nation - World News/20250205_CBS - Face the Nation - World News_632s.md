# Trump’s plan to “take over” Gaza sparks surprise and questions
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow)
*  Hello, I'm Robert Costa in Washington. Tonight on America Decides, Mideast reaction, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=0.0s)]
*  Arab nations now rejecting President Trump's plan, his proposal to take over Gaza and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=4.88s)]
*  turn it to what he says could be the Riviera of the Middle East. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=9.68s)]
*  But the president, he is reiterating his position. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=13.16s)]
*  Everybody loves it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=16.76s)]
*  It's a demolition site right now. It's not a livable place for any human being. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=18.76s)]
*  And I think it's actually quite evil to suggest that people should live in such dire conditions. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=21.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, here in Washington, USAID in limbo, nearly all staff for the agency being placed on leave. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=27.48s)]
*  By Friday night, lawmakers and former workers there rallied on Capitol Hill today demanding answers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=33.48s)]
*  Plus alarm bells, Democrats are raising concerns over Elon Musk and his groups reviewing the Treasury Department's payment systems. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=38.8s)]
*  The department is pushing back, saying the billionaires team has only, quote, read-only access. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=46.28s)]
*  So you see in this tension, a lot of tension between the Treasury Department, outside observers, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=52.64s)]
*  and what's going on there with billionaire Elon Musk. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=57.76s)]
*  On all of this, let's start tonight with CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=60.16s)]
*  and CBS News congressional correspondent Caitlin Huey Burns. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=65.52s)]
*  Ed, beginning with you, thanks for being here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=69.48s)]
*  With criticism coming in from across the Middle East, how is President Trump planning on getting this done? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=71.72s)]
*  Is it a real proposal or not? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=76.2s)]
*  Well, Robert, we tried again today to get a little more detail and essentially all the White House will say, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=79.76s)]
*  at least so far, is that the president is trying to introduce some out of the box ideas [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=85.76s)]
*  that might eventually get the world behind some kind of rebuild plan for Gaza. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=90.92s)]
*  Notably, she reiterated today that the president hasn't yet considered or taken off the table [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=95.48s)]
*  the idea of U.S. military involvement in Gaza to protect that zone or to clear it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  And after the president yesterday suggested the permanent resettlement of people from the Gaza Strip, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=106.44000000000001s)]
*  today she suggested they might be temporarily relocated while the Strip was rebuilt. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, how would that work? Where would they go? How much would it cost to rebuild it? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=117.2s)]
*  Who would have to pay for that rebuilding and who would have to pay, if anything, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=121.28s)]
*  once they came back to the Gaza Strip should people decide to do so? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=125.48s)]
*  All of that remains unanswered. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=129.12s)]
*  But the broader goal, of course, of the Trump administration is to get a resolution [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=130.44s)]
*  to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas and to begin the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=135.0s)]
*  as is the goal of a lot of the world. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  You noticed, of course, the Israeli leader was here yesterday. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  Egypt's leaders here in the coming days, as is the Japanese prime minister, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  the vice president, is headed to Europe. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=148.8s)]
*  And through all of those conversations, we're expected to see attempts made to come up with some kind of plan [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=150.96s)]
*  that might eventually lead to exactly how it is the war would end and then how the rebuilding would begin. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=156.88s)]
*  Caitlin Huey-Burns, good to see you. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=163.6s)]
*  We saw many Republican lawmakers responding to President Trump's proposal. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=165.4s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=168.84s)]
*  That area is so dangerous and he's taking bold, decisive action to try to ensure the peace of that region. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=171.8s)]
*  It's a bold move, certainly, far bolder than what's been done before. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  What the president's really trying to say is we've got to do things differently in Gaza. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=182.84s)]
*  And one thing we can't have for a long term safe Gaza is Hamas. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=187.36s)]
*  We probably need some clarification on what exactly that means. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=192.12s)]
*  He's a developer of results. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=197.0s)]
*  I think he sees a good opportunity. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  But we need to obviously Gaza is not ours. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=200.84s)]
*  So, Caitlin, what's your assessment as a reporter about what the Republican reaction really is? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, you heard the senator in that last bite say they need more clarification. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=212.44s)]
*  And today they sought it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  Steve Wittkopf, the president's envoy to the Middle East, was actually here on Capitol Hill [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  meeting with Republican senators, talking to them about the plan. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  And coming out of that meeting, Senator Josh Hawley told us that they were assured by Wittkopf [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=226.68s)]
*  that the president's plan is no U.S. troops in Gaza and no American money being spent in Gaza. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=232.32s)]
*  Of course, that is not what the president said yesterday. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  I've been talking to lawmakers about this all day. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=243.56s)]
*  You heard from the speaker there calling it a bold move, which is an understatement. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=246.32s)]
*  But by and large, they are essentially not taking it literally, at least at this point. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=250.2s)]
*  But I will say that what we heard over and over from Republican senators up here on Capitol Hill, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=257.6s)]
*  that there is absolutely no appetite among senators, at least, for any U.S. troops on the ground in the Middle East. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=263.12s)]
*  And remember, as we all know, this is a president who campaigned on a non-interventionist foreign policy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  A lot of his foreign policy and a lot of what has revved up his base of support is a reaction [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=278.52000000000004s)]
*  to traditional Republican policy, especially during the Bush years and foreign intervention. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  And so this seemingly, on its face, obviously runs counter to that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=290.24s)]
*  But it does set up an interesting dynamic that we've seen on a variety of issues here [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=295.12s)]
*  where lawmakers are, you know, forced to respond to the president. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=299.68s)]
*  But this time around, they are seeming to give him more deference, more latitude, more leeway [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  and broader interpretation of what he means. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  But it was telling that Witkoff was up here talking to lawmakers. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  And Elon Musk covers over so much of these discussions, whether it's about foreign policy [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=318.72s)]
*  or especially now with domestic policy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  Let's listen to what Caitlin's exchanged with Senator Tom Tillis, a Republican of North Carolina. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=326.44s)]
*  Are you concerned about Elon Musk's role in all of this? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=336.35999999999996s)]
*  And that's because everybody needs to understand, and maybe somebody will report this honestly, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  is that Elon Musk is a, he reminds me of a strategist that I used to engage in big transformation [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=342.96s)]
*  projects back when I was in the private sector. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=350.32s)]
*  He's throwing out big ideas. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=354.08s)]
*  And if anybody thinks that all of these big ideas are going to be implemented to conclusion, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=355.72s)]
*  they don't understand the process of disruption. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  So Ed, you heard Caitlin Huey Burns and her exchange there with Senator Tillis. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=364.44000000000005s)]
*  What's the mood up at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue about Elon Musk and whether what he's doing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=368.36s)]
*  is really what President Trump wants him to be doing? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=374.12s)]
*  The attitude is keep going and keep finding examples of what could be done to save money [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  and to slash the size and scope of the federal government. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=383.92s)]
*  And based on what the president has said this week, based on what his aides say, he has [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  permission, not necessarily carte blanche, but the ability and the expectation to go [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=391.24s)]
*  into these places, try to see what's going on, determine if there are ways to perhaps [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=396.72s)]
*  streamline operations, and find ways to shave, shave, shave money off of the federal coffers. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=401.04s)]
*  And so whether it's going into various agencies and telling the probationary employees, as [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=407.68s)]
*  we expect in the coming days, that your days here are over, whether it's merging USAID [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=413.08s)]
*  into the State Department, but maintaining some level of foreign assistance, whether [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  it's going over to the Treasury Department behind us and getting a sense of how those [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=423.0s)]
*  computer systems work to make the payments of the federal treasury, and then seeing where [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=426.97999999999996s)]
*  potentially money could be saved or at least could be diverted, as Senator Tillis said, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=431.84s)]
*  that's the goal. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=436.52s)]
*  Now, a lot of this is going to require congressional involvement. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=437.52s)]
*  If it is ever implemented, it's going to be challenged in court, and we're seeing that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=442.04s)]
*  already this week when it comes to some of the personnel moves that they're trying to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=445.12s)]
*  make. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=448.64s)]
*  But all of it fulfills the campaign pledge of the president to disrupt the way Washington [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=449.64s)]
*  operates, to slash the size and scope of the federal government, and to, in essence, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=453.36s)]
*  you know, upend how things have been done and the people who do it here in Washington [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=458.96s)]
*  and across the country. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=465.0s)]
*  COSTA Thanks, Ed. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=466.0s)]
*  And Caitlin, you spoke with Democratic Congressman Sean Caston about Elon Musk and his influence. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=468.84s)]
*  Let's listen to that exchange. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=473.44s)]
*  CASTON It is totally illegal. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=474.44s)]
*  There are massive national security risks with giving classified information to people [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=478.8s)]
*  who have not been vetted, who could be compromised by foreign governments. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=484.91999999999996s)]
*  I cannot stress what a big deal this is. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=488.96s)]
*  Trillions of dollars in the hands of people who are not legally allowed to access that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=490.84s)]
*  and have the potential to be using it for illegal purposes. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=495.35999999999996s)]
*  COSTA So, Caitlin, just to wrap us up here, what can the Democrats do about Elon Musk, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=498.35999999999996s)]
*  if anything? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  And are any Republicans you're talking to frustrated about Congress being, in the view [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=505.47999999999996s)]
*  of some, sidelined in a lot of these discussions as Elon Musk moves into power? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=510.52s)]
*  CASTON Yeah, and you heard Representative Caston there specifically referring to Musk [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=515.16s)]
*  being able now to have access to the Treasury Department's payment system. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  But Democrats really don't have a lot of leverage here. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=525.6s)]
*  They are in the minority. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=529.24s)]
*  And what they're trying to do now is message to constituents. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=530.24s)]
*  We have seen lots of tele-town halls. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=534.4s)]
*  Actually, Congressman Caston told me that he is holding one soon and he has had a lot [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=538.08s)]
*  of calls, more calls than he ever has had to his office this week just in light of every [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=544.84s)]
*  thing the Trump administration is doing. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=551.4000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, they're also filing legal challenges and the like. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=552.4000000000001s)]
*  But really this is about messaging and trying to get that message out there, but they're [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  really kind of hamstrung here. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=560.32s)]
*  What's notable, though, is, Bob, what you point out, which is what is the role of Congress [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  and how do Republicans here in the majority see their role in the Trump administration? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  I've been asking lawmakers about that all week, and the overall reaction here is that [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=573.1600000000001s)]
*  they like what Musk is doing and they see that they see it as a directive of the president. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=578.92s)]
*  So they're OK with that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=585.5999999999999s)]
*  And because of what he is tasked with addressing, it is designed in their view to shrink the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=586.5999999999999s)]
*  size of government. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=593.24s)]
*  So they are welcoming this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  And it's significant because Republicans, conservatives are traditionally averse to [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=595.68s)]
*  consolidated power in the executive branch. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=600.4799999999999s)]
*  And we saw during Biden, during Trump, you know, a big negative reaction to that among [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=604.32s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  That's not the case now because they believe, at least that they're telling, that they are [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=609.5600000000001s)]
*  seeing their goals achieved here. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=614.6s)]
*  But this does raise a question of, you know, how they are going to exert their influence. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=616.64s)]
*  The big test of all of this is coming soon, actually, on the budget fights. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=623.12s)]
*  And O'Keefe and Caitlin Huey-Burns, thank you very much. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryLwBxOq7Ow&t=627.64s)]
