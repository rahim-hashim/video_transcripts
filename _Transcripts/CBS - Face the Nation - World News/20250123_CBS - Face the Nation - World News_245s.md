# Trump shifts American foreign policy
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc)
*  From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=0.0s)]
*  We will be the envy of every nation and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=7.0s)]
*  of any longer. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  From the moment President Trump took office, he signaled a major shift in American foreign [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=14.84s)]
*  policy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=18.6s)]
*  The president says he wants to acquire Greenland for national security reasons. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=19.6s)]
*  He signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, which [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=23.92s)]
*  other nations have no obligation to follow. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=28.36s)]
*  He wants to retake operational control of the Panama Canal and is sending Secretary [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=30.48s)]
*  of State Marco Rubio there likely next month, which is expected to be his first overseas [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=34.68s)]
*  trip as top U.S. envoy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=38.88s)]
*  And leading up to the inauguration, he suggested annexing Canada using quote, economic force. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=41.28s)]
*  Clayton Allen joins us now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=46.08s)]
*  He's the U.S. director for the Eurasia Group. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=47.08s)]
*  Clayton, thanks for being here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=49.2s)]
*  What do you make of President Trump's expansionist agenda and how does this play with American [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=50.2s)]
*  allies? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=54.24s)]
*  Well, first, thank you for having me. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=55.24s)]
*  Second, this is an interesting move from Trump. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  It's putting us back into the sort of great power model of U.S. influence in foreign policy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  And I think U.S. allies are responding to that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=66.04s)]
*  They're trying to figure out exactly where they're solid ground. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=67.84s)]
*  How far does Trump's preference for this manifest destiny 2.0 approach to the U.S. interaction [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  with the rest of the world actually go? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  Some of these on their face are kind of unbelievable. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=80.84s)]
*  Annexing Canada doesn't seem like a realistic option. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  But here in Greenland, maybe there's a pathway to that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=87.2s)]
*  It's hard to differentiate between these things. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=91.08s)]
*  I think that's leading to a lot of confusion and apprehension among U.S. allies. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  Manifest Destiny 2.0, interesting you put it that way. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  Could we see countries begin to rethink their relationship with the U.S.? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=99.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=103.2s)]
*  I think that this is very much, you know, the U.S. focusing on exerting its power rather [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=104.2s)]
*  than finding friends. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=110.4s)]
*  And that's going to lead to a change in the way that other countries react to the U.S. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=112.68s)]
*  So for Trump, that may be partially by design. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=116.2s)]
*  Trump certainly wants to approach interactions, whether diplomatic, economic or military, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=119.92s)]
*  from a more bilateral position where the U.S. is trying to leverage its strength. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=125.08s)]
*  Other countries, I think, now begin to see that as the dominant way to interact with [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=129.16s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=133.36s)]
*  It's less about part of becoming the same club. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=134.36s)]
*  And maybe it's more about what you can specifically offer Trump to give him what he wants. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=136.52s)]
*  Earlier this month, we covered the Eurasia Group's list of global risks for 2025. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=142.52s)]
*  The number one concern was a global leadership vacuum. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=145.92s)]
*  Does President Trump's foreign policy stances make it difficult for the U.S. to assume that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=148.55999999999997s)]
*  role as global leader? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=152.76s)]
*  Does he want to assume that role if he's withdrawing the U.S. from the WHO and the Paris Climate [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=154.04s)]
*  Agreement says things like it's their war when it comes to the ceasefire between Israel [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  and Hamas? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=163.56s)]
*  I think it's less a case of the U.S. not wanting to assume that role and more a case of the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=165.6s)]
*  U.S. being willing to in some ways exit the role. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=169.56s)]
*  The U.S. is effectively the global hegemon in many different aspects in regards. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  And Trump taking a less interactive role, whether it's in diplomacy, climate change, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=177.16s)]
*  economic management, that all kind of pulls the U.S. back. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=183.27999999999997s)]
*  It creates that vacuum. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=186.72s)]
*  It creates the space that we were really highlighting in our top risk for this year. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=187.92s)]
*  Again, can you just highlight a lot of people have been saying when there's a vacuum, that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=192.11999999999998s)]
*  means that other actors who we don't want calling the shots could call the shots. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  Am I correctly summarizing that concern? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=200.56s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=204.04s)]
*  A vacuum, nature abhors a vacuum. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=205.4s)]
*  And there's a lot of other countries that would love to fill it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=208.2s)]
*  China, Russia, though Russia is significantly constrained in its ability to do that through [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=211.24s)]
*  the impact of sanctions and other things. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=216.24s)]
*  There's also the question of countries that we don't necessarily not want to play a larger [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=218.04s)]
*  role, but that we maybe don't know that we're fully in alignment with playing a larger role [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=222.56s)]
*  simply by default. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  Again, nature abhors a vacuum. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=227.96s)]
*  The countries that fill it might be a coalition of countries from the unallied nations in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=229.92s)]
*  the BRICS or others. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=234.55999999999997s)]
*  And we're not sure what that looks like and what that means for U.S. influence and position [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=235.72s)]
*  over the longer term. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=239.76s)]
*  Clayton Allen, thank you for joining us. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=240.76s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4kugxuFUc&t=242.64s)]
