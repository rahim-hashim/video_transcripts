# Israel intercepts 300 Iranian drones and missiles amid fears of escalating regional conflict
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM)
*  We are learning that the damage from those strikes overnight has been extremely limited, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=0.0s)]
*  and we are now waiting word or actions from the Israelis about their response. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=4.96s)]
*  President Biden spoke last night to Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=10.4s)]
*  and we'll hear more about that in a moment. Here in the U.S., there is increasing political pressure [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=13.68s)]
*  on President Biden on a number of fronts when it comes to doing something to end Israel's six-month [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=19.04s)]
*  long war on Hamas in Gaza. Our new CBS News poll, taken before the Iran strikes, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=25.04s)]
*  show that only a third of Americans approve of President Biden's handling of the conflict. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  That's down five points since February. In fact, within his own party, more Democrats now sympathize, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=36.48s)]
*  quote, a lot with the Palestinian people. That's a larger number than sympathize a lot with the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=43.76s)]
*  Israelis. Our Deborah Pata reports from Tel Aviv on the attack and the aftermath. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=50.08s)]
*  From the north to the south, Israel's powerful air defense systems intercepted more than 300 [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=57.76s)]
*  Iranian drones and missiles with the help of the United States, Jordan, and the UK. It is the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=64.72s)]
*  scenario everyone has feared since the October 7 Hamas attack, a state-to-state confrontation [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=72.08s)]
*  that could spiral into a regional war. Hardline Iranian supporters celebrated the strikes as the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=79.44s)]
*  regime boasted that their Operation True Promise had exceeded their expectations, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=87.28s)]
*  despite Israel saying it intercepted 99 percent of the incoming projectiles. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  A number of Iranian missiles fell inside Israeli territory, causing minor damage to a military base [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=99.84s)]
*  with no casualties. Israel is still weighing up its response, but a former senior Israeli diplomat [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=108.72s)]
*  to the U.S., Alon Pinkes, told us President Biden warned Prime Minister Netanyahu last night [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=115.36s)]
*  not to retaliate. My understanding was that Biden told Mr. Netanyahu, if you act against Iran based [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=122.24s)]
*  on this, we will not stand by you. Pinkes said Netanyahu benefits from a war with Iran, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=130.32s)]
*  given growing anger here over his government's failure to protect Israelis from the October 7 [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=138.24s)]
*  attack. Mr. Netanyahu wanted an escalation with Iran as early as November. For him, it was a way [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=144.56s)]
*  to change the narrative, to distance himself from October 7 by wrapping it in a bigger story, in a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  bigger narrative. Just hours before the attack, tens of thousands of Israeli demonstrators took [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=158.88s)]
*  to the streets of Tel Aviv protesting against Netanyahu's mishandling of the war in Gaza [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=166.4s)]
*  and rising tensions with Iran. Pinkes also told us Iran had deliberately telegraphed details of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  the strike and knew most of the missiles and drones could be shot down, allowing Iran a shock and or [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  spectacle with minimal damage that Israel can choose to walk away from. That's our Deborah Pada in Israel. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=187.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgGLQYyYPM&t=196.32s)]
