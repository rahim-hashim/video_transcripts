# Lagarde says inflation in Europe "a different beast" than in U.S.
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E)
*  We are joined now by Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=0.0s)]
*  which sets monetary policy, including interest rates, for the 19 countries that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=4.64s)]
*  use the euro as a currency. Madame Lagarde, welcome to the program. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=8.28s)]
*  Thank you so much and good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=11.56s)]
*  Good morning. Good to have you back here in Washington. We talk often about inflation in this country, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=12.88s)]
*  but inflation is also at a record high in Europe. The Federal Reserve Chair has talked about [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=18.76s)]
*  raising interest rates in this country next month by as much as half a percent to try to get control here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=24.28s)]
*  Why do you think you can wait until the summer? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  I believe that we share the same resolve, which is to tame inflation, which is to use all the tools [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=34.2s)]
*  that we have to do so. But we're facing a different beast. When I look at my core inflation, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=42.8s)]
*  which is inflation taking out the most volatile elements such as energy and food, my core inflation is at 2.9 percent. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Inflation in Europe is very high at the moment. 50 percent of that is related to energy prices. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=56.28s)]
*  Pre-Ukraine war, it was already climbing, but the Ukraine war has dramatically increased those prices. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=64.72s)]
*  So we have to use the tools and the sequence, which is appropriate depending on the sources of inflation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=73.44s)]
*  If I raise interest rates today, it is not going to bring the price of energy down. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=83.08000000000001s)]
*  So we have embarked on that journey of gradually removing our Commodative Monetary Policy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=88.68s)]
*  So we will be interrupting the purchases of assets in the course of the third quarter, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=96.92s)]
*  high probability that we do so early in the third quarter. And then we will look at interest rates [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  and how and by how much we hike them. But we have to be data dependent because of the sources of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=110.76s)]
*  inflation that we have at the moment. You have said energy, high energy and lack of confidence [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=117.72s)]
*  could be persistent here. Does that indicate a high degree of concern that we could be tipping [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=123.64s)]
*  into a recession? And can you raise rates without that risk? It's the trade-off that central [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=129.56s)]
*  bank governors face at the moment. We have to be guided by our mandate, by our objective, which is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=137.56s)]
*  to restore price stability, which we have all defined as roughly 2%. So that's the mandate. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  But at the same time, we have to do so in a sufficiently well sequenced, well calibrated, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=152.28s)]
*  for us in Europe, gradual way so that we don't induce recession. We currently are facing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=159.96s)]
*  winds that reduce growth and increase inflation. So we have to navigate between the two, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=167.8s)]
*  guided by the mandate of price stability and bringing inflation down. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=174.36s)]
*  You've referenced the war with Russia a few times here, and we've all been learning just how dependent [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=180.52s)]
*  Europe is on Russia for its supply of fossil fuels. Germany warned an embargo of Russian gas [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  could cause economic output to drop 5%. And yet there are calls for total embargoes on Russian [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=193.64s)]
*  gasoline. I mean, is this practical? And how much is the politics impacting us? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=199.88s)]
*  I think we have to be guided by the purpose that we have. And the purpose we have is to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=207.72s)]
*  reduce and possibly cancel the financing that is provided to Russia to finance the war, the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=213.16s)]
*  unjustifiable illegitimate war of Russia against Ukraine. So we have to adjust the policies, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=222.44s)]
*  whether it is sanctions, whether it is de-swifting the banks, whether it is cutting out the oligarchs [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=231.24s)]
*  from their assets and their sources of financing, whether it is reducing and eventually cutting out [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=239.0s)]
*  supplies from Russia in such a way that we actually reach the goal we have, which is to reduce [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=246.2s)]
*  financing. If we were to take abrupt measures that would induce an increase of the price of oil or [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=251.4s)]
*  gas around the world, from which the Russians would eventually benefit, then that would not be the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=260.76s)]
*  right policy move. So we have to do it in sufficiently smart and subtle a way so that we actually [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=266.76s)]
*  achieve the goal that we have, which is to reduce the financing. And I think that's what the Europeans [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=273.56s)]
*  together are looking at. The plan to completely boycott coal has been adopted. There's a lot of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=278.12s)]
*  work going on concerning oil, concerning gas, and there will be more stories to tell a bit later on. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=285.24s)]
*  In this country, there's a lot of debate around how much the government is to blame versus [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=294.12s)]
*  the central bankers for the inflation that we're experiencing. The US spent $6 trillion on COVID [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=299.48s)]
*  relief, $2 trillion of it, on President Biden's watch last spring when the economy was already [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=305.4s)]
*  recovering. Do you think some of this spending in the US exacerbated inflation because Europe [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=311.4s)]
*  didn't spend like this? We in Europe spent less in stimulus, and I think we spent differently. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=317.23999999999995s)]
*  We spent pretty much half as much as what the US government spent on stimulus and heating up the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=326.2s)]
*  economy. But we also spent it differently because I think the focus was predominantly on keeping the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=334.76s)]
*  jobs, not necessarily sending the checks. And as a result of that, people who managed to keep their [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  jobs alive while not necessarily going to work because COVID stopped everybody from going to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  work at some point in time, they had their job. So when COVID was over, they went back to their job. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=355.56s)]
*  So I think that the labor market that you have currently in this country, in the US, which is [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=362.12s)]
*  incredibly tense, where you have a lot of jobs that are not filled, where you have plenty of vacancies, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=367.96s)]
*  we don't have that in Europe at the moment. And the current situation you have on the labor market [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=378.6s)]
*  here in the US is clearly contributing to possible strong inflation and second round effect where [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=384.59999999999997s)]
*  prices go up, wages go up, short supply of labor, wages continue to go up, and that feeds back into [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=392.91999999999996s)]
*  prices. That's one of the differences between our two economies. You've been in key positions [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=399.56s)]
*  throughout a number of economic crises. How dangerous is this moment that we are in right now? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=404.91999999999996s)]
*  It is a difficult moment, but it's one where very interesting phenomenon developed. If I look from [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=411.32s)]
*  my vantage point at Europe, the Russian aggression against Ukraine has produced three key results. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=419.24s)]
*  It has resurrected NATO. This is Easter Day, so I'm not, I'm not, you know, fantasizing here, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=427.16s)]
*  but it has resurrected NATO. It has united the Europeans more than ever, and it has strengthened [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=434.44s)]
*  a nation, Ukraine. The price of that is terrible, the debt, the destruction, the devastation, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=442.36s)]
*  and we are all concerned and all want to help. But this is quite an interesting development, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=449.56s)]
*  and we have to be united and resolved to actually address the situation together because there has [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=456.04s)]
*  to be solidarity. I have to end it there because we're out of time. We'll be back. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCriIqui1E&t=461.4s)]
