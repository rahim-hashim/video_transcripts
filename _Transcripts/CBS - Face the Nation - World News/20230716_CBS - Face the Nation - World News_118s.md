*  Chris Livsay, who filed this report from Rome. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=4.72s)]
*  Well, the heat wave is named after the three-headed dog that guards the underworld in Greek mythology. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  And with temperatures set to rise even further, it has its jaws firmly locked on Southern [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=14.88s)]
*  Europe. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=20.48s)]

*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=26.12s)]
*  For two days, Greek officials were forced to close the ancient Acropolis during the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=27.74s)]
*  most scorching hours to prevent further injuries. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=32.54s)]
*  We put on 60 SPF, so we're good. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=36.9s)]
*  We have our water, no complaints. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=39.9s)]
*  It's really hard. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  I've got asthma, so this heat is terrible for it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=44.019999999999996s)]
*  In Italy, 16 cities have been placed under a red alert for the extreme heat. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=48.34s)]
*  Some regions in the South may even exceed 120 degrees. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=54.3s)]
*  Surface temperatures are sizzling even hotter. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=60.14s)]
*  In Spain, thermal imaging resembles the sun as ground temperatures reach a blistering [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=62.9s)]
*  140 degrees. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=68.9s)]
*  Forest fires ripped through the Spanish island of La Palma, destroying homes and displacing [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=71.86s)]
*  hundreds. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=77.25999999999999s)]
*  All this while East Asia is being inundated. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=79.14s)]

*  In one incident, a freeway tunnel was flooded, leaving many drivers trapped. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=89.42s)]
*  Indeed, temperatures have been rising steadily for years. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=94.58s)]
*  The highest temperature ever recorded in Europe was right here in Italy, just a hair under [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=99.02s)]
*  120 degrees only two years ago. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=105.06s)]
*  The fear is that this year and years to come could be even worse. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWknXydJPs&t=109.18s)]
