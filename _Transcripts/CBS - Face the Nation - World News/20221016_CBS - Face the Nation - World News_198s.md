# Ukrainian civilians battered in heaviest bombardment since invasion began
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw)
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=0.0s)]
*  Hundreds of Russian missiles have rained down on Ukrainian territory over the past week, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=2.0s)]
*  most of them aimed at civilian targets. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=7.0s)]
*  CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie Dagata is in Dnipro, Ukraine with more. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=10.0s)]
*  Days after unleashing the heaviest bombardment that Ukraine has seen since the invasion began, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=17.0s)]
*  striking a dozen cities across the country [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=23.0s)]
*  and a coordinated series of rocket and long-range missile attacks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=26.0s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin said there is no need for more massive strikes for now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=31.0s)]
*  At a news conference in Kazakhstan, he said he had no regrets and that Russia is doing everything right. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=38.0s)]
*  The merciless battering of civilians in frontline cities like Zaporizhzhia tell a different story. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=45.0s)]
*  Residents told us a missile slammed into this neighborhood at around two in the morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=53.0s)]
*  The missile punched a hole right through this apartment block, causing it to collapse on those inside, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=58.0s)]
*  tearing apart not just homes but lives. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=65.0s)]
*  The blast scattered children's clothes among the trees. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=69.0s)]
*  At one point, the heavy machinery clearing the rubble stopped. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=73.0s)]
*  A drone hovered overhead as rescuers worked by hand. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=78.0s)]
*  And another body was lifted from beneath the debris. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=82.0s)]
*  Investigators worked to put a name to another victim of Putin's war. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=86.0s)]
*  Serhii Nikonorov lives in the adjacent apartment and escaped serious injury, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=91.0s)]
*  but he's so shell-shocked he can hardly speak. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=95.0s)]
*  My very close friends lived there on the first floor, he said. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=99.0s)]
*  I lost friends on the second floor too. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=103.0s)]
*  And yet, despite Russia's onslaught, troops have lost ground to Ukrainian forces on the battlefield, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=108.0s)]
*  where the counteroffensive has advanced south. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=115.0s)]
*  At such a rate, the Kremlin-installed authorities in the city of Khursan [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=118.0s)]
*  urged residents to evacuate to parts of Russia. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=121.0s)]
*  In his address last night, President Zelenskyi switched from Ukrainian to Russian, saying, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=125.0s)]
*  As for the citizens of Russia who do not want to participate in this criminal war, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=130.0s)]
*  who surrender to Ukrainian captivity will save their lives. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=136.0s)]
*  We visited some of the dozens of those recently liberated villages. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=140.0s)]
*  The high school that served as a Russian military HQ bears the scars of the battle to wrestle it back. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=144.0s)]
*  Down the road, we found Oksana still reeling. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=151.0s)]
*  What did you think when you first saw Ukrainian soldiers here? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=155.0s)]
*  Happiness. She said, I was just very happy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=158.0s)]
*  In tears, she described the terror under Russian occupation, saying, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=162.0s)]
*  We were all suffering. It was so hard and so scary. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=167.0s)]
*  Now, free from Russian military rule for the first time in months. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=172.0s)]
*  The next day, following that huge barrage, President Zelenskyi pleaded with leaders of the G7, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=178.0s)]
*  specifically the United States, for more air defense systems. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=184.0s)]
*  And while there has been a pledge by the White House for more advanced weapons, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=188.0s)]
*  they can't get here quickly enough. Margaret? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=192.0s)]
*  Charlie Daggett, thank you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axpQFPAcWaw&t=196.0s)]
