# Netanyahu testifies at his corruption trial, denies any wrongdoing
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk)
*  All right, turning to Israel now, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has taken to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=0.0s)]
*  witness stand this morning in his long-running trial for alleged corruption. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=3.72s)]
*  It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has been seated on the stand as a [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=7.28s)]
*  criminal defendant. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=11.52s)]
*  Joining us now for more on this is CBS News foreign correspondent Debra Pada. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=12.84s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us, Debra. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=16.8s)]
*  So describe what happened in court today. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=18.64s)]
*  Well, as you mentioned, it is indeed a very pivotal moment. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=21.52s)]
*  Finally, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, has taken the stand. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=27.24s)]
*  In a nutshell, Netanyahu is accused of corruption and bribery, but he denied any wrongdoing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Although it's definitely a low point in his decades-long political career, his critics [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=37.16s)]
*  say he's obsessed with his image, and this will stand in stark contrast to his desperation, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=41.76s)]
*  really, to be seen as a respected international statesman. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=47.44s)]
*  In fact, much of the case actually revolves around the media and allegations of offering [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=50.8s)]
*  political favors in exchange for positive coverage. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=56.08s)]
*  So Netanyahu spent much of the day delivering a lecture on the relationship between the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=59.6s)]
*  media and politicians and how he believes it should play out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=64.48s)]
*  He even went so far as to cite naming examples of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=69.28s)]
*  saying that they had an entire history of starting their own media outlets and that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=77.2s)]
*  this is very common in the U.S. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=82.88s)]
*  That was pretty much most of what he said on the stand today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=86.04s)]
*  Vlad? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=89.92s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=90.92s)]
*  This all comes, obviously, Deborah, as you know, you've been covering this since the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=91.92s)]
*  beginning, this turbulent time in the Middle East. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=95.64s)]
*  Are there any concerns that this trial will be a distraction for the prime minister because [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=98.72s)]
*  there are some very serious threats in the region? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=103.84s)]
*  There are indeed. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=107.0s)]
*  I mean, he's battling with a war in Gaza. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  There's this fragile ceasefire in Lebanon and now this dramatic change for the entire [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=113.48s)]
*  region with the collapse of the Assad regime. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=119.44s)]
*  So yes, he certainly has a lot on his plate. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=122.76s)]
*  But remember, he has delayed testifying for years on end. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=125.76s)]
*  The trial started in 2020 and he kept on coming up with reasons why he could not appear. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=129.88s)]
*  The judge was fed up and said today is the day. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=136.2s)]
*  And certainly that is what Netanyahu wanted the judge to believe, that this would be too [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=139.0s)]
*  much of a distraction given his repeated attempts to delay this trial. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=144.0s)]
*  His critics really have sought to link his corruption trial, in fact, to the war in Gaza, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=150.28s)]
*  Vlad, saying the allegations led the prime minister to attempt a contentious judicial [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=154.36s)]
*  overhaul last year. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=159.72s)]
*  That was before the law. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=160.8s)]
*  You'll remember that massive protest in Israel. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=161.88s)]
*  And that really divided this country and created an image of weakness, his critics say, which [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=165.84s)]
*  encouraged the October 7 Hamas attack. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=170.36s)]
*  And he's also been accused by protesters now of dragging out that war in a bid to stay [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=172.84s)]
*  in power and avoid his corruption case. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=178.52s)]
*  Remember, it's not only his only legal challenge. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=181.28s)]
*  He also faces a warrant of arrest for war crimes issued by the International Criminal [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=184.4s)]
*  Court. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=189.12s)]
*  And obviously he wants to try and stay out of jail. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=190.56s)]
*  Fraud and breach of trust are punishable by up to three years in jail and other charges [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=193.4s)]
*  up to 10 years. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=199.32s)]
*  Vlad. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Deborah Padditt for us reporting live from Israel this evening. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Deborah. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=206.08s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBwUd7Oq1Hk&t=207.08s)]
