# Finnish president urges NATO allies to remove Ukraine missile restrictions
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. Ukrainian President Zelensky will be in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=0.0s)]
*  Washington tomorrow with meetings with President Biden and Vice President Harris on his schedule. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=3.92s)]
*  Also meeting probably with some lawmakers. All this after he addressed the General Assembly. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=8.52s)]
*  Today here's a bit of what President Zelensky said. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=12.92s)]
*  It not only ignores reality but also gives Putin the political space to continue the war [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=15.92s)]
*  and pressure the world to bring more nations under control. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=24.12s)]
*  Any parallel or alternative attempts to seek peace are in fact efforts to achieve a law instead of an end to the war. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=29.04s)]
*  Arwita Jang is covering the General Assembly. Earlier today she spoke to the leader of one of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  NATO's newest member countries, Finland, and President Alexander Stubbe. Let's listen. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  First I want to ask you, since Finland joined NATO, do your people feel safer? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=53.56s)]
*  How has the level of reassurance changed? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=61.56s)]
*  Well, we do feel safer. But the truth is that we also have a very strong defense ourselves. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=64.56s)]
*  And that's why we became NATO members extremely fast. We have one of the largest militaries in Europe. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=69.56s)]
*  And I think NATO wanted us because if you double your border with Russia, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=75.56s)]
*  it's better to have a country that is quite serious about its defense. We feel very secure and safe, no problem. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=80.48s)]
*  What can you tell us about the two NATO bases that are reportedly in Finland? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=85.48s)]
*  Well, what we're trying to do right now is to integrate ourselves into NATO. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=91.48s)]
*  And that means that first of all we are under Norfolk together with the other Nordic countries. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=95.48s)]
*  And then we have two components. One is a land component and the other one are these FLFs, Forward Land Forces. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=100.48s)]
*  And we haven't decided yet where they're going to go, but we're talking more on a rotational basis. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=107.4s)]
*  So we're not talking about a base with 5,000 soldiers. We are talking of tens of officers. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=111.4s)]
*  And then we look at how it is structured within the next year or two. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=118.4s)]
*  Obviously, we heard from President Zelensky today. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=122.4s)]
*  He continues to call for NATO allies to support his request to use long-range missiles deeper into Russia. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=125.4s)]
*  You agree with him that that is the right approach. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=134.32s)]
*  What is your message to President Biden, who has so far been resistant? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=136.32s)]
*  My message to all of our allies is to allow Ukraine to fight this war against Russia with both hands. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=140.32s)]
*  Now it has one hand behind its back. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=148.32s)]
*  Finland has absolutely no restrictions on what kind of weapons and which range Ukraine can use in Russia, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=151.32s)]
*  as long as two things are met. It's for defense purposes and it is within the framework of international law. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  So I am actually quite hopeful that when Zelensky presents his victory plan to President Joe Biden tomorrow, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  there should be hopefully some news that gives a little bit of alleviation to the way in which Ukraine is fighting the war. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  Have you personally had a conversation with President Biden about that? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=179.24s)]
*  I haven't about this, no. I've talked with him about many other things, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=185.16s)]
*  but I did speak about this particular issue with both Zelensky and in passing with Foreign Secretary, Secretary of State Blinken. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=188.16s)]
*  And then finally, just today, President Biden during an interview warned that if the former president, Donald Trump, were to win in November, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=199.16s)]
*  that would be the end of NATO. Do you agree with that? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, I don't take issue in the American elections. I am in no position to do that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  And I, as president of Finland, will get along with whichever president is elected for the United States. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  I do believe that the United States will stay committed to NATO and to Europe, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  because if it wants to retain its position, maintain its position as a superpower, it needs allies. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  And 32 of those allies are in NATO. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  You have heard what the former president has said before about NATO. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  Do you take any of it seriously? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=243.0s)]
*  Well, I take at least one thing very seriously, and that is defense expenditure. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=247.0s)]
*  And I think he's been right on that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=252.0s)]
*  So he has in many ways, with his language, which is quite rough at times, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=253.0s)]
*  forced a lot of the allies to increase their defense spending up to 2%. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=257.0s)]
*  Remember that in 2014, there were only three allies that reached that goal. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=263.0s)]
*  Now we're 23. So on that particular issue, I think he's right. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=266.0s)]
*  And I hope that where he should be elected again, he would see the benefit of the alliance, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=270.92s)]
*  not least in keeping Europe secure and also with his ambitions that he might have in the Pacific. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=277.92s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. Appreciate your time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG19Kn1wsA&t=284.92s)]
