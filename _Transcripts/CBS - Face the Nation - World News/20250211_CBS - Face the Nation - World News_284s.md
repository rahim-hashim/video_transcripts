# Trump has “isolated himself in the Middle East,” foreign policy expert says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0)
*  President Trump's meeting with the King of Jordan comes at a fragile moment for the Middle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=0.0s)]
*  East. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=4.64s)]
*  King Abdullah told the president he believes there is a real opportunity to achieve peace [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=5.64s)]
*  in the region. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=9.48s)]
*  At the same time, President Trump is threatening that, quote, all hell will break loose if [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=10.72s)]
*  Hamas does not release all the hostages in Gaza by Saturday. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=15.08s)]
*  Like Egypt, Jordan shares a border with Israel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=19.3s)]
*  Both countries have flatly rejected President Trump's proposal to resettle Palestinians [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=22.2s)]
*  from Gaza. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=26.86s)]
*  Brian Ketulis joins us now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  He's a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Middle East Institute. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=29.52s)]
*  Brian Ketulis joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=33.96s)]
*  He's a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Middle East Institute. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=35.4s)]
*  Thank you for being here, Brian. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=39.8s)]
*  Let's take a step back. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=41.92s)]
*  Can you give us some background on the strategic relationship between the U.S. and Jordan and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=43.6s)]
*  the role Jordan plays in pursuing long lasting peace in the region? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=48.08s)]
*  Well, Jordan's been a crucial partner for decades with the United States, working on [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  counterterrorism efforts against Al Qaeda and then more recently with ISIS. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=58.0s)]
*  Last year, if you remember when Iran attacked Israel, Jordan was key part of our alliance [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  that actually helped thwart that attack. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=68.24s)]
*  So they're a longstanding partner and they have called for a two-state solution, which [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=71.06s)]
*  would include the creation of a Palestinian state for years. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=75.12s)]
*  That's not what President Trump is proposing in some of his most recent statements. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=79.66s)]
*  He's proposing something different. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  But King Abdullah today doubled down on that and he did that with the backing of all of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=85.72s)]
*  the Arab countries, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and others. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=91.12s)]
*  So in this sense, Trump himself has isolated himself in the Middle East. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=94.28s)]
*  Only a few people in Israel are actually putting much stock in what Trump has been trying to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=98.6s)]
*  sell here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, President Trump initially threatened to withhold aid. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  He then walked that back. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=106.52s)]
*  The King is now offering to accept 2,000 Palestinian children with health problems. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, what do you make of sort of the one day we're withholding aid, one day he says [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=111.6s)]
*  we think we can work things out and how are we supposed to frame that when things are [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  already so fragile in the area? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  We've got a leader who prides himself in his unpredictability, but increasingly in the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=125.8s)]
*  Middle East, America is not seen as a reliable partner. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=130.4s)]
*  When Trump makes statements, whether it's with partners like Jordan or with neighbors [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=134.04s)]
*  like Canada and makes sort of threats and imposes threats or then walks back from them, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=138.94s)]
*  it doesn't build trust or confidence. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  The end result will be he'll get something like this gesture from King Abdullah with [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=146.7s)]
*  the 2,000 children that they're treating. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=151.5s)]
*  It's something that I understand Jordan has been doing for a long time. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=153.9s)]
*  President Trump himself probably didn't know the details of a lot of this stuff, so he [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=157.46s)]
*  was impressed or he looked to be impressed by King Abdullah's statement there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=161.42s)]
*  But this is true to form, in my view of Trump. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=165.3s)]
*  He makes a lot of statements, gets the spotlight and attention from the media, from folks like [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=167.54s)]
*  you, but then the actual policy results don't really matter that much. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=172.54s)]
*  The world moves on and there's been a lot of like energy burns, but it didn't really [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  substantially improve the situation for Palestinians or Israelis on the ground. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=181.26s)]
*  So I want to play another sound bite and ask if you think that that's the same thing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  If all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12 o'clock, I would say cancel [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=189.86s)]
*  it and all bets are off and let hell break out. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=197.26000000000002s)]
*  All of them, not in drips and drabs, not two and one and three and four and two. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=201.18s)]
*  So is this another example, in your opinion, of the president talking tough, but do you [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=207.22s)]
*  think that there will be any policy to come or follow through? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=211.38s)]
*  It seems like, yeah, it seems like he blusters again here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=215.9s)]
*  The thing that worries me about this one is that there are hostages, including American [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=220.34s)]
*  hostages. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=225.38s)]
*  And for Trump to make a statement like that, when he says all hell will break loose, he's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=226.82s)]
*  essentially signing a death warrant, unfortunately, I think, for those hostages. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=230.66s)]
*  The real responsible thing to do would be to say, look, I've sent my team, which he [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=236.86s)]
*  has, to try to negotiate an extension of this ceasefire to get more hostages home, to get [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=241.1s)]
*  more aid to Palestinians in there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=246.9s)]
*  But instead, he does these. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=249.22s)]
*  And if you remember, in his first term, he talked about fire and fury with North Korea. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=251.06s)]
*  And then a year or two later, he's sitting down with a North Korean leader. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=255.54s)]
*  And again, he got zero results from that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=259.5s)]
*  So we often, I think, in our political culture and media culture here, pay attention to a [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=262.14s)]
*  lot of the nonsense that he says. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=267.74s)]
*  For sure, Trump is doing a lot of things, most of it bad, some of it good. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=269.70000000000005s)]
*  But he essentially is probably not going to get the results that he hopes for in making [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=275.18s)]
*  a statement like this. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=279.58000000000004s)]
*  Interesting perspective. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=280.74s)]
*  Brian Katulis, thank you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIloGOdUkk0&t=281.78000000000003s)]
