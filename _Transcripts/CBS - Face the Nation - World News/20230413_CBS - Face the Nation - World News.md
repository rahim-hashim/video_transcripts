# President Biden touts U.S.-Ireland ties in speech to Irish parliament | full video
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg)
*  echlophatic applause [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=0.0s)]
*  It's not somebody's... [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=30.0s)]
*  It wasn't duty at you, Deputy Healy Ray. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=37.0s)]
*  President Biden, Taoiseach, College of the United States, opposition party and group leaders, Senators of the State, Labour and Bid Sack, members of Congress, ambassadors, members of both houses, MEPs, MLAs, MPs, members of the Biden family and distinguished guests. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=50.0s)]
*  I think I must mention somebody else, Mr. President, because it's just come to my attention that a very young observer is in attendance here today, and that is the daughter of Senator Rebecca Moynihan, our infant daughter Margot. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=75.0s)]
*  And I do suspect that Margot's attendance here will go down in family folklore for many years to come. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=105.0s)]
*  In the Biden family, there is a great deal of work to be done, both in the Parliament and in the House. It's a very important day for the House and a very important day for us all today. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=120.0s)]
*  We have looked forward to, since your election as the 46th President of the United States, just over two years ago. Today, you do us the honour of addressing our joint sitting. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=150.0s)]
*  It's the fourth time the Houses have been addressed by a US President. Almost 60 years ago, on the 28th of June 1963, in a very different world and a very different Ireland, the late President John F. Kennedy addressed the Houses and inspired our people. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=164.0s)]
*  It is particularly fitting, therefore, that you should address us so close to that important anniversary. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=184.0s)]
*  Today, we acknowledge the presence in Ireland of his grand-nephew, Joseph Kennedy III, the new US economic envoy to Northern Ireland, and we wish him every success in the important role of supporting peace and prosperity that you have assigned to him. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=192.0s)]
*  Mr. President, while all previous presidential addresses have been of major significance, today's is like no other. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=214.0s)]
*  Because amongst an extensive list of distinguished guests, we are joined here in the Dáil today by our former illustrious President Mary McAleese, former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, a key architect of the Good Friday Agreement, former Taoiseach Enda Kenny, a fellow Mayo man and a close personal friend we know of yours. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=236.0s)]
*  Joining us also is the former President of Sinn Féin and a former member of this House, Gerry Adams, who played such a key role in the Good Friday Agreement negotiations. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=260.0s)]
*  From north of the border, we also welcome Alex Maskey, Speaker of the Northern Assembly, Michelle O'Neill, the Northern Leader of Sinn Féin, Colin Eastwood, Leader of the SDLP and a successor to the great John Hume Nobel Peace Laureate and an initiator of the Good Friday Agreement. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=272.0s)]
*  And Naomi Long, Leader of the very progressive and growing Alliance Party. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=301.0s)]
*  I extend a special welcome also to Ms Mary Heaney, whose late husband Seamus Heaney is a favourite poet of yours Mr. President and of ours also. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=308.0s)]
*  A Nobel Prize winner and one of our great literary treasures. Seamus would have been 84 today and I'm sure he is looking down on us with his glasses nestled between his fingers and a hint of a smile on his face. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=331.0s)]
*  From the Diplomatic Corps, I warmly welcome the US Ambassador Claire Cronin and her Irish counterpart in Washington, Ambassador Geraldine Byrne-Nason. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=354.0s)]
*  One of the very best of our diplomats. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=375.0s)]
*  These two outstanding women have done our two countries proud. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=384.0s)]
*  We are joined too by the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, the Moroccan Ambassador to Ireland, the representative of the European Commission and Parliament, Jonathan Claridge and Fionnuala Croker, our dear neighbour and friend, Ambassador Paul Johnson of the United Kingdom. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=389.0s)]
*  But may I extend a very special and warm welcome to the much admired Ukrainian Ambassador to Ireland. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=408.0s)]
*  Someone who has become incredibly well known to all of us, Larissa Gerasco, who above all else represents the nearly 80,000 displaced Ukrainian citizens now resident in Ireland. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=416.0s)]
*  So for you, Mr. President, quite a gathering. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=438.0s)]
*  And with the greatest of respect, Mr. President, I must say you sure can draw a crowd. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=453.0s)]
*  Perhaps afterwards you might give me some hints on how we could ensure a good attendance around here on Thursday afternoon. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=460.0s)]
*  President Biden, today you are amongst friends because you are one of us. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=470.0s)]
*  You often speak of your Irish roots with great pride and affection, especially your ancestors from Laos and Mayo. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=477.0s)]
*  And the story of Ireland is inextricably linked to emigration and in many ways you personify it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=484.0s)]
*  From the famine times through to today, so many people left these shores in search of a better life in the United States. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=491.0s)]
*  And a remarkable 33, maybe 34 million Americans now claim Irish ancestry. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=499.0s)]
*  The signatories of the 1916 proclamation said that this very republic came into being with the support, and I quote, of its exiled children in America. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=506.0s)]
*  And how true that was. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=520.0s)]
*  Down through the years our exiles supported Ireland economically and politically and never forgot the families they left behind. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=524.0s)]
*  All through your political career, sir, you too have been a faithful and supportive friend of Ireland. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=532.0s)]
*  You have been there to quote the well-known song, In sunshine or in shadow. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=539.0s)]
*  So on this historic occasion, your homecoming, we warmly welcome you back to your roots. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=544.0s)]
*  From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for all you have done and continue to do for us here in Ireland. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=550.0s)]
*  The Ireland you are visiting this week is a multicultural, progressive nation, benefiting enormously from an inflow of immigrants who have arrived on our shores from across the world. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=558.0s)]
*  They enrich our society and help us grow our economy. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=570.0s)]
*  Just like the Irish did, and many other nations in the United States in years gone by, they also challenge all of us, all of us, to be better than we are and better than we think we can be. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=588.0s)]
*  Our two countries enjoy a warm, close and mutually beneficial relationship. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=606.0s)]
*  It has been an enduring relationship, built on shared values and shared economic interests, as well as a passion for politics and a love of culture matters that you have highlighted frequently. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=612.0s)]
*  Economically, Ireland has benefited immensely from US investment, which supports over 370,000 jobs in Ireland today. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=624.0s)]
*  As a result, we now have thriving technology, healthcare and financial services sectors. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=634.0s)]
*  Less spoken about, however, are the 650 plus Irish companies that operate across all 50 states of the Union, employing over 100,000 people, and the fact that Ireland today is the ninth largest source of foreign direct investment in the United States. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=640.0s)]
*  Long may this bilateral investment continue. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=663.0s)]
*  Eir scáidh a chéile a baram na bhaíle. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=668.0s)]
*  Mr. President, two years ago, on a cold January day in Washington DC, you spoke of the importance of unity and hope. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=680.0s)]
*  As we gather in this Easter week, we recognise that the world is in need of hope. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=690.0s)]
*  Hope for those affected by war, hope for those suffering from hunger and hope for those in the face of the existential threat of climate change. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=696.0s)]
*  On this island, your visit to Northern Ireland is an important statement of hope and support for building a better and continued peaceful and prosperous future for all. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=709.0s)]
*  We thank you for your unstinting and constructive support for the Good Friday Agreement over the last 25 years and for your continued close engagement, which you demonstrated so powerfully this week. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=720.0s)]
*  Friends and colleagues, politics, despite what the Syriacs might say, is a noble profession. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=735.0s)]
*  And we are fortunate today to welcome not just a very fine politician, but an outstanding and international statesman. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=742.0s)]
*  President Biden, in life, you have demonstrated unshakable faith, deep resilience and the ability to bring people of diverse and often conflicting views together. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=752.0s)]
*  Above all, to quote the memorable words of the iconic Seamus Heaney, you challenge us to believe that the farther shore is reachable. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=767.0s)]
*  I invite you now to address the houses. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=780.0s)]
*  Well, Mom, you said it would happen. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=797.0s)]
*  And Margo, I apologize to you, little baby girl. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=802.0s)]
*  The idea you're subject to hearing a president of the United States have to deliver a policy speech is as bad as my old my children had been put through. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=805.0s)]
*  Speaking of my children, my son Hunter is with me and my best friend in the world, my sister Valerie, is with me today. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=816.0s)]
*  And I want to thank her. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=822.0s)]
*  As the proud son of Catherine Eugenia Finningham Biden, well, you knew I'd be coming. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=832.0s)]
*  Speaker, chair, Taoiseachs, all. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=843.0s)]
*  And I, Deputy Prime Minister, TD, senators, people of Ireland, it's so good to be back in Ireland. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=847.0s)]
*  If you forgive the poor, tempted Irish, Tom, I shall wallow. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=855.0s)]
*  I'm at home. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=860.0s)]
*  Only wish I could stay longer. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=870.0s)]
*  But I always have a little bit of Ireland close by, even when I'm in Washington. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=873.0s)]
*  In the Oval Office, I have the rugby ball signed by the Irish rugby team, the ball the team played when they beat the All Blacks in Dublin. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=878.0s)]
*  By the way. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=887.0s)]
*  My cousin, one of Ireland's greatest rugby stars, Rob Kearney, brought it to D.C. on St. Patrick's Day in 2022 to give me. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=900.0s)]
*  And I didn't play rugby except when I was out of school, out of law school, and I didn't play it very well. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=908.0s)]
*  We played in a rugby club, but I did play American football and a few other sports. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=914.0s)]
*  But I realized that, you know, you guys are all nuts. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=919.0s)]
*  But the interesting thing is I'd rather have my children playing rugby now for health reasons than I would have them playing football. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=924.0s)]
*  Fewer people get hurt playing rugby and you have no equipment. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=931.0s)]
*  You have 280 pound guys like we do. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=934.0s)]
*  And you just don't hit each other in the head very often. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=937.0s)]
*  And but anyway, all kidding aside, I in 2016, I came to Ireland as vice president, bringing most of my family with me, my sister Valerie, my brother Jimmy, my daughter and my five granddaughters and grandchildren. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=940.0s)]
*  My granddaughters are crazy about me, I might add, because I talk to them every single day. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=953.0s)]
*  I send them an O. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=957.0s)]
*  Together, we explored our family history visiting the Kuli Peninsula, where the Finnegans ancestors earned their living on land and sea. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=959.0s)]
*  And walking the streets of Ballina where my great, great, great grandfather blew it, lived with his family before relocated in 1851, eventually settling in my hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=966.0s)]
*  Yesterday, I returned to County Louth, where I toured the Collingford Castle, likely one of the last glimpses of Ireland my Finnegans ancestors saw as they gazed on their way out. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=977.0s)]
*  And what in those days was referred to as a coffin ship. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=988.0s)]
*  And they sailed out of Newbury in 1850. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=991.0s)]
*  I wasn't going to say this, but I'll say it anyway. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=994.0s)]
*  The idea was, I later learned from the Irish times, they did some little background check, and my good friend Barack Obama, and he is my good friend. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=996.0s)]
*  His grandfather was a shoemaker like mine, sailed five weeks earlier from the same port. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1004.0s)]
*  The idea they both sail for a new life and thought their great, great grandsons would both be president, I think, is really a little bit of Irish malarkey. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1012.0s)]
*  That's my victory, isn't it? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1024.0s)]
*  Tomorrow, I'll also revisit County Mayo and remember the history and hope and the heartbreak my Bluewood ancestors must have felt leaving their beloved homeland to begin new lives in America. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1029.0s)]
*  I sell this not to wax poetic about bygone days, but because of the story of my family's journey and those who left and those who stayed is emblematic of the stories of so many Irish and American families, not just Irish American families. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1041.0s)]
*  And these stories are the very heart of what binds Ireland and America together. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1057.0s)]
*  They speak to a history defined by our dreams. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1063.0s)]
*  They speak to a present written by our shared responsibility, and they speak to a future poised for unlimited shared possibilities. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1067.0s)]
*  So today, I'd like to reflect on the enduring strength of the connections between Ireland and the United States, a partnership for the ages. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1075.0s)]
*  It begins in our shared history, dating back to the very founding of the United States. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1083.0s)]
*  The Irish hearts that helped kindle the torch of liberty in my country and fire its revolutionary spirit. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1089.0s)]
*  The Irish blood from across this island that was willingly given for my country's independence. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1096.0s)]
*  The Irish hands that laid the foundations of a new kind of future. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1102.0s)]
*  One from the bottom up and the middle out. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1106.0s)]
*  One built on freedom. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1109.0s)]
*  You know, the great ways of immigration that brought our ancestors to the United States in succeeding decades carried millions more Irishman across the sea. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1111.0s)]
*  Most of them arrived a little more than with hope in their hearts and strength of their dreams and beautiful memories of an emerald green, green aisle, a home they would never fully leave behind. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1120.0s)]
*  I've never met an Irishman in America who doesn't think he will hope he could see Ireland someday. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1131.0s)]
*  You know, their sweet, their sweat is soaked with the foundations of communities across the nation. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1136.0s)]
*  All across America, you can't go anywhere and not find it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1143.0s)]
*  By the way, Tip O'Neill, the former Speaker of the House, used to say that he'd have a he'd have a reception for all the Irish in the Congress, the House and the Senate and all those who wish they were Irish. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1147.0s)]

*  And he kept saying, now, Joe, remember, remember, these people are not these are my people. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1211.0s)]
*  They're Spanish. They're not used to be taking. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1215.0s)]
*  You got to show respect and I said, I understand. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1217.0s)]
*  He kept kept it up. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1220.0s)]
*  I kept it up. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1221.0s)]
*  Finally, I turned to God's truth, this refurbished train station. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1222.0s)]
*  OK, it had like linen kind of wallpaper on it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1226.0s)]
*  And about every 20 feet, there was a brass plaque that said, no Irish allowed. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1230.0s)]

*  But it's history that speaks above all to the values of the state and these people throughout their hardships in their lives. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1241.0s)]
*  Freedom, equality, dignity, family, courage. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1247.0s)]
*  My mom used to have an expression, Joey, courage is the greatest virtue of all. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1253.0s)]
*  Without courage, you can't love with abandon without courage. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1258.0s)]
*  You cannot love with abandon. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1262.0s)]
*  These are the values that were handed down generation and generation in my family, grafted onto the American character tendon as they transformed an entire nation. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1264.0s)]
*  Like so many countries around the world, though perhaps more than most, the United States was shaped by Ireland. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1275.0s)]

*  It's not just the hope, but the conviction that better days lie ahead. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1342.0s)]
*  It brought us along. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1347.0s)]

*  25 years ago, one of my best friends in the Senate and a great, great friend to this day is George Mitchell. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1763.0s)]
*  As he said, there were 300 days of failure, or 700 days of failure, and one day of success. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1769.0s)]
*  But it was a success that one day. But more is to be done. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1776.0s)]
*  Yesterday, I was in Belfast to honor those who commit themselves to peace, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1780.0s)]
*  to reiterate the enduring support of the United States for the Good Friday Agreement and Northern Ireland's democratic institutions, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1784.0s)]
*  and to help accelerate the enormous economic growth that is opening new futures for young people in Northern Ireland. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1791.0s)]
*  As I pointed out, there are literally hundreds of American corporations ready to come and invest, invest, but they're cautious because their institutions are not in place. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1798.0s)]
*  We must never forget that peace, even as it has become and lived reality for an entire generation of young people, peace is precious. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1809.0s)]
*  It still needs its champions. It still needs to be nurtured. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1818.0s)]
*  The Good Friday Agreement didn't just change lives for the better Northern Ireland. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1823.0s)]
*  It had a significant positive impact across the Republic of Ireland as well. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1827.0s)]

*  how Ireland and the United States can work together with the United Kingdom and the European Union to support the people of Northern Ireland. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1838.0s)]
*  I think that the United Kingdom should be working closer with Ireland in this endeavor. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1845.0s)]
*  Political violence must never again be allowed to take hold in this island. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1854.0s)]
*  Presumption of what I want to say from the United States, but that must be the goal which guides us in all our efforts. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1862.0s)]
*  Because the greatest peace dividend of the Good Friday Agreement is an entire generation of young people. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1877.0s)]
*  These hearts have been shaped not by grievances of the past, but by confidence that there are no checkpoints on their dreams. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1885.0s)]
*  They're writing a new future, a future of unlimited possibilities. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1894.0s)]

*  Stories of Irish grit and genius, saints and scholars, poets and politicians. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1910.0s)]
*  And in the face of it, they're good stories on its face. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1916.0s)]
*  Let's face it. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1920.0s)]
*  But as the poet Boland wrote in her poem, Mother Ireland, she said, I learned my name. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1921.0s)]
*  I rise. I rose up. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1929.0s)]

*  Now. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1933.0s)]
*  Now I could tell my story. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1934.0s)]
*  It was different from the stories told about me. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1936.0s)]
*  End of quote. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1939.0s)]
*  Today, Ireland's story is no one's to tell but its own. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1940.0s)]
*  But the United States will be your closest partner, your most dependable partner and your most enthusiastic supporter of every step of the way. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1944.0s)]

*  Yesterday and always already, Ireland draws its disproportionate amount of foreign direct investment from the United States of America. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=1969.0s)]

*  This is about defending the values handed down to us by our ancestors, keeping the flame of freedom. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2317.0s)]

*  It breaks down on faith in ourselves, our values. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2604.0s)]
*  Because no matter what party we belong to, our values are the same. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2608.0s)]

*  I thank you for honoring us today with your presence and for addressing Boathouse of the Durochtas, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2717.0s)]
*  the fourth such American president. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2722.0s)]
*  And can I sincerely thank Ambassador Cronin, who in her tenure here, Mr. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2725.0s)]
*  President, has served your country with distinction. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2729.0s)]
*  And we thank you most sincerely. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2731.0s)]
*  From your address today and from your visit, not just this week, but in previous times, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2740.0s)]
*  it is obvious that you have a genuine personal pride in your Irish ancestry. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2745.0s)]
*  And today, I'm sure all of us in this chamber will reflect and remember the Irish diaspora in America [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2750.0s)]
*  who share that same sense of pride. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2756.0s)]
*  Your presence in this chamber and by your address today acknowledges the story of immigration [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2758.0s)]
*  as the shared story of our two nations. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2764.0s)]
*  And I do hope, Mr. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2768.0s)]
*  President, that we can see immigration reform, which undocumented Irish looked after during your term of office. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2770.0s)]
*  This week, we as a nation turn another page of history together, La Ceila, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2780.0s)]
*  by commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2788.0s)]
*  And it's important that we salute the architects of that Good Friday Agreement and we thank them today. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2793.0s)]
*  We welcome your visit, Mr. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2799.0s)]
*  President, as a reminder of the role your country has played and continues to play as a broker of peace. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2801.0s)]
*  Too many of us still remember the terrible violence that devastated our communities for decades. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2808.0s)]
*  As you said today and yesterday, we must persist in our work of peace and reconciliation [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2814.0s)]
*  to ensure the positive legacy of the Good Friday Agreement [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2821.0s)]
*  and that it can be fully realized for all those young people you spoke about in your speech. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2825.0s)]
*  Mr. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2830.0s)]
*  President, you said recently about the United States, and I quote, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2831.0s)]
*  Our diversity is and always has been our greatest strength as a nation. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2835.0s)]
*  And you've shown that value and respect for diversity, Mr. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2840.0s)]
*  President, in your lifetime as a politician. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2845.0s)]
*  On a personal level, may I thank you for being one of the first leaders to publicly support marriage equality. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2847.0s)]
*  In your infamous speech, the press... [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2855.0s)]
*  In your infamous Meet the Press interview in 2012 with David Gregory, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2866.0s)]
*  you framed the debate as a simple proposition. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2870.0s)]
*  Who do you love and will you be loyal to that person that you love? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2873.0s)]
*  With this statement, Mr. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2877.0s)]
*  President, you held aloft your respect for diversity and others followed, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2879.0s)]
*  including my very good friend, Enda Kennedy here, who, as part of his government, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2884.0s)]
*  allowed us to have a referendum on marriage equality in our country. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2888.0s)]
*  Mr. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2895.0s)]
*  President, your intervention was a truly transformative moment that changed the political narrative [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2896.0s)]
*  around marriage equality. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2901.0s)]
*  And like the architects of the Good Friday Agreement, who took a risk, you took a risk. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2903.0s)]
*  And I thank you because of you and the generosity of the Irish people, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2908.0s)]
*  I can wear this wedding ring as a symbol of my love for my husband, who is here today. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2912.0s)]
*  There is an old Irish proverb, anáin na báha an tachrú, change is the breath of life. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2925.0s)]
*  Looking ahead, we know that change will be constant, and we will embrace that and keep our positivity. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2930.0s)]
*  We will continue to value and strengthen our special relationship with the United States [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2938.0s)]
*  as we work together on shared global challenges. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2942.0s)]
*  President Biden, I hope that you will continue to support the United States [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2946.0s)]
*  and your family enjoy your visit to Ireland, your ancestral home. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2951.0s)]
*  And I want to welcome your sister, Valerie Biden-Owns, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2955.0s)]
*  who has a very good strong Cork connection, and your son Hunter. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2958.0s)]
*  And on your next visit to Ireland, I hope you will come and visit Cork. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2962.0s)]
*  And as you said, Mr. President, I hope you will continue to support the United States [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2969.0s)]
*  and your family enjoy your visit to Ireland, your ancestral home. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2975.0s)]
*  And as you said, Mr. President, previously, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2980.0s)]
*  North East Pennsylvania would be written on my heart, but Ireland would be written on my soul. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2983.0s)]
*  In conclusion, it would be remiss of me as Cahiric, if I didn't on this occasion, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2988.0s)]
*  thank the members of the House for being here today, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2993.0s)]
*  to thank the staff of the Arachtus who made this event possible. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=2996.0s)]
*  Thank you for addressing the House of the Arachtus. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=3006.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=3010.0s)]
*  Good night, and good luck. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=3012.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=3015.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=3045.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tptUjmRTVTg&t=3075.0s)]
