# H.R. McMaster says relationship with China is “worse” than Cold War between U.S. and Russia
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94)
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=0.0s)]
*  Before I traveled here to Beijing, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=2.0s)]
*  I sat down in Washington with CBS News foreign policy [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=4.0s)]
*  and national security contributor H.R. McMaster [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=8.0s)]
*  to discuss some of the challenges with the U.S. and China. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=11.0s)]
*  The White House has said that there have been an alarming number [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=16.0s)]
*  of increasingly aggressive actions by the People's Liberation Army. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=20.0s)]
*  That's China's military in recent months. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=25.0s)]
*  There was video of a near miss in the South China Sea in the air [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=27.0s)]
*  and then one at sea in the Taiwan Strait recently as well. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=31.0s)]
*  How unusual are these kind of incidents? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=35.0s)]
*  Well, they're not unprecedented, but it's unusual in terms of the quick succession of multiple incidents. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=38.0s)]
*  I think China's sending a message, hey, we're in charge now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=42.0s)]
*  You're finished to the West and to the United States. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=46.0s)]
*  And I think it's indicative of what they hope to achieve, Margaret, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=49.0s)]
*  which is to create kind of an exclusionary area of primacy across the Indo-Pacific region. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=52.0s)]
*  They've laid claim to the ocean in the South China Sea, for example. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=57.0s)]
*  So I think this really calls for us to have a strong response. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=61.0s)]
*  I think, you know, with Secretary Blinken's visit there, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=65.0s)]
*  it may portray a bit of weakness in terms of... [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=68.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=71.0s)]
*  Well, I think we've been so anxious to have this discussion with the Chinese, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=72.0s)]
*  and the Chinese have been really playing hard to get in terms of the discussion. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=76.0s)]
*  I think what they hope with the optics of this meeting, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=80.0s)]
*  and I'm sure Secretary Blinken is quite aware of this, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=82.0s)]
*  is to create a perception that we're going there to pay homage to the Chinese Communist Party, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=85.0s)]
*  because they want to use that kind of perception of China's strength relative to the United States [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=90.0s)]
*  to bludgeon countries in the region and say, hey, time to bandwagon with us. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=96.0s)]
*  This is our era, what they call the new era of international relations. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=100.0s)]
*  Well, arguably, a lot of the Biden administration policies [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=106.0s)]
*  look a lot like the Trump administration policies, at least directionally here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=110.0s)]
*  Relations have been going downhill for years now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=115.0s)]
*  This is the first visit since 2018. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=118.0s)]
*  So if the visit itself, you question, is a risk, how do you make this successful? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=121.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's okay to talk, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=129.0s)]
*  Diplomacy is okay. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=131.0s)]
*  But it's just the conditions under which the discussion is conducted and how it's portrayed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=132.0s)]
*  Location? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=137.0s)]
*  So I think not necessarily location, but just the atmosphere around it in connection with China, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=138.0s)]
*  really, I think, wanting to try to get some concessions in exchange for just the privilege of talking with them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=144.0s)]
*  And this might have to do with some policy decisions about whether or not to restrict, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=150.0s)]
*  or ask allies to restrict chip sales, for example, to Chinese industries. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=155.0s)]
*  I think what's really important to note is that China has not come off the path of aggression. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=160.0s)]
*  You mentioned the People's Liberation Army aggression, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=165.0s)]
*  but a broad range of economic aggression that China's engaged in. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=167.0s)]
*  And so I think it's important just to stick to our guns on this, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=172.0s)]
*  and it's important to have diplomacy with China, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=175.0s)]
*  but let's have also diplomacy with countries that might be sitting on the fence to say, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=177.0s)]
*  hey, your choice, really, at this moment is not between Washington and Beijing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=181.0s)]
*  It's between sovereignty and servitude. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=185.0s)]
*  So one of Secretary Blinken's stated goals is to help open up these lines of communication between the militaries. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=188.0s)]
*  You can't oppose that. You must want that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=194.0s)]
*  No, I think it's important to have those kind of confidence-building measures, ways to de-conflict, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=196.0s)]
*  but it takes two parties to do it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=200.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=202.0s)]
*  One of the obstacles to this is the Chinese Communist Party is so centralized in terms of the power of Xi Jinping [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=203.0s)]
*  that he's unwilling to decentralize communications to anybody else at any time. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=209.0s)]
*  When you meet with Chinese Communist Party officials, Margaret, it's typically they're reading off 5x8 cards. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=214.0s)]
*  I mean, you try to tell a few jokes, make a personal connection. It's really hard to do. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=220.0s)]
*  So when we recently spoke with Bob Gates, the former CIA director and defense secretary, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=227.0s)]
*  he said even in the worst days of the Cold War, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=232.0s)]
*  there was at least a way for the United States and Soviet Union to have communications about these kind of military incidents to avoid escalation. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=235.0s)]
*  That framework does not exist today with China. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=243.0s)]
*  Doesn't one have to be created, or do you think that ambiguity or that risk is a choice? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=247.0s)]
*  We ought to always say, hey, the door is open for that kind of communication. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=255.0s)]
*  But I think it's up to the Chinese Communist Party. It takes two to be willing to have that kind of line open. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=258.0s)]
*  The CCP has become very aggressive, not only against the United States, but a broad range of nations. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=265.0s)]
*  And not even to mention, short of military aggression, how about cyber attacks? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=271.0s)]
*  How about campaigns of economic aggression against Australia and Lithuania and others? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=275.0s)]
*  So I think it's important to look at the behavior of the party because they talk a great game, right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=280.0s)]
*  A new era of great power relationship, a community of common destiny for all mankind. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=286.0s)]
*  That sounds like a great program, right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=292.0s)]
*  That's not what I would want to sign up for, though, with the Chinese Communist Party in charge. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=294.0s)]
*  So recently it was publicly disclosed that China has set up and rebuilt part of its listening facilities that are located in nearby Cuba. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=299.0s)]
*  Secretary Blinken acknowledged that this week. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=310.0s)]
*  To a lot of people, they hear and see something like that and they think of the old Cold War. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=312.0s)]
*  How different is this model? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=317.0s)]
*  It's worse. It's worse because it's a more difficult problem set because of the way that our economies have become interconnected. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=320.0s)]
*  In large measure, based on these flawed assumptions about the nature of the relationship and especially the intentions of the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=328.0s)]
*  That's what we got wrong. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=336.0s)]
*  We thought that we could determine the behavior of the party by the way we engage them. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=337.0s)]
*  But hey, guess what? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=342.0s)]
*  I mean, the Chinese Communist Party leadership had aspirations that went far beyond anything in reaction to what we do. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=343.0s)]
*  And China really does want to establish itself as it sees it at the center. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=349.0s)]
*  What are the key phrases, the key things you were looking for and watching for out of this meeting? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=354.0s)]
*  I think competition and a recognition on our part that the Chinese Communist Party has to change its behavior for there to be a better relationship. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=359.0s)]
*  There's always an impulse in diplomacy to think that a better relationship is an end in and of itself. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=368.0s)]
*  But actually, if the perception is that we're going to make concession after concession just for a better relationship, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=374.0s)]
*  I mean, the outcome could be something that appears like a diplomatic achievement, but it could be a political disaster. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=381.0s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40MSbtQL94&t=387.0s)]
