# Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says judicial system overhaul is an "internal matter"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg)
*  We turn now to Israel, where tens of thousands of protesters marched through Tel Aviv last [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=0.0s)]
*  night in opposition to the government's plans to overhaul the judicial system. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=4.78s)]
*  This is just days ahead of Israel's 75th anniversary, celebrating its independence. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=9.84s)]
*  For more, we go now to the country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=15.74s)]
*  Good morning to you, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=20.14s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=21.62s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=22.62s)]
*  We're glad you are here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=23.78s)]
*  You know, it has been a month since you hit pause on those judicial reforms. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=25.419999999999998s)]
*  At this moment in time, when you need national unity, why not withdraw them? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=30.419999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think there's a broad consensus that we have to make corrections in our judicial [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=35.62s)]
*  system. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=41.66s)]
*  There's obviously a dramatic difference between the views of how, to what extent, and so on. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=42.66s)]
*  But I think this should not cloud the fact that we're celebrating here a modern miracle. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  Israel's 75th anniversary is the change that happened to the Jewish people who were decimated [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=52.38s)]
*  in the Holocaust. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  A third of our people were lost to this independent nation that has become a power in the world. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  And I think everybody unites around that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=65.3s)]
*  You had to cancel a Monday appearance at the largest gathering of North American Jewish [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=67.38s)]
*  leaders in years because of these protest concerns. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  Again, why not withdraw the proposal to overhaul the judicial system, which would get Parliament, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=75.62s)]
*  which is controlled by your allies, authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=81.9s)]
*  Well, I've actually said that I will not accept a blanket ability of the Parliament [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=86.30000000000001s)]
*  to overcome judicial Supreme Court decisions, just as we don't accept that the Supreme [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=92.42s)]
*  Court can abrogate any decision by the Parliament or the government. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=97.34s)]
*  Both sides, both of these extremes actually hinder the balance between the three branches [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=101.26s)]
*  which is exactly what we're trying to bring into balance now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=108.8s)]
*  There is, I think, a difficult and happy middle. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=112.36s)]
*  You're making it sound like this is just a simple debate like any other country, but [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=116.36s)]
*  you yourself used the phrase that you were pausing because you wanted to stop the possibility [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=119.64s)]
*  of civil war. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=124.92s)]
*  That was a phrase you used when you hit pause. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=126.8s)]
*  I want to just lay out for you here what it has done here in the United States. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=128.68s)]
*  Those judicial plans led President Biden to say he won't be inviting you to Washington [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=136.8s)]
*  anytime soon. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm very concerned, and I'm concerned that they get this straight. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  They cannot continue down this road. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  Hopefully the Prime Minister will act in a way that he can try to work out some genuine [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  compromise. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=157.56s)]
*  Biden told you to walk away. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=160.08s)]
*  You seem to be betting that there won't be consequences to alienating your closest ally. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=161.8s)]
*  Well, I value the alliance with the United States, and I value the friendship I've [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=166.76s)]
*  had over 40 years with President Biden. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=170.92s)]
*  I don't think anything will get in that way. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=172.84s)]
*  But it's an internal matter that we have to resolve, and we're doing it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=175.32s)]
*  And the way we're doing it is by seeking a consensus. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=180.12s)]
*  As we speak right now, Margaret, as we speak right now, there are teams of my own party, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  the Likud and the coalition, with teams from the opposition speaking in the president's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=188.44s)]
*  house. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=193.56s)]
*  Fifth or sixth meeting they've had, seeking that compromise that I think is the mark of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=194.72s)]
*  democracies. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=199.84s)]
*  You don't walk away from a problem. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=200.84s)]
*  You try to solve it, but you try to solve it through as broad a consensus as you can. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  No, walk away from your proposal. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=206.76s)]
*  Which would allow parliament with a simple majority to override any decision by the Supreme [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=208.76s)]
*  Court. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=213.4s)]
*  That is your one check and balance on power, very different from the American system. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=214.44s)]
*  I want to ask you about the makeup of your government, because it is impacting U.S. relations. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  Your finance minister calls himself a homophobe. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=222.92s)]
*  He said a Palestinian village should be erased. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=227.04s)]
*  You did say that was inappropriate. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  Your public security minister was rejected from Army service because of past ties to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=231.76s)]
*  an extremist group designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=237.44s)]
*  I know you need to keep your coalition together to prevent a collapse, but are you confident [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=242.44s)]
*  you can rein in people like this? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  I think a lot of them have changed over time, and they themselves say that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=252.2s)]
*  But the important thing to understand is they joined me. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=256.36s)]
*  I didn't join them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=258.48s)]
*  We have by far the largest party in the Knesset and certainly in the coalition. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  There are smaller parties. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=264.44s)]
*  The mainstream policies are decided by me, and that's what I'm doing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=266.2s)]
*  Well, this national security minister I just mentioned, Ben Gavir, who threatened to quit, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=270.44s)]
*  which would have collapsed your government, you promised him a national guard would be [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=275.96s)]
*  established under his control. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=279.92s)]
*  The IDF and your security forces are more than strong. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=281.92s)]
*  He's already gone out and said he wants police to remove Palestinian flags from public spaces. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=286.88s)]
*  What exactly do you think he's going to do with this national guard? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=292.88s)]
*  Well, the national guard is not merely his idea. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=296.12s)]
*  It's a wide proposal, which is, by the way, recognized, was actually proposed by the previous [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=299.4s)]
*  government as well, because you need, Israel has a small police force relative to the size [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=304.0s)]
*  of the population. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=310.12s)]
*  We face, unlike other police forces around the world, we face a constant threat of terror. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  There is a national guard. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  It's going to be under one of our national security, under one of our security arms. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=318.12s)]
*  It's not going to be any individual persons or ministers, militia. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=323.08s)]
*  That's not going to happen in Israel. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  Not under me, and I suspect under one else. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=328.68s)]
*  It's just not going to happen. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=332.08s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=333.08s)]
*  Can you clarify this for us as well, because it's making headlines in the U.S.? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=334.08s)]
*  Politician Meg Olaan said that you are considering appointing her to be Consul General in New [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=337.48s)]
*  York. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=342.68s)]
*  She calls herself a proud racist. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=343.68s)]
*  She's denounced African refugees as Muslim infiltrators and criminals spreading HIV. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=345.48s)]
*  Are you nominating her to actually serve in New York, an incredibly important post for [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=351.32s)]
*  Israel? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=356.36s)]
*  It is indeed an incredibly important post, and anyone I'll nominate, and I haven't done [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=357.36s)]
*  so, will have to abide and will abide by the mainstream positions that I've advocated, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=361.32s)]
*  and I welcome the fact that the United States has a multiracial and pluralistic society. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=366.88s)]
*  So does Israel, and anyone I appoint will have to reflect the value that I attach to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=375.32s)]
*  that quality in our democracy and in yours. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=381.84s)]
*  So you are not appointing her? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  I haven't, but I'm telling you that anyone that I will appoint will abide stringently [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=388.24s)]
*  by that view that I've advocated throughout my lifetime. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=394.56s)]
*  And it's not pro forma, it's not lip service. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  I really believe that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=400.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  It sounds like you're saying she's not coming to New York. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  I want to ask you about some of the Americans coming to Israel. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=406.8s)]
*  Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis is visiting Israel this week, and he's presumed to be [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=409.68s)]
*  running for president here, as you know. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=413.6s)]
*  Do you plan to meet with him? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=415.68s)]
*  Of course, I'll meet with everyone. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=416.88s)]
*  Why not? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=418.56s)]
*  I meet with Republican governors and Democratic governors. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=419.56s)]
*  I'm not avoiding the question, and actually I'm rushing right into it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  I meet with every American representative, governor, senator, members of Congress, and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=425.96s)]
*  I think it's my job, and I think it's important for Israel's bipartisan support in the United [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=432.23999999999995s)]
*  States. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=437.88s)]
*  I make a point of it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=438.88s)]
*  Okay, because for the first time there was a poll from Gallup last month that showed [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=439.88s)]
*  Democrats are likelier to sympathize with Palestinians than with Israelis for the first [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=443.23999999999995s)]
*  time. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=447.84s)]
*  I know it's easy to dismiss polls, but this seems to be a reflection of public sentiment [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=449.44s)]
*  in the United States that relates directly to Israel's influence in America. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=454.44s)]
*  49 percent of Democrats sympathize with Palestinians, 38 percent with Israelis. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=460.6s)]
*  Do you think that matters? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=466.04s)]
*  Yeah, I do think it matters, and I think we have to work harder to persuade our Democratic [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  colleagues, or those of those our Democratic colleagues who forget perhaps that Israel [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=473.88s)]

*  ally than Israel. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=485.4s)]
*  But I'll tell you why I think this happens. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=486.8s)]
*  First of all, it's happening over time. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=488.24s)]
*  It happened over time. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=490.04s)]
*  It's not related to this or that administration in Israel because it happened, it continued [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=491.04s)]
*  under the previous government as well. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=495.12s)]
*  I think there is a demonization of Israel in some of the reports, many of the reports [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=497.32s)]
*  that come out of here. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  And I think there is a portion of the American public that finds it hard to understand that [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  once you enter the realm of nations, you have to act to defend yourself. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=507.92s)]
*  And I think we have to work hard to persuade both sides of the aisle and the independents [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=513.64s)]
*  in between. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=519.48s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=520.48s)]
*  Yes, both sides of the aisle, and in this case Democrats, because we have solid support [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=521.48s)]
*  among independents and solid support among Republicans and considerable support among [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=527.64s)]
*  Democrats, but I'm not going to give up. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for your time this morning. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=534.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-LI5N5odg&t=538.56s)]
