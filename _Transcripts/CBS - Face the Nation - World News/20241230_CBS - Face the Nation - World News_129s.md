# Mystery surrounds South Korea's deadliest plane crash as investigation begins
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs)
*  US aviation officials will assist in the investigation into a deadly plane crash in South Korea over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=0.0s)]
*  the weekend. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=6.2s)]
*  At least 179 people died after the aircraft landed on the runway, sped into a barrier [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=7.2s)]
*  and erupted in flames. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=13.14s)]
*  It's the deadliest plane crash to ever take place in South Korea. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=15.24s)]
*  Two people survived, a male and female flight attendant who were sitting in the back of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=19.42s)]
*  the plane. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=23.2s)]
*  Jean McKenzie from our partners at the BBC has the full report. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=24.2s)]
*  We're at the crash site now and you should behind me just be able to make out the charred [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=29.08s)]
*  tail of the plane. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=33.24s)]
*  This is the only part of the plane that is still intact because that explosion, that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=34.4s)]
*  crash was so severe and there is still so much mystery surrounding the crash. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=39.16s)]
*  We know that the pilot had to make an emergency landing, that he doesn't seem to be able to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=44.6s)]
*  have activated his landing gear, but we still don't know why. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  Now there are reports that a bird got into the engine and caused a fire, but there's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=52.84s)]
*  still a lot that doesn't make sense because birds don't normally cause huge planes like [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=56.92s)]
*  this to crash. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  There are measures built in to protect against this and this was an experienced pilot. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  And South Korea has a good air safety record, but it could be some time before we get the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=67.28s)]
*  full answers to this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=73.4s)]
*  Both of the black boxes, they have been recovered from the crash site here, so the voice recorder [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=75.36s)]
*  and the flight recorder, but the flight recorder has been very badly damaged and so experts [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=79.64s)]
*  are saying it might be many months before they can get the data off that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=84.48s)]
*  It's also taking time to identify the remainder of the bodies. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=88.2s)]
*  Forensic teams are now taking DNA from some of the families. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=92.12s)]
*  Many of them have been sleeping here at the airport overnight up in the terminal building [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=95.68s)]
*  and this comes at an incredibly difficult time for this country. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=100.0s)]
*  There is a lot of political instability and uncertainty after the country ousted its president [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=103.64000000000001s)]
*  just over two weeks ago when he tried to bring this country under martial law. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=109.84s)]
*  So its current leader has only been in office now for just over 48 hours, so this is a huge [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=114.28s)]
*  challenge for him going forward and a huge tragedy for this country. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=119.56s)]
*  G Mackenzie for CBS News in Muang Airport, South Korea. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_ZbSh8YMs&t=124.16s)]
