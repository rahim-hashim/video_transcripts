# Iran launched missiles toward Israel, IDF says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE)
*  I'm Reid Cowan. You've been watching a CBS News Network special report about the ongoing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=0.0s)]
*  barrage of missiles fired from Iran into Israel and all of the fallout that comes from that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=6.22s)]
*  Right now we have the opportunity to talk to CBS News' Robert Berger. He is live now [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=12.5s)]
*  from Jerusalem and we understand a lot of people are still in a shelter and wait to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=16.4s)]
*  see situation there. What can you tell us what's going on right now where you are? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=22.5s)]
*  We just got the all clear from the Israeli military. It looks like this attack, at least [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=27.66s)]
*  for now, is over. Can you hear me? We can hear you just fine. You're saying that it [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=39.7s)]
*  looks like an all clear for now. That's what our correspondent Elizabeth Palmer seemed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  to signal as well. Take us back in time if you will and let us know the first alert that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=50.74s)]
*  this was coming, what you did and what so many people heard on the media there and how [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=56.699999999999996s)]
*  they responded. First we heard from actually from US sources that an attack from Iran was [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=62.3s)]
*  imminent and then I would say well about 45 minutes ago or so we heard sirens and then [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=69.14s)]
*  I went outside here in Jerusalem and it looked like orange shooting stars were falling all [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=78.34s)]
*  over the place. I heard some booms. Those orange shooting stars if you will were apparently [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=85.78s)]
*  shrapnel from missiles that had been shot down and then that came in two waves. There [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=91.7s)]
*  was sort of a break and then there was a second wave and what we're hearing is that nearly [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=98.14s)]
*  all of the missiles were intercepted, that some shrapnel did fall, but no one was seriously [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=103.38s)]
*  injured in this assault. And of course the big question now as we await the sunrise on [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=109.48s)]
*  the other side of the globe where you are, what happens next? Will there be more attacks [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=114.54s)]
*  from Iran into Israel and of course what will Israeli response be especially knowing that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=119.14s)]
*  Israel continues to have the backing of US military support? I'm understanding tens of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=124.22s)]
*  thousands of US troops are amassed there in the region. What response do you anticipate [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=129.46s)]
*  in the coming hours? It looks like according even from Iranian sources that this attack [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=134.38s)]
*  may be over for now, but as you say the big question is what is Israel going to do? How [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  is it going to respond? Just yesterday and last week at the UN Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=147.54s)]
*  Netanyahu warned Iran that if they attacked Israel, Israel would attack Iran. Now this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=153.34s)]
*  happened also in mid-April and Israel's response under US pressure was very mutated. All it [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  did was hit a couple of anti-aircraft batteries next to an Iranian nuclear facility. The question [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=166.96s)]
*  is what will Israel do this time? Will it escalate the situation with some kind of attack [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=175.36s)]
*  from Israel inside Iran? We have to wait and see. So let's contrast that mid-April situation [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=181.52s)]
*  that you talked about when Iran fired those drones into Israel. Always intercepted, the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  Iron Dome got it. However, we're understanding from our partners at the BBC that this was [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=194.0s)]
*  different, that the missiles sent were much faster and that there was some difference [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=198.16s)]
*  between now and April. Yeah, in April they fired 300 drones, cruise missiles and also [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=203.48s)]
*  some ballistic missiles. Now the drones and cruise missiles take a longer time to get [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  here, so Israel was well prepared for that. These ballistic missiles that were apparently [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=217.56s)]
*  fired today and according to Israeli television about 150 were fired. They get here a lot [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=222.44s)]
*  faster, it only takes about 12 minutes and they also carry hundreds of pounds of warheads. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=231.6s)]
*  So this is really a major attack and escalation by Iran and I think Israel, last time they [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=236.48s)]
*  were pressured by the US not to respond but the US has said clearly this time that there [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=245.04s)]
*  would be severe consequences for this attack. The world awaits to see what those severe [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=252.2s)]
*  consequences will be. Robert, please be safe. Thank you so much for streaming with us today. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=258.08s)]
*  We also have an opportunity to get to CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Livsay. He [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  is live from Tel Aviv. Chris, we understand that the all clear has been given at least [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=266.88s)]
*  for now. Take us back in time to what you experienced and then forward to right now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=270.64s)]
*  Yeah, well the all clear may have been given but actually just in the last few minutes [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=277.64s)]
*  we were given another warning on our phone. In fact, it was at that time when people started [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  to come back inside of this car as we speak. But this is where we've been for the past [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=287.8s)]
*  30 minutes up until that point. It was a typical Tel Aviv Tuesday. Everybody was having dinner [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  until all of a sudden we heard those sirens wailing and you know Israelis are usually [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=299.64s)]
*  pretty sanguine about these types of alerts. They're not that uncommon but this was a [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=304.88s)]
*  big one and there was a virtual human stampede. Nobody got hurt but it was just a dash for [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=309.08s)]
*  the nearest bomb shelter and there are many, many of them littered around Tel Aviv. We [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=313.88s)]
*  just got into the nearest one with dozens of other people with their dogs, with their [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=318.38s)]
*  children, many of them having dinner. I mean life goes on as normal but this is the kind [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=322.56s)]
*  of thing that we've been bracing for really for almost two weeks at this point. We started [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  seeing those pagers and beepers exploding in Lebanon, those that belonged to the Hezbollah [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=334.6s)]
*  members and then we saw the head of their military get killed in those targeted strikes. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=342.08s)]
*  And then finally the head of the organization itself, Hassan Nasrallah, was assassinated [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=346.88s)]
*  just on Friday. And so everybody's been bracing for something like this. In the meantime we [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=351.08s)]
*  knew that there were thousands and thousands of missiles at least trained in the direction [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=356.56s)]
*  of Israel and people were expecting to see something big coming from the direction of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=361.64s)]
*  Hezbollah in Lebanon. Instead we've only seen a few hundred rockets here, a few hundred [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=366.68s)]
*  rockets there. Many had suspected that it was because their launchers had already been [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=371.76s)]
*  taken out by Israel. But then the question was well why isn't Iran doing anything about [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=376.28s)]
*  it? And it appears like they answered that question tonight. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=380.96s)]
*  Chris, we understand President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are in the situation [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  room and they are very much staying on top of this. In fact they ordered some defense [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=388.68s)]
*  to help defend Israel and get some of those missiles out of the air. Looks like successfully [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=393.12s)]
*  at this hour some shrapnel hitting the ground. But you are with the people every day and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=397.76s)]
*  we know that there's going to be a military response. The warning is that it would be [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=403.52s)]
*  a severe military response. But what about the response on the ground from the people [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=406.64s)]
*  where you live and where you work, the people of Israel? How are they feeling about this [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=410.68s)]
*  and the escalation? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=415.44s)]
*  You know the people of Israel have been rather downtrodden ever since October 7 when Hamas [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=417.52s)]
*  carried out that horrible massacre and the kidnappings and not to mention the subsequent [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=426.64s)]
*  invasion of Gaza. It's seen immense loss of life on the part of the Palestinians and that's [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=431.84s)]
*  not something that the people of Israel celebrate. And so it's been a hard 11 plus months for [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=436.88s)]
*  them but for the first time ever since Israel has had win after win after win against Hezbollah [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  the much more formidable enemy. This is the enemy that Israel has been preparing to fight [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=447.44s)]
*  for years and years. In fact it just goes to show you how well things have been going [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=452.0s)]
*  for Israel in Lebanon in the past few days compared to how poorly they were going in [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=456.52s)]
*  Gaza. It showed you that they were completely caught off guard when it came to Hamas back [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=461.8s)]
*  on October 7. But they've been ready for this in Lebanon. And so that's they're finally [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=466.36s)]
*  seeing their military do what they're supposed to do. Netanyahu said it last week enough [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  is enough. They're tired of watching Hezbollah fire upon northern Israel for more than 11 [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=479.35999999999996s)]
*  months. You know there are around 70,000 Israelis who have been forced to flee their homes because [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=484.79999999999995s)]
*  not only are they afraid of rocket attacks of which they've been virtually every day [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=490.28s)]
*  but they're also afraid of another October 7 like event. In fact Israel says that they've [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=495.23999999999995s)]
*  captured plans from from some of their recent cross border incursions into Lebanon into [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=499.56s)]
*  Hezbollah territory plans for another October 7 like event. So Israel says that Hezbollah [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=505.88s)]
*  was planning to carry out something like October 7 here again all of this time later. So even [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=512.0s)]
*  though Israelis have lots of mixed feelings about this government the direction of the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=518.0s)]
*  war the last 12 days have been different. They've finally gotten the wind in their sails [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=522.16s)]
*  and they've finally been able to restore deterrence in the region something that had completely [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=526.56s)]
*  vanished. Well as we come up on that terrible October anniversary we are also mindful that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=530.1199999999999s)]
*  while all of this plays out hostages are still being held by Hamas right now. Chris Liv say [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=535.88s)]
*  in front of a shelter right there we're grateful for your report. Please stay safe. Our best [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=541.5999999999999s)]
*  thoughts with you and the people you are with today. Okay. CBS News intelligence and national [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=546.8s)]
*  security reporter Olivia Goss is joins us live right now from the U.S. Department of [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=551.64s)]
*  State Olivia. We understand President Joe Biden Vice President Kamala Harris are watching [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=555.36s)]
*  this closely. Any indication what they mean by if Iran fires and we now know they have [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=559.32s)]
*  there will be severe consequences. What could they be. Sure. And that was a step beyond [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=565.2s)]
*  what we heard the last time in April when there was that direct attack from Iran on [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=572.62s)]
*  Israeli interests. The U.S. sending a very strong message of deterrence telling the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=577.1800000000001s)]
*  Iranians to keep this response measured. As Chris was saying there's there had been [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=581.56s)]
*  widespread expectations that the Iranians had to do something just because of all of [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=586.68s)]
*  the escalatory steps that the Israeli military had been taking taking for weeks and months [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=591.68s)]
*  taking out a top military commander in Beirut assassinating Ismail Hani atop Hamas commander [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=596.76s)]
*  in Tehran in July. Of course those spectacular pager operations that affected hundreds of [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  fighters as well as Iran's ambassador to Lebanon earlier this month culminating with this huge [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=610.84s)]
*  strike on Hassan Nasrallah Iran's sort of most potent leader in the region the head [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=617.0400000000001s)]
*  of Hezbollah and that was a very clear turning point that likely affected Iran's calculus [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=622.2800000000001s)]
*  up until now the U.S. U.S. and Israeli officials had been saying they had been able to forestall [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  a retaliatory strike from Iran with a combination of deterrence and diplomacy. That means not [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=633.32s)]
*  only the U.S. posture in the region but the diplomatic efforts sending messages to the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3pzG92mVQE&t=638.96s)]
