Video Description: Voters across 27 European countries have elected more far-right members to the European Parliament. That body has limited power, but the election wins have moved French President Emmanuel Macron to call for a snap parliamentary election in his country after suffering a major defeat to Marine Le Pen's right-wing party. CBS News foreign correspondent Ramy Inocencio explains.

# What to know about far-right parties' gains in European elections
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo)
*  Well, in Europe, voters in 27 countries have elected more far-right members to the European [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=0.0s)]
*  Parliament. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=6.16s)]
*  That body has limited power, but the vote is having a significant impact. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=7.16s)]
*  The results have prompted French President Emmanuel Macron to call for a snap parliamentary [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=11.36s)]
*  election in his country after suffering a major defeat at the hands of Marine Le Pen's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=16.6s)]
*  right-wing party. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=21.6s)]
*  Our RÃ©mi Nessentio explains. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=22.96s)]
*  I give back to you the choice for the future of our parliament, said French President Emmanuel [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=28.48s)]
*  Macron, dissolving the republic's legislature in a political earthquake. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=33.28s)]
*  After France's far-right parties for the first time won more seats than the parties he supported [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=38.84s)]
*  in Europe-wide elections for the bloc's 720-seat parliament in Brussels. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=43.92s)]
*  Macron's call for a snap election starting June 30th comes days after he and President [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=49.0s)]
*  Biden met to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=53.84s)]
*  If Macron loses further support, that raises the chance Marine Le Pen's far-right national [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=57.36s)]
*  party will gain. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  With talk of telegenic 28-year-old Jordyn Bardella, president of France's National Rally [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=63.48s)]
*  Party becoming premier and Le Pen possibly becoming president in 2027. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=68.36s)]
*  Voters in Germany, Italy, Austria and the Netherlands also sent more far-right candidates, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=74.24s)]
*  some in Germany campaigned using Nazi overtones, to the European Parliament. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=79.08s)]
*  They include candidates who campaigned against immigrants, against support for Ukraine, against [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=84.64s)]
*  climate change policies and against dependence on trade with China. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=89.56s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=93.56s)]
*  But despite the rightward shift, Europe's centre is still holding. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=95.48s)]
*  There remains a majority in the centre for strong Europe. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=99.68s)]
*  In Paris, Macron warned that the rise of nationalists and demagogues is a danger to France, Europe [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=104.92s)]
*  and the world. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=110.48s)]
*  This gamble that this sudden election will shock French voters and keep them from shifting [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=111.58s)]
*  even further to the right. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so Remy is joining us now from London. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=117.78s)]
*  I personally find this absolutely fascinating, Remy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  So four days of voting, more than 400 million people eligible to vote, but I don't know [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=123.94s)]
*  how many people actually come out and vote for the parliamentary elections, for the EU [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=129.1s)]
*  parliamentary elections. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=133.5s)]
*  But what is the European Parliament going to be looking like over the next five years? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=135.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=139.74s)]
*  Basically, European voters have pulled the Parliament 720 seats to the farthest right [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=140.9s)]
*  it's ever been, Enri. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=146.94s)]
*  And we've got a graphic with the provisional results, so we're still waiting for more to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=148.62s)]
*  come in. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=152.3s)]
*  But let's go and bring that up. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=153.3s)]
*  We can take a look at that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=154.3s)]
*  I'll guide you through it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=155.3s)]
*  Generally, the parties on the left side of your screen, those are the reds and the green [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=156.3s)]
*  colours, those sides lost seats. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=161.54000000000002s)]
*  These are parties that are more socially liberal, more globally minded, and that advocate for [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=164.5s)]
*  climate change policies. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=169.94s)]
*  But as you go further to the right of the screen, then those lean centre-right. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  There's a big blue block right about in the middle, the centre-right there, and then more [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=176.98s)]
*  extreme right the further you go. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=180.54s)]
*  These parties all gained seats. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=181.82s)]
*  And it's this spectrum that goes further on, this more extreme side that is causing people [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=184.3s)]
*  anxiety. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=192.1s)]
*  This block includes France's National Rally Party, Germany's AFD party, and Italy's Brothers [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=193.82s)]
*  of Italy party, and those have neo-fascist roots. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=199.82s)]
*  So generally speaking, we can see that the gain to the blue and all the way to the right [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=202.26s)]
*  side of the spectrum here gaining, and the left wing, the more liberals losing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=206.42s)]
*  And that is what's causing anxiety. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=210.82s)]
*  So since I gather that the general feeling about the European Parliament is that it doesn't [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  have a lot of teeth, a lot of strength. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=217.26s)]
*  So I imagine only certain people are going to be kind of motivated to participate in [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=219.54s)]
*  this election. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=223.54s)]
*  That being said, of the people who voted, what is driving this shift to the right? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=225.1s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=229.7s)]
*  Well, ultimately, European voters show that they're more concerned about what's directly [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=230.7s)]
*  and really negatively impacting them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=236.1s)]
*  Immigration we know is one of the biggest issues, and people finally got their vote [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=239.06s)]
*  to say, hey, we have had enough. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=243.34s)]
*  And we can really draw a line from the rise of right-wing politics with a rise in the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=245.66s)]
*  number of immigrants, both illegal as well as illegal that have been coming into Europe [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=249.82s)]
*  over the years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=254.42s)]
*  Voters are also pushing back against climate change policies. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=255.42s)]
*  And we saw that the Greens Party on that graph, it was the green in the green. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=258.21999999999997s)]
*  They lost about 20 seats. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=262.82s)]
*  People don't want to pay for new policies to cut carbon emissions or to pay for electric [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=264.7s)]
*  vehicles, which they're trying to phase out in Europe. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=270.18s)]
*  And there is, of course, the cost of the war in Ukraine. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=273.18s)]
*  Right-wing parties have been saying that they've they've given enough to support Ukraine over [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=276.54s)]
*  the past few years or so. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=280.78s)]
*  Europe has committed most recent most recent estimates, put it at one hundred and fifty [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=281.78s)]
*  five billion dollars. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=286.85999999999996s)]
*  And we know that the war still is going on with Russia looking at the northeast of Ukraine [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=288.17999999999995s)]
*  and Harkiv there. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=292.61999999999995s)]
*  Many people are tired of paying. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=293.85999999999996s)]
*  They want that money to come home, to stay home. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=295.34s)]
*  And that's why we're seeing the rise here in nationalism across so many of these countries, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  especially the top three economies of Europe, Germany, France and Italy, and the rise of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=302.38s)]
*  the far right elsewhere. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=306.73999999999995s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=307.73999999999995s)]
*  So we will see what this means for Ukraine, immigration, climate change over the next [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=308.74s)]
*  several years. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  Remy, thank you so much. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEld1kA5Eo&t=314.78000000000003s)]
