# Trump taunts Trudeau as "governor" of "Great State of Canada" amid tariff talks
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI)
*  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a speech yesterday promised to retaliate if the US imposes tariffs on goods from Canada [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=0.0s)]
*  Trudeau said people in America were quote beginning to wake up to the reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=6.72s)]
*  Expensive close quote now early this morning. Mr [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=14.52s)]
*  Trump responded in a pointed truth social post saying it was a pleasure to have dinner the other night with governor [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=17.48s)]
*  Justin Trudeau of the great state of Canada [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=24.52s)]
*  Trump then said he looks forward to talking more about tariffs with Justin Trudeau [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=28.36s)]
*  PBS News money watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady joins us now Kelly [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=33.4s)]
*  How will this play out to our wallets? That's what we really want to know your wallets my wallet and the people who are watching [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=37.76s)]
*  Yeah, so look if the United States does impose a 25% tariff when Trump takes office [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=45.32s)]
*  It is going to make things more expensive you think about the things that we get from Canada [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=52.0s)]
*  Steel aluminum lumber a lot of the cars that we buy are assembled in Canada or Mexico before [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=56.72s)]
*  They make their way to the United States [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=63.68s)]
*  I think what's really interesting here is when president-elect Trump had first posted all of this on social media [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=65.6s)]
*  We saw Prime Minister Trudeau [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=72.26s)]
*  Come to the table. He flew down to Mar-a-Lago [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=74.48s)]
*  They had a discussion and you and I were talking about this read we were saying [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=76.72s)]
*  Wow, this does look potentially like this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=80.39999999999999s)]
*  Negotiating tactic of threatening tariffs could be working [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=84.0s)]
*  But now you're starting to see that tit-for-tat if you do this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=86.8s)]
*  We're going to slap retaliatory tariffs and we saw this under Trump's first administration the Canadians use very targeted [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=90.32s)]
*  Political tariffs they went after certain industries that were very important to politicians within [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=98.32s)]
*  President-elect Trump's fear of influence and they did that in order to try and put pressure on him of you know [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=103.56s)]
*  Hey, let's not do this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=109.34s)]
*  So I think we're starting to see the beginning of that tit-for-tat trade war if it does happen [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=110.34s)]
*  It's not very good for our wallets read [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=115.18s)]
*  Well, and it sounds like Justin Trudeau is banking on this not working and perhaps being a little bit of political blowback for the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=117.66s)]
*  President-elect before he even takes the oath of office [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=124.26s)]
*  I want to ask you about something that Google has developed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=126.34s)]
*  It looks like they developed a microchip that is at least as smart as Kelly O'Grady [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=129.96s)]
*  Tell us about that quantum computer chip my friend [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=134.16s)]
*  Oh my goodness way way way way way smarter how smart okay, so this is really really crazy read [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=139.38s)]
*  The it passed a test it solved a computing problem that in under five minutes that would have taken a regular computer [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=146.94s)]
*  10 septillion years to do that and just to put that in context that is 10 with [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=155.94s)]
*  24-0s behind it that is longer than the entirety of the history of the universe. So this is a very smart computer [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=161.78s)]
*  What does this all mean? This is really great for Google as they try to one-up IBM Microsoft Intel in this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=169.16s)]
*  quantum tech world [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=176.76s)]
*  What does it mean for us if you get to the point where these companies are able to use these chips this willow chip? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  They're going to be able to solve things like more efficient electric vehicle batteries [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=185.76s)]
*  Design new medicines. It's just a lot of computing power that humans and regular computers [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=191.28s)]
*  Can't do right now in a very short amount of time and that is a huge breakthrough for science read and think about the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=197.16s)]
*  Investments that people would want to make on such a chip putting their money on that technology. That's a whole other conversation [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=204.68s)]
*  So Kelly want to ask you about another thing. It's a big development big tech open AI [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=210.76s)]
*  Of course, we know the artificial intelligence company behind chat GBT. They just launched a new AI tool [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=214.52s)]
*  It's called Sora. Am I saying that correctly? It converts text to video [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=220.76s)]
*  What do you know about that and what does it mean to the future of the AI race? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=224.96s)]
*  So this is the next evolution of the AI chatbot, you know chat GBT [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=230.28s)]
*  Of course is open AI is one and the idea is you or I we could go type in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=235.28s)]
*  I want to see read and Kelly in a video going shopping at the mall [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=240.04s)]
*  Okay, and then in you know your milliseconds [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=245.4s)]
*  It's going to put out this video for you up to 20 seconds of video [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  That would show something like that and you can refine it with text now [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=253.72s)]
*  You have to pay for it in order to get access to this feature. That's that's the beginning part [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=257.32s)]
*  But there are some safety protocols behind this if you're going to put text or any images into Sora you have to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=261.84s)]
*  Testify that it is not showing anyone under the age of 18 [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=270.76s)]
*  No violent or explicit content because of course they don't want that out there [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=274.16s)]
*  But Rita have been talking to a number of folks in the space about Sora and the fear is well [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=278.6s)]
*  Even though these images and these videos are going to be watermarked indicating their AI generated [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  That you could see something out there that goes viral on social media. That is just simply not real [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=288.48s)]
*  So there's always those safeguards that you have to think of as well. My goodness from hey Siri to hey Sora. Hey Sora [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=294.26000000000005s)]
*  Show read count with the abs of a 20 year old somebody do that for me. Kelly O'Grady CBS News money watch course [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=301.56s)]
*  You you laugh my friend [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=307.28s)]
*  Okay, I know. Thank you so much for talking to me. Great to see you Kelly as always [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKajg9y8jQI&t=309.78s)]
