# Russian President Putin agrees with Trump and what it means
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I)
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin says he's ready for talks with the U.S. and is repeating [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=0.0s)]
*  some of President Trump's own statements about the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=4.28s)]
*  In an interview on Russian state television, Putin said he agreed the war could have been [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=8.02s)]
*  avoided if President Trump was in the White House. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=11.48s)]
*  He also said he's ready to discuss nuclear arms control and economic issues with the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=13.84s)]
*  U.S. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=18.28s)]
*  The Russian military launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost three years ago. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=19.28s)]
*  Putin's remarks come two days after President Trump posted on True Social about ending the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=23.52s)]
*  war, saying in part, quote, If we don't make a deal and soon I have no other choice but [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=27.16s)]
*  to put high levels of taxes, tariffs and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=31.52s)]
*  States. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=37.72s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd joins us for our weekly national [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=38.72s)]
*  security wrap up. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=42.18s)]
*  Sam, what do you make of Putin's remarks? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=43.18s)]
*  I think this is manipulation by Putin at its best. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=45.72s)]
*  President Putin is repeating very publicly to President Trump everything that President [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=49.96s)]
*  Trump wants to hear in an effort to probably manipulate President Trump into trying to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=54.32s)]
*  push for a very specific deal to end Russia's war with Ukraine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=59.4s)]
*  President Putin said, for example, that the 2020 election was stolen, that the war would [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=66.0s)]
*  never have happened if Trump was in office and more. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=70.44s)]
*  Now, President Trump, for his part, is using a combination of carrots and sticks to try [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=73.44s)]
*  to get Putin to the negotiating table. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=78.32s)]
*  Remember, Trump at one point said he would end this war within one day if in power. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=81.0s)]
*  Well, he's now changed his tune a bit and has given his special envoy for Ukraine, General [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  Keith Kellogg, 100 days to negotiate an end to this war. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=90.72s)]
*  Trump has threatened taxes and tariffs and other sanctions against Putin while also indicating [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=95.72s)]
*  that he'd like to speak with him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  Putin has expressed his own openness to connecting with President Trump. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=102.91999999999999s)]
*  So I do think that we should expect a call between the two leaders in the near term. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=106.72s)]
*  Let's turn to another topic here in the U.S. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  The Trump administration has pulled the security detail of multiple former officials. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=113.84s)]
*  People recognize the names, including former National Security Adviser John Bolton, former [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=118.84s)]
*  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former top health official Anthony Fauci. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=122.28s)]
*  What's the significance and do these people still face threats? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=126.64s)]
*  President Biden extended federal security protection for three individuals that you've [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=130.88s)]
*  named that were involved in President Trump's Iran policy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=136.68s)]
*  And then President Biden extended security protection for Dr. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=140.28s)]
*  Anthony Fauci when he left federal service just a couple of months ago. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=143.68s)]
*  This was based, Lindsay, and I was involved in a lot of these discussions. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=148.96s)]
*  This was based on a very complex threat assessment that showed that there were active threats [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=152.56s)]
*  against these individuals based on their time in public service. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=157.72s)]
*  And they warranted security protection because those threats were very real. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=163.52s)]
*  There is, to our knowledge, no analysis that these threats have diminished since President [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=168.12s)]
*  Trump came into office and said arguably the threats against these individuals have increased [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=173.76s)]
*  over the past couple of weeks with the inauguration, the past couple of days with the inauguration [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=178.8s)]
*  of President Trump, increased vitriol against Dr. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=182.88s)]
*  Fauci for his role in COVID-19, as well as President Trump's likely policy towards Iran [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=186.32s)]
*  over the coming months. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=191.68s)]
*  This does look like retribution rather than a threat based assessment of what's needed [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=193.08s)]
*  to keep these individuals safe from threats from Iran. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  And in Dr. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=201.4s)]
*  Fauci's case, threats from likely anti-government violent extremists. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5BhSb5lS0I&t=202.12s)]
