# Biden prepares for NATO summit amid pressure to bow out of 2024 race
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A)
*  World leaders are arriving in the United States here in Washington today, ahead of a three-day [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=0.0s)]
*  NATO summit. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Leaders from NATO's 32 member countries, as well as several allies of the alliance, are [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  gathering in Washington to mark 75 years since NATO was formed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=12.32s)]
*  During today's White House briefing, National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  indirectly slammed former President Donald Trump while defending President Biden's work [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=22.28s)]
*  with the alliance. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=27.64s)]
*  Rather than browbeaten and insulting and demeaning allies, this president has invested in allies [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=29.2s)]
*  and partnerships. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=35.6s)]
*  The president's record speaks for itself. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=36.6s)]
*  And the allies and the non-NATO friends and partners that are coming as well, they know [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=38.28s)]
*  that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=43.04s)]
*  They wouldn't be coming, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, to a NATO summit if they didn't [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=44.04s)]
*  believe in American leadership and how important it is, and if they didn't believe that President [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=50.28s)]
*  Biden takes that responsibility extremely seriously. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  And our Major Garrett is with me now in our DC studio, Major. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=57.92s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  So 75th anniversary of NATO. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=63.24s)]
*  That would have been a big headline in and of itself. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=66.4s)]
*  Of course, though, all eyes are on the president, his condition, and these growing calls from [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=68.4s)]
*  within his own party to step aside from the ticket. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=74.6s)]
*  How do you assess what the president has to do here with all these world leaders? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=79.12s)]
*  So what was meant to be a celebration, 75 years of NATO, launched in Washington, D.C., [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  75 years ago. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=90.08s)]
*  So it's a kind of a full circle moment in the history of the alliance, is overshadowed [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=91.44s)]
*  by the president's political difficulties and what will inevitably be, Kaitlyn, persistent [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=97.28s)]
*  questions to world leaders and those traveling in their retinue. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=102.84s)]
*  What do you think about Biden? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=106.76s)]
*  How does he look to you? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=108.28s)]
*  What is his firmness or capabilities, as you've seen them in the three and a half years of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=109.84s)]
*  his presidency? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=115.48s)]
*  Those stories are going to engulf this entire celebratory atmosphere, plus deliberations [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=116.92s)]
*  about what exactly will become the future of Ukraine and NATO. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  What is a bridge? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=128.6s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=129.6s)]
*  Is it five years? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=130.6s)]
*  Is it 10 years? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=131.6s)]
*  And what will the alliance do to help the Ukrainians not only survive this summer, but [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=132.6s)]
*  prepare for what appears to be an inevitable and brutal winter with power system generation [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=136.6s)]
*  failing in Ukraine because of persistent Russian missile and artillery attacks? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=143.04s)]
*  How does Ukraine carry on credibly, militarily and hold its country together against the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=148.16s)]
*  ongoing Russian onslaught, intensified even in the last 48 hours by more than two dozen [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=154.76s)]
*  or three dozen civilian deaths? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=160.72s)]
*  So all of that is part of this, but Biden is central to this, but in ways he was not [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=162.52s)]
*  expecting to be central to it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  And I've been talking to Democratic lawmakers over the weekend and they say, look, don't [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  talk about Biden. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=175.84s)]
*  Don't criticize. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  Don't get disunified. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=178.56s)]
*  You'll overtake the NATO summit. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  They're like, hey, the NATO summit's already overtaken. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=182.88s)]
*  That's inevitable because of the debate performance. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=186.12s)]
*  So you have something that is a freestanding event, all planned. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=188.76s)]
*  The communique has largely been written. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=193.76s)]
*  Much of what the alliance is going to say has already been predetermined. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  But that thrust will be interrupted by all of the president's other side political problems. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=207.2s)]
*  And I know we've said a lot this year and in political years, the stakes are high. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=208.2s)]
*  Of course, this is an instance where the world is quite literally watching and watching how [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  Biden is going to do. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=215.1s)]
*  The White House said today he's going to have a press conference around the NATO summit. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=217.56s)]
*  Obviously, big spotlight on him for lots of reasons that you just described. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=223.08s)]
*  But in your conversations with Democrats, how are they kind of looking to how he handles [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=227.24s)]
*  that moving forward? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  There's this great conversation by great, I mean, consequential. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=235.16s)]
*  Democrats don't know what to do. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=240.88s)]
*  They have two realities. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=242.96s)]
*  One, the president doesn't want to budge. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=244.56s)]
*  And two, DNC rules that will oversee the Democratic National Convention allow him to stay if he [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=247.08s)]
*  doesn't want to budge. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  So those are two facts. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=255.4s)]
*  The great conversation is what do we do about those facts because anxiety about the president's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=257.88s)]
*  ability not only to articulate the message, to carry the fight to Donald Trump, but to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=263.44s)]
*  rebound in places that everyone knows are going to be close, the seven battlegrounds, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=268.08s)]
*  but also restore Democratic prospects in places that looked three weeks ago pretty [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=274.0s)]
*  secure. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=279.32s)]
*  Virginia, New Hampshire, Minnesota. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=280.32s)]
*  If those are on the map, that is dreadful for Democrats. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=282.48s)]
*  They can't have those states on the map. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=286.84s)]
*  They need to reassess. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=289.68s)]
*  And they're trying to reassess and say to the president, are you the best person at [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=290.68s)]
*  this moment? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=296.44s)]
*  Biden says, guess what I am. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=297.44s)]
*  They have doubts, but they don't know how to translate those doubts into action. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=300.52s)]
*  And so you have a lot of inaction and a lot of people talking on cable television, a lot [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=304.96s)]
*  of frantic text messages going back and forth, but not much else. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=309.4s)]
*  And if all you've got is cable news and text messages, you're not going to dislodge a sitting [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=314.08s)]
*  president who wants to be renominated and has twice as many delegates as he needs. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=318.64s)]
*  And is completely dug in, as we've seen from his comments today. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=322.78s)]
*  I want to talk about Donald Trump because uncharacteristically for him, he has kind [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=326.8s)]
*  of been taking the back seat and letting this news cycle play out. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=332.24s)]
*  Of course, that rule in politics, let your opponent kind of suffer if they are. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=336.92s)]
*  But when it comes to NATO, I mean, he's famously been critical of NATO, famously been critical [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=341.84s)]
*  of our allies not paying enough into the alliance. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=346.52s)]
*  How does that kind of factor into how the world leaders are kind of thinking about this, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=350.76s)]
*  heading into this summit? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=355.76s)]
*  So when President Biden in one of the exchanges that was not hampered by his otherwise poor [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=357.64s)]
*  performance at the debate asked former President Trump a question, will you get out of NATO? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=366.88s)]
*  And Trump shrugged, no answer. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=373.24s)]
*  Now, I covered NATO summits where President Trump was there, and I saw him hector and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=375.96s)]
*  cajole and insult, but not in a vacuum. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=381.22s)]
*  Those harsh words did send some of those nations sort of back to their budget books and they [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=386.74s)]
*  did meet the 2% gross domestic product threshold on defense spending. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=392.02000000000004s)]
*  But those numbers have increased under Biden's administration. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=397.5s)]
*  So that was Trump's real concern about NATO. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=399.82000000000005s)]
*  He ought to, broadly speaking, be celebrating what's happened. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  NATO countries than ever, 23 of 32, are now at that 2% number, which is a vast improvement. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=407.14s)]
*  It improved under Trump. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=415.06s)]
*  It improved ever so slightly under Obama when this actual hectoring really began. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=417.14s)]
*  Robert Gates, the defense secretary under President Obama, set this all in motion, but [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=421.26s)]
*  it's gotten better consistently. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=425.21999999999997s)]
*  Trump should celebrate that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=427.86s)]
*  You don't hear anything about that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=428.86s)]
*  And that shrug at the debate sort of encapsulated in a personal way his indifference toward [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=431.14s)]
*  the NATO alliance, which while they're talking about Biden, they're also going to be talking [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=436.86s)]
*  to themselves while they're here. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=442.22s)]
*  Oh my gosh, is it going to be Trump? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=443.58000000000004s)]
*  And if so, how do we protect NATO? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=445.46000000000004s)]
*  How do we protect Europe from either that indifference or that sort of Putin-friendly [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=447.98s)]
*  low-level hostility? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=453.22s)]
*  That's the other conversation we'll be going on this week here. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=455.6s)]
*  We'll be paying attention to how world leaders are being asked and what they say to questions [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=457.54s)]
*  about the current president as well. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=462.3s)]
*  Major Garrett, thank you as always for your time and reporting. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXj0s_oRC6A&t=464.38s)]
