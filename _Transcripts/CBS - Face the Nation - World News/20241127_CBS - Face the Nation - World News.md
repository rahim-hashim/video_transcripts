# China releases 3 Americans after years of detention, White House says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4)
*  Moving on, three Americans have been released from China's custody today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=0.0s)]
*  The Biden administration announced their return home as part of a prisoner swap with Beijing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=4.0s)]
*  So at least one detainee remained imprisoned for over a decade. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=8.76s)]
*  The group maintained their innocence for years, saying they were wrongfully held in China. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=13.4s)]
*  The National Security Council releasing a statement following the White House announcement, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=18.92s)]
*  saying, quote, soon they will return and be reunited with their families for the first [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=22.8s)]
*  time in many years. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=28.0s)]
*  Thanks to this administration's efforts and diplomacy with the PRC, all of the wrongfully [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=29.2s)]
*  detained Americans in the PRC are home. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=35.68s)]
*  CBS News congressional correspondent Scott McFarland breaks this all down for us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=39.6s)]
*  So do we really have any details about the three Americans and how this swap actually [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=44.32s)]
*  played out? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=48.36s)]
*  Mark Swiden is the one who's been in custody in China for more than a decade since 2012. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=51.44s)]
*  Kyle Lee and John Lung are the other two. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  We know over the past few months, their families have been fiercely advocating for their release [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=60.12s)]
*  and for the Biden administration and for the Congress to intervene as needed to help secure [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=65.8s)]
*  their release because of the length of their detention and because of the unjustified nature [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=70.8s)]
*  of their detention. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=75.68s)]
*  Lee and Lung were accused of espionage, Swiden of a drug offense that the families and their [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=77.24s)]
*  advocates, including their advocates in Congress, have said were unjustified, unwarranted and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=82.68s)]
*  were not substantiated. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=87.68s)]
*  The release comes, according to national security officials, right before the Thanksgiving holiday, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=89.64s)]
*  but we're not getting information yet as to how the U.S. secured them, what they offered [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=94.2s)]
*  in return to get the or who they offered in return to get these three Americans released. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=98.76s)]
*  Yeah, and Scott, I know that you do have the court document involving an Arizona man that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=104.12s)]
*  made death threats to President-elect and his family. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  So what more do we know about those threats? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=112.24s)]
*  A much different case. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=115.88s)]
*  Manuel Tamayo Torres is from the Phoenix area, charged now in the federal court system in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  Southern California, accused of making a threat or a series of threats against the president-elect. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=121.08s)]
*  And according to the 16-page court filings, these were vulgar, violent threats directed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=126.08s)]
*  towards Donald Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=132.32s)]
*  What's more, Tamayo Torres is facing a series of firearms charges. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  According to the prosecutors, he made unlawful, untruthful statements to secure the purchase [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=137.76s)]
*  of guns, alleging that he didn't have a criminal past and wasn't deemed a threat previously [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=144.56s)]
*  in his life, where the prosecutors say he does have a criminal past and has been accused [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=149.88s)]
*  of menacing and harassing others in the past and making those gun purchases illegal. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=154.68s)]
*  There is no listed defense attorney yet for Tamayo Torres. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=160.72s)]
*  No plea has been entered. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=163.64s)]
*  No comment can be received yet about these accusations, but they are particularly striking [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  accusations in the wake of the two assassination attempts against Donald Trump, another violent [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=169.44s)]
*  threat allegedly made against him. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  Scott McFarland, Scott, thank you so much. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UyFMst8vB4&t=176.92s)]
