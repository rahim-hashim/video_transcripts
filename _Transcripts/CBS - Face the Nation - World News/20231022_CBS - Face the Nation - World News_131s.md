# Israel resumes airstrikes in Gaza and hits rare target in West Bank
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0)
*  We begin in Israel with Charlie Dagata. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=0.0s)]
*  The full force of Israeli airstrikes and artillery resumed overnight and this morning. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=2.64s)]
*  And a rare airstrike in the West Bank on a suspected Hamas terror cell in Jenin. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=12.72s)]
*  Two weeks of heavy bombardment has left Gaza in ruins with a death toll that surpassed [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  4,300 people, another 13,000 injured. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=25.36s)]
*  There had been a brief lull with the release of American hostages Judith Ronan and her [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=29.92s)]
*  daughter Natalie from Chicago, the first and only hostages to emerge from captivity. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=36.2s)]
*  Rescuing the rest in the middle of an expected full-scale invasion presents an unprecedented [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  challenge, the former head of an Israeli Special Forces unit told us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=48.32s)]
*  This is the responsibility of the state of 200 hostages, infants, wounded. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=52.8s)]
*  There's no way the country can move without taking this into consideration. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=58.48s)]
*  This would be an element in the handling of the war. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=63.6s)]
*  A war Israeli forces are readying more than 350,000 reservists for. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=67.2s)]
*  What we've witnessed is a steady buildup of hundreds of thousands of Israeli troops and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=74.16s)]
*  heavy equipment like this in staging areas all pointed in one direction about a mile from Gaza. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=79.56s)]
*  The stated aim of the complete destruction of Hamas means an invasion on a scale never seen [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=86.04s)]
*  here before. Former Major General Israel Ziv once commanded Israeli forces in Gaza. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=93.44s)]
*  We're completely changing the tactics. We're going to use a lot of fire. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=99.6s)]
*  We don't want to play to their hands, to their traps, to whatever they prepare for us. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=105.48s)]
*  This morning the Israeli spokesman said that that strike on a suspected [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=112.2s)]
*  terror cell in Jenin eliminated what he called a ticking bomb while the wave of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=115.88s)]
*  attacks overnight in Gaza City resulted in the deaths of dozens of Hamas militants. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=121.72s)]
*  That's Charlie Daggett reporting from Tel Aviv. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkYHeghez0&t=128.6s)]
