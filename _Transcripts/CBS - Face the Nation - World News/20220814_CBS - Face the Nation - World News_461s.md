# McCaul says "there was no plan" ahead of U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4)
*  Biden administration released an updated assessment on al Qaeda in Afghanistan, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=0.0s)]
*  citing intelligence community reports that the terror group is no longer [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=4.42s)]
*  assessed to be a threat in that country. Tomorrow marks one year since the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  chaotic collapse of the Afghan government as U.S. troops prepared to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=13.68s)]
*  leave. And while the administration's full report on the much criticized [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=17.28s)]
*  withdrawal is still a work in progress, the top Republican of the House Foreign [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=21.12s)]
*  Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul's report is complete. He's here with us. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Good morning to you, Congressman. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=30.4s)]
*  This deserves a full conversation, and I want to get to it. Let me do this bit of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=31.68s)]
*  business though first on the events of the past few days. Senator Marco Rubio, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=36.76s)]
*  who's the vice chair of Senate Intelligence, issued a letter [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  saying he's outraged not to have been briefed, and he blasted the FBI saying [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  that they have done more damage to faith in the rule of law than the Russian [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Federation or any other foreign adversary. Is his anger misplaced? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=55.52s)]
*  You know, I think it comes on the heel. I think the Wall Street Journal did a [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=60.64s)]
*  great article about how, you know, after the Russian collusion, Steele d'Assier, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=63.88s)]
*  everything took place during the Trump presidency and now out of office to have [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=68.04s)]
*  this raid take place. Look, I'm a DOJ alumni. I worked at Public Integrity here [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=72.68s)]
*  at Maine Justice, and what I worry about, Margaret, is the lack of trust in our [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=78.08s)]
*  and faith in our institutions. That concerns me most above all, and I think [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=84.32s)]
*  when you saw the DHS bulletin about, you know, potential threats now to the agents, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  this is the whole fabric of our democracy, and they have lost faith. Many [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  have in the FBI and our institutions. I hate to see that as a former federal [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=100.52s)]
*  prosecutor. Understood, and there is something like a healthy skepticism [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=106.72s)]
*  about law enforcement, certainly, but for the former president to be using the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=110.44s)]
*  language that he is when there is this level of threat against FBI agents, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=113.8s)]
*  would you call on him to tone it down? I think it's inflammatory. I don't want to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=118.88s)]
*  put any law enforcement in the bullseye of a potential threat, and that's someone [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=123.6s)]
*  who's worked with law enforcement most of my career. This is an extraordinary [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=130.44s)]
*  case, and what lawyers we call a case of first impression. We've never had a [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  former president of the United States serve the search warrant. There was a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=139.96s)]
*  subpoena. The court could have enforced the subpoena. That should have been a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=143.56s)]
*  last stage process, and I would also agree with Brian Fitzpatrick, right? The [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=146.88s)]
*  affidavit in support of the warrant will give you the probable cause to try to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=152.48s)]
*  understand what is going on here, and I think the American people deserve this, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=157.76s)]
*  and I certainly think to Rubio's point that the Gang of Eight should have been [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=162.48s)]
*  briefed, and I believe that the relevant committees on the Hill should have [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=166.4s)]
*  access to the documents, but most importantly, this affidavit. Yeah, well, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=170.04s)]
*  we will see. It sounds like it may take some time to get some of these answers. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=175.28s)]
*  I want to talk to you about Afghanistan. Um, I've read your report. The State [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=180.12s)]
*  Department says there are about 74,000 vulnerable Afghans still stuck waiting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  for these visas to exit the country who worked with the United States [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=191.6s)]
*  government. Your report says the State Department knew, going back well into [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=195.92s)]
*  the Trump administration, that it needed more staff, that it needed more [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  resources to even begin to help get these people out, and that's before the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  chaos of the withdrawal. Is that one of the prime sort of sins here that you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  see in terms of failure to plan? There are many sins, if you will. There was a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  complete lack and failure to plan. There was no plan, and it was there was no [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=220.16s)]
*  plan executed. And to, you know, to your point, you know, even beforehand, I think [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=225.32s)]
*  the State Department probably didn't have the resources it needed to carry [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=231.48s)]
*  out an evacuation of this size and enormity. They had 36 consular officers [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  at H.K.A. trying to process hundreds of thousands of people. They were [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=240.16s)]
*  overwhelmed, but there are so many mistakes. The biggest one, Margaret, for [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=244.88s)]
*  me, having lived through it, you know, being in the classified space, listening [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=248.84s)]
*  to the intelligence community tell the story about this is going to be imminent. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=253.52s)]
*  It's going to fall sooner rather than later. The military said it told us the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=258.12s)]
*  same thing, and then we went to state, and they paint in the White House a very [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=262.48s)]
*  rosy picture. There's a disconnect between, you know, intelligence on the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=266.72s)]
*  ground and what the White House is doing. I think in this report, this says it all, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=271.40000000000003s)]
*  like there's no way we're going to evacuate embassy personnel from [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  helicopters like we did in Vietnam. And of course, we know that happened. Well, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=278.56s)]
*  the criticism of this report will be that this was the minority report that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=282.96s)]
*  it's inherently political. And now when Republicans take the majority, if they [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=287.56s)]
*  win the majority in November, that this is going to be just a political line of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=292.44s)]
*  attack. How do you respond to that? You know, I was a federal [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  prosecutor longer than a member of Congress, so it's been almost 20 years [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=300.84s)]
*  now. And I pride myself as being objective. I think this is a fairly [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=304.12s)]
*  objective report about the failures that were made. You know, one of the biggest [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=309.0s)]
*  ones was that the Taliban sitting with Zalqawi, he's out of the special envoy, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=312.84s)]
*  and General McKenzie, the CENTCOM commander, made an offer, you can take [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=317.44s)]
*  control over Kabul and secure it for purposes of the evacuation. General McKenzie [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=321.96s)]
*  said, that's not my assignment here. Not my assignment? That's not what the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=326.88s)]
*  commander-in-chief told me. They do run it up to the White House, and they get no [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=329.4s)]
*  response, and then later Jen Psaki says they wouldn't have approved that. Think [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=333.32s)]
*  about what that would have changed. We had to rely on the Taliban to secure the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  perimeter of H-Khaya. That led to the chaos. It also led to the suicide bomber [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=341.36s)]
*  that killed 13 servicemember men and women and injured over hundreds of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  people. And it could have been avoided. You know, the current US Special Envoy for [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=352.76s)]
*  Afghan Women and Girls was out of government when this was going on. She's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=359.2s)]
*  quoted in your report as saying she still struggles to understand how this [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=362.88s)]
*  supposedly pre-planned, negotiated, inevitable withdrawal ended the way it [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  did. It feels so much like living Schindler's List. That's a pretty [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=370.52s)]
*  powerful criticism. Who specifically needs to be held accountable, if anyone [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=375.64s)]
*  here? And is it simply just the matter of this was an intelligence failure, that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=382.2s)]
*  the government would fall as quickly as it did, that the former president would [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=388.2s)]
*  have fled? How do you respond to that? That there was an inability to plan for [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=391.96s)]
*  this because it was not predicted? Well, the intelligence community got it right, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=396.76s)]
*  so there's no failure on the intelligence side, nor the Pentagon. They [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=399.92s)]
*  called it right. The problem was the White House and State Department [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  putting their head in the sand, not wanting to believe what they were saying, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=410.0s)]
*  and therefore not adequately planning. And I think to your point, the women left [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  behind is the worst of this entire story. I got four busloads of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  little girls from a music school out, but the Schindler's List, you know, if [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=422.72s)]
*  you're on the list, you're going to live. If you're not on the list, you're [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=427.92s)]
*  probably going to die. 100,000 Afghan partners left behind. Remember, we said, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=430.64s)]
*  we will protect you. That was our promise to them. No one left behind, and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=435.6s)]
*  we left them behind to the mercy of the Taliban, and now they're being tortured [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=440.12s)]
*  and killed. Well, the State Department says that it has tried to comply with [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=444.32s)]
*  your committee. We await their full report of their own actions. Thank you [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=448.64s)]
*  for sharing your findings. They have not. They have not. They've not. They've [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  not complied with our investigation at all. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=456.44s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for your time today. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTnnkCR-Si4&t=459.08s)]
