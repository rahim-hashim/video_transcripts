# Protesters in South Korea rally for President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs)
*  So video to our monitors takes us to protests in South Korea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=0.0s)]
*  The people you're about to see want the Korean president [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=3.94s)]
*  impeached after he declared martial law last week, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=6.78s)]
*  shocking a lot of people all around the world. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=9.92s)]
*  CBS News' former correspondent, Remy Inosencia, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=12.0s)]
*  reports opposition parties, they are determined [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=14.22s)]
*  to boot the president and find a new way forward [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=16.68s)]
*  on the Korean peninsula. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=19.3s)]
*  South Korea's opposition Democratic Party legislators [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=21.44s)]
*  have vowed to hold an impeachment vote every single week [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=24.72s)]
*  until President Yoon Suk-yul is impeached, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=28.54s)]
*  riding a tide of anger that we witnessed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=31.86s)]
*  with our own eyes Saturday night at a massive, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=34.86s)]
*  massive rally outside the country's legislature. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=37.58s)]
*  That's the National Assembly. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=40.2s)]
*  It's estimated about 150,000 protesters had gathered [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=41.64s)]
*  from across the country to pressure lawmakers [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=45.84s)]
*  supporting the president to impeach him. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=48.74s)]
*  And that's because he declared martial law last Tuesday [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=51.14s)]
*  in what appears to be a huge miscalculation [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=54.28s)]
*  to consolidate power, to try to break political deadlock [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=57.14s)]
*  with the Democrats and blaming North Korea, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=60.74s)]
*  but still with no evidence that he has provided. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=63.54s)]
*  But that impeachment vote on Saturday failed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=66.78s)]
*  because most of the lawmakers of the president's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=69.14s)]
*  own ruling conservative party walked out of the chamber. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=71.38s)]
*  The Democrats chanted at them to come back, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  but they did not. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=78.18s)]
*  And that meant there weren't enough lawmakers [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=79.7s)]
*  to even qualify to hold a binding vote. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=81.66s)]
*  Before that, I interviewed the speaker [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=85.08000000000001s)]
*  of the National Assembly. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  His name is Woo Won-shik, and he said that South Korea's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=88.72000000000001s)]
*  democracy is not that fragile. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  That's why we won't retreat. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=95.76s)]
*  We will risk everything, even my life. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  South Korea's democracy will continue. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  It will be difficult for any forces [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  to regress the country's democracy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=104.92s)]
*  And South Korea's democracy has existed since 1987, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=107.68s)]
*  born out of repressive authoritarian governments [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=112.12s)]
*  who use martial law themselves. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=115.12s)]
*  And that's why so many South Koreans were so enraged [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=117.12s)]
*  because the president's own martial law declaration [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  brought up horrors of the past. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=123.44s)]
*  Now, the next vote to impeach the president [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  is set for this Saturday, but this political K-drama, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=128.08s)]
*  if you will, could last weeks, months, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=132.72s)]
*  and possibly even years through 2027, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=134.96s)]
*  because that is when the next presidential election [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=139.08s)]
*  is currently still scheduled for. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=142.04s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  CBS News, foreign correspondent Remy Inosentio. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9umRUU5UiHs&t=147.2s)]
