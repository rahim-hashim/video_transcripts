# What Trumpâ€™s tariff plan means for the steel industry
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg)
*  One day after announcing a plan to impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=0.0s)]
*  and Mexico and an additional 10 percent on products from China, President-elect Trump [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=4.64s)]
*  selected trade attorney Jameson Greer to be U.S. trade representative under his new administration. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=9.32s)]
*  Greer will work to impose the trade plan Trump announced Monday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=14.8s)]
*  CBS News spoke with the owner of Columbus Hardware in New York about the potential impact [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=18.04s)]
*  of the policy on small businesses. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=22.28s)]
*  Our prices would go up. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=24.96s)]
*  We would be paying more for every object that came from China, Mexico, Canada. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=26.54s)]
*  Therefore we'd have to put that onto the customer. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=31.419999999999998s)]
*  They look at the prices here and if we're not pretty even with those competitors, they [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=35.46s)]
*  won't buy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=41.78s)]
*  Catherine Cobden joins us now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  She's the president and CEO of the Canadian Steel Producers Association. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=44.54s)]
*  Thank you so much for spending time with us this evening. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=49.14s)]
*  The trade relationship between the U.S. and Canada is two-sided. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=51.58s)]
*  Roughly how much steel is imported and exported between the two countries? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=54.54s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=60.1s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=61.1s)]
*  We're each other's largest trading partner in steel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=62.1s)]
*  So about 20 percent of all the steel consumed in the United States, or the imports consumed, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=66.18s)]
*  is from Canada. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=73.98s)]
*  And about 40 percent of the imports consumed in Canada are from the United States. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=75.42s)]
*  So we're really each other's largest trading partner. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=80.66s)]
*  Catherine, what sectors would be most impacted by tariffs like this and how soon would the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=84.1s)]
*  consumer feel the impact? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  So the sectors that will be most affected will be the sectors like automotive sector, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=93.74s)]
*  the energy sector, the construction sector, infrastructure. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=100.06s)]
*  So that is the consequence of tariffs that between trading partners like ourselves is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=104.9s)]
*  that consumer prices will rise. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=111.74000000000001s)]
*  I think the tariffs are a legitimate tool and it will be really important to talk about [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=114.98s)]
*  how we put tariffs on bad actors like China. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=120.5s)]
*  The U.S. candidate in Mexico have a 2020 trade agreement that's up for review in 2026. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=124.98s)]
*  Would new tariffs imposed by the U.S. violate any aspects of that? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=129.82s)]
*  Well, currently, the entire principle of USMCA is free trade and tariff free trade between [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=135.17999999999998s)]
*  our two nations and Mexico. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=143.77999999999997s)]
*  So obviously, trade experts are saying that that might be a challenge. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=145.82s)]
*  But again, I go back to tariffs are a legitimate tool on bad actors. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=151.77999999999997s)]
*  Canada and the U.S. have the exact same tariffs on China. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=156.94s)]
*  That's really where I hope we can concentrate our discussions moving forward. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=161.26s)]
*  Yeah, let's talk about those discussions. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=165.57999999999998s)]
*  Are you hoping you or other stakeholders can come to the table with Trump and renegotiate? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=167.14s)]
*  What are the next steps here? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=171.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we see the next steps as really being our government sitting down with President-elect [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=173.22s)]
*  Trump's new administration once they're in office and really beginning a dialogue, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=178.54s)]
*  constructive dialogue and real actions that can be taken to ensure that bad actors instill [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=184.86s)]
*  trade and there's plenty out there that we're working together for economic thriving by [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  our both of our industries, both sides of the border and working against those countries [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=198.94s)]
*  that are practicing unfair trade and dumping steel into our mutual marketplace. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=205.74s)]
*  Catherine Cobden, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=211.82000000000002s)]
*  Great, thanks for having me. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvvWEtI0rg&t=214.74s)]
