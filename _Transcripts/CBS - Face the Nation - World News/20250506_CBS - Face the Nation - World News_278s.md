# Trump announces U.S. will stop targeting Houthis in Yemen
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0)
*  President Trump hosted newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=0.0s)]
*  The meeting came at Carney's request in an effort to reset relations between the neighboring countries a week into his tenure. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Carney campaigned on the promise that he will stand up to President Trump's harsh comments and economic actions in the months following his inauguration. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=11.16s)]
*  25% tariffs on Canadian goods not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement went into effect March 4th. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=19.04s)]
*  President Trump has blamed Canada for allowing fentanyl to be trafficked into the U.S. and has repeatedly floated the idea of annexing the country and making it the 51st state. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=25.84s)]
*  While Prime Minister Carney emphatically declared Canada is not and won't ever be for sale, the president later responded with, never say never. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  And during the Oval Office meeting between the two world leaders, President Trump broke the news regarding Houthi rebels in Yemen. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  We had some very good news last night. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=51.88s)]
*  The Houthis have announced that they are not, or they've announced to us at least, that they don't want to fight anymore. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=53.800000000000004s)]
*  They just don't want to fight. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=60.32000000000001s)]
*  And we will honor that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=61.92s)]
*  And we will stop the bombings. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=65.0s)]
*  And they have capitulated. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=69.88s)]
*  But more importantly, we will take their word. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  They say they will not be blowing up ships anymore. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=77.44s)]
*  And that's what the purpose of what we were doing. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  So that's just news. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  We just found out about that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=83.92s)]
*  Senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe following all this for us. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=86.16s)]
*  A lot of news coming out of that Oval Office meeting. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of that particular statement? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=92.0s)]
*  Well, that comes, of course, as Israel has targeted them and as the president is preparing to head to the Middle East early next week. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=94.2s)]
*  We're trying to learn a little more about why he's come to this decision. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=101.36s)]
*  But certainly, perhaps an encouraging development after several months of bombings, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=105.76s)]
*  they're targeting the Houthis out of concern about them targeting Israel, but also targeting ships in the Red Sea. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=112.48s)]
*  Prime Minister Carney won, as we mentioned, by running on an anti-Trump platform, talking tough against the administration and its rhetoric. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=119.84s)]
*  How would you describe the tone of today's meeting and the status of their relationship? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=127.44s)]
*  Oh, that was a... [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=131.12s)]
*  That one could have gone either way, for sure, Lindsay. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=133.04s)]
*  It seemed that Carney maintained a sort of diplomatic approach there, at least publicly, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=135.84s)]
*  interjecting a few times to remind the president that Canadians are not interested in being annexed by the United States [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=142.68s)]
*  and suggesting that they have some work to do on rebuilding or reshaping the U.S.-Canadian economic relationship. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=148.72s)]
*  But you could see there in the body language between the two of them, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=155.72s)]
*  Trump knows that this thing he's boasted about for months has no way of happening, at least in the short term, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=157.96s)]
*  and even later brought it up again, well, maybe one day it'll happen. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=165.28s)]
*  And Carney's saying, no, never, it will not happen. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  Anything short of that for Carney to have said to his face here at the White House today would have been a big political failure for him back home [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=171.36s)]
*  as he was elected, in essence, because of Trump, because of what Trump had been saying, and because of Carney's vows to stand against it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=178.28s)]
*  So this was his chance to do so today, and at least publicly he did so. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=184.84s)]
*  We'll wait to see what went on behind closed doors. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=188.36s)]
*  They're wrapping up their lunch meeting here, and Carney is expected to speak a little later this afternoon here in Washington before going home. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  You had mentioned sort of the back and forth between them. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  Let's go ahead and play that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=202.72000000000003s)]
*  We should, yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=203.84s)]
*  It would really be a wonderful marriage because it's two places they get along very well. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=207.52s)]
*  They like each other a lot. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=212.12s)]
*  Well, if I may, as you know, from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  That's true. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=221.28s)]
*  We're sitting in one right now, you know, Buckingham Palace that you visited as well. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=221.88s)]
*  That's true. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=225.6s)]
*  And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign last several months, it's not for sale, won't be for sale. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  The president's saying, so you're saying there's a chance. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=235.32s)]
*  Carney's like, nope, that's not what I'm saying. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=237.83999999999997s)]
*  What were your other takeaways from the meeting? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=240.0s)]
*  They clearly have some differences between them that are going to have to get sorted out. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  But Trump did start the meeting by suggesting, look, I have respect for Carney for the fact that he won this race. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=246.28s)]
*  Of course, he won the race because he ran against Trump. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=251.76s)]
*  He ran against his rhetoric. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=254.76s)]
*  He ran against everything he's tried to do to the U.S.-Canadian relationship. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=255.88s)]
*  But hey, a win is a win. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=259.32s)]
*  And this president has signaled before he likes winners. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=260.44s)]
*  And so we'll see whether he's able to develop a professional, courteous relationship with Carney or if it devolves into the one similar to the one he had with Justin Trudeau, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=263.2s)]
*  who at the end, of course, he was calling governor because of his push to make Canada another American state. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=271.48s)]
*  Adokie, thanks as always. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxtAm6t_K0&t=276.28000000000003s)]
