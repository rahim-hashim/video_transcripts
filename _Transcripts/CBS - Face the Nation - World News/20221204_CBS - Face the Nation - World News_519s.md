# Incoming House Intel chair on Ukraine, China and Trump
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ)
*  And we turn now to Ohio Congressman Mike Turner, the top Republican on the House Intelligence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=4.68s)]
*  Congressman Turner, good to have you here in person. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=5.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=7.84s)]
*  Yes, it's great to be here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=8.84s)]
*  So just yesterday, the director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, said that Russia [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=10.28s)]
*  was perhaps struggling to keep up with the amount of munitions that it's using in this [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=14.64s)]
*  war in Ukraine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=19.16s)]
*  The cold weather is slowing combat. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  The secretary of state, though, didn't really give hope for diplomacy at this moment. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=22.6s)]
*  Given what you know, when will this war end? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=27.96s)]
*  Well, the one thing that we know is that the gains that Ukraine is making are real. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=31.32s)]
*  They're real in the battlefield. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=36.96s)]
*  They're real in the support that they have around the world, with democracies on the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=38.68s)]
*  floor of the United Nations, and condemning this aggression by Russia. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=43.4s)]
*  But Ukraine really has to be the one that decides that if, when, and how negotiations [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=48.56s)]
*  are entered into. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  And at this point, they're battling for their country. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  They're losing lives for democracy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=56.84s)]
*  President Zelensky says, I was just in Ukraine just before the elections, he says openly, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  he understands that he's the front lines for democracy and he's fighting an authoritarian [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  regime. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=68.92s)]
*  And I think, you know, obviously, Russia has to reevaluate how they look at this conflict [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=69.92s)]
*  and how Putin looks at what he is starting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=76.84s)]
*  So you agree with the administration on this? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=79.48s)]
*  I agree, absolutely, that this is something where, you know, this is a war of aggression [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=81.36s)]
*  that Russia needs to reevaluate and to withdraw from Ukraine. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=86.72s)]
*  You've said because you are poised to run the Intelligence Committee, since you are [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=90.52s)]
*  the top Republican, when Republicans take control in January. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Is this going to be an area where, as you promised, you can take politics out of it [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  and actually work across the aisle? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=104.36s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=106.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, when I went, we went on a bipartisan trip to deliver to President Zelensky a message [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=108.63999999999999s)]
*  that there's bipartisan support for Ukraine. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=114.36s)]
*  I think there's a number of issues that we're going to be working on a bipartisan basis. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  What should the United States policy be? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=120.28s)]
*  How do we make certain that they serve on the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=121.92s)]
*  Committee? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=124.44s)]
*  How do we make certain that they get the weapon systems that they need? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=125.44s)]
*  How do we hold together this world alliance that we have where the world is condemning [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=128.2s)]
*  what Russia is doing? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=132.6s)]
*  And of course, the expansion of NATO. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=133.6s)]
*  We're looking forward to Sweden and Finland joining NATO, which is the opposite of what [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=135.28s)]
*  Putin believed he was going to achieve in attacking Ukraine. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=139.84s)]
*  He now sees the expansion by two valuable partners with great military capabilities [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  joining NATO. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=148.28s)]
*  I want to show our viewers some pretty extraordinary video that the Pentagon unveiled this week, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=150.2s)]
*  a B-21 Raider. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=157.0s)]
*  It's the first U.S. nuclear stealth bomber aircraft in more than 30 years, and it's being [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=158.44s)]
*  packaged as this deterrent to China. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=164.28s)]
*  How concerned are you about the pace of Beijing's nuclear development? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=168.64s)]
*  Extremely. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=173.11999999999998s)]
*  And I want to commend the administration because they've been very forward-leading in releasing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  and declassifying information about what China is doing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  They are expanding their nuclear weapons, their nuclear weapons capabilities, their [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=183.0s)]
*  ICBMs that are targeting the United States. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=186.83999999999997s)]
*  This plane is incredibly important. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=188.76s)]
*  I served as chair of the Air and Land Subcommittee as we, on a classified basis, began the process [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  of working on this plane. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=194.48s)]
*  It gives us an additional balance because it's an additional delivery vehicle, additional [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=197.28s)]
*  way to combat what China's doing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  To drop nuclear weapons. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  To cause people not to drop nuclear weapons. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=205.12s)]
*  That's what's so... [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  It's really the deterrent. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=209.32000000000002s)]
*  It is to make sure that the balance of power is there so that people understand that the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  cost is just too great. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  When China is expanding their nuclear weapons, they're looking at the United States. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=217.96s)]
*  If we blink, if we don't respond, then they assume that they can get first strike capabilities [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=221.0s)]
*  that not only holds us at bay, but really holds us at risk because then you have the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=226.28s)]
*  leader of a nuclear power that might make that miscalculation and of course cost unfathomable [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=230.32s)]
*  lives. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  You talked about being open about intelligence. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm wondering, in your new role, will you be asking the director of national intelligence [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=240.92s)]
*  for a briefing and a damage assessment related to Mar-a-Lago and the documents the former [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=245.32s)]
*  president took to his private home? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=250.76s)]
*  That's already in process. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=252.72s)]
*  It hasn't happened. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=253.72s)]
*  In the new Congress, when you asked for it? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=255.24s)]
*  It has not, but it's been largely a sketch. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=256.24s)]
*  Yes, and I've just talked to the director of national intelligence about this particular [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=257.56s)]
*  issue. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=261.0s)]
*  One issue that I've discussed with the director, which is very, very interesting, is that prior [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=262.0s)]
*  to the Mar-a-Lago raid, no one in the intelligence community or in the national security community [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=266.84s)]
*  was engaged at all by the FBI to request an assessment as to what the risk of the documents [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=274.36s)]
*  that had been surrendered from Mar-a-Lago or that might have been at Mar-a-Lago or that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=280.08s)]
*  were even perceived as being missing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=283.64000000000004s)]
*  And you think the justice department should have... [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=285.12s)]
*  This was just the FBI and the archivist, which is basically a glorified librarian, coming [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=286.76000000000005s)]
*  together and deciding to raid Mar-a-Lago. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=293.12s)]
*  But you're not downplaying that taking classified material to your private home is a problem [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  particularly for the commander-in-chief. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=301.12s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=302.12s)]
*  There were other options that the FBI had versus the escalation that they did. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=303.12s)]
*  That certainly is going to be one of the questions we have. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=306.6s)]
*  The director of national intelligence indicated they have conducted their risk assessment [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=309.16s)]
*  and they are prepared to give both of our committees on the Senate and the House a presentation [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=313.48s)]
*  as to what those are. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=319.12s)]
*  Do you have a sense of when or what the scale of the damages? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=320.12s)]
*  At this point, it's just a scheduling issue. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=321.96s)]
*  We just had a meeting with the director, both Senator Warner and myself and Adam Schiff. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=323.16s)]
*  And as they look to how do we get everybody scheduled together and those who have done [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=330.08s)]
*  the assessment, because again, it's not just the director that will be coming, they'll [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=334.48s)]
*  have to come forward to give us what did they see, what do they have, and how do they perceive [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=337.92s)]
*  the threat that may or may not have existed from some of these documents? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=343.16s)]
*  This may seem a basic question, but all elected leaders swear to uphold the Constitution. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=347.04s)]
*  Does calling for suspension, is that disqualifying for presidential candidates? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=352.92s)]
*  It's certainly not consistent with the... [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=357.56s)]
*  You know I'm asking the question. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=358.56s)]
*  I do. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=359.56s)]
*  It's certainly not consistent with the oath that we all take. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=360.56s)]
*  So yesterday, the front runner for the Republican nomination, the standard bearer for your party, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=362.64s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, first of all, I vehemently disagree. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=370.04s)]
*  with the statement that Trump has made. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=399.88s)]
*  Trump has made, you know, a thousand statements in which I disagree. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=401.96s)]
*  There is a political process that has to go forward before anybody is a... [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  Constitutional conservatives are pretty clear about where they value the Constitution. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=413.96s)]
*  Is there any scenario with suspending the Constitution? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=414.96s)]
*  You do get to pick the questions, but I do get to pick my answer. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=417.23999999999995s)]
*  I know, I'm trying to get you to answer the question I'm asking. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=419.79999999999995s)]
*  There is a political process that has to go forward before anybody is a front runner [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=422.64s)]
*  or anybody is even the candidate for the party. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=426.48s)]
*  Do you condemn him saying something like this? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=431.52s)]

*  This is atrocious. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihK08NUBwQ&t=459.88s)]
