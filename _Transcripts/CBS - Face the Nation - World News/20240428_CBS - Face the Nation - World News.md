# Israeli strikes hit what is mostly a tent city in southern Gaza
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM)
*  We begin today with foreign correspondent Debra Pada in Jerusalem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=0.0s)]
*  Like most days in Raffa, this one began with mourning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=5.68s)]
*  After more Israeli strikes hit what is mostly a tent city in the south, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=13.52s)]
*  sheltering over half of Gaza's 2.3 million Palestinians crammed up against the Egyptian [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=18.080000000000002s)]

*  only war her entire life. It's been a brutal week for children. Even miracle baby Sabrin Al Roo, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=32.08s)]
*  who was saved from her dying mother's womb a week ago, lived just five days. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=40.08s)]
*  She's been buried next to the rest of her family. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=46.8s)]
*  Raffa is already under daily bombardment, but Israel keeps threatening a ground invasion, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=49.6s)]
*  and Palestinians who've already fled multiple times keep asking, where will they go? Much of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=57.52s)]
*  Gaza lies in ruin. The destruction on such a scale, it is uninhabitable. This morning, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=64.16s)]
*  more humanitarian aid was airdropped over the territory, and this idea footage shows the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=71.2s)]

*  acutely malnourished. Prior to October 7, hardly any. And despite an increase in aid, the UN says [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=97.36s)]
*  it is still not enough to avert famine, which could spread across the north next month. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=105.92s)]
*  Ahead of a possible Raffa invasion, there are now last-ditch attempts to revive ceasefire talks. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  Hamas has stepped up the pressure by releasing propaganda videos that show three hostages, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy58JXbgWkM&t=118.72s)]
