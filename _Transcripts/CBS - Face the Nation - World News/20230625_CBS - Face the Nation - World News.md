# Halting Ukrainian grain exports risks "starvation and famine," warns Cindy McCain
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [June 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8)
*  We turn now to the global hunger crisis and our conversation with the new executive director of the United Nations World Food Program [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=0.0s)]
*  Cindy McCain [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=7.96s)]
*  She spoke to us Thursday from New York where she addressed the UN Security Council about what she called a spiraling [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=9.08s)]
*  hunger crisis in parts of the world [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=16.0s)]
*  There are a lot of fires in the world right now. There's a lot going on [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=18.6s)]
*  There's a lot of countries that are in deep distress [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=22.0s)]
*  Somalia being one of them and so we're spread pretty thin right now [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=25.12s)]
*  And so to be able to continue the work that we do obviously we meet we need more help [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  But we need the world to pay attention to us also and make sure that people understand [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=34.24s)]
*  It's not just a security crisis in Somalia. It's a humanitarian crisis as well [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=38.84s)]
*  I know you recently lost some employees in Sudan [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=44.52s)]
*  Where the United States has pulled out because of the violence there [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=50.0s)]
*  Are you still able to feed people despite the war? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=54.44s)]
*  Well, we never left Sudan we we stalled for a little bit we paused for a few days because you're correct [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=59.24s)]
*  We did lose three people there and we had to evacuate our other [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=66.06s)]
*  Citizens our other nationals as well as our international people out [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=71.04s)]
*  But we never left and so we are now again. We're back in we're distributing food again reminding everyone [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  It's extraordinarily dangerous there right now. So our methods and how we're doing it were it are a little bit different [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=82.82000000000001s)]
*  But we also have asked the UN to please guarantee us a humanitarian corridor for us to be able to work and operate [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=88.78s)]
*  So we can deliver our food. I know the US is the largest [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=95.58000000000001s)]
*  Financial donor to the World Food Program and the UN having given [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=100.22s)]
*  7.2 billion dollars more than all other donors combined last year [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=105.06s)]
*  Meanwhile the world's second largest economy China gave [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=110.62s)]
*  11 million dollars [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  How receptive is Beijing to your requests? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=117.42s)]
*  Well, I'd like to encourage Beijing to get involved and be a part of this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  We need not only do we need their funding but we need their expertise on many things there their technology [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=125.5s)]
*  with regards to agriculture [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=132.98000000000002s)]
*  And the technology with regards to to climate change can be very helpful in these countries that are really struggling with [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=135.22s)]
*  drought and lack of food etc [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=142.14s)]
*  Is the issue that the government wants credit and so therefore they want to do it under their own flag and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=144.42s)]
*  Not through the international system, which you represent. I [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=151.14s)]
*  Think to some degree you're correct on that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  I think it's also just a willingness to be a part of working together as a team worldwide [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=157.66s)]
*  In these countries that were in one agency cannot do cannot do the job [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=164.17999999999998s)]
*  We need partnerships and so we encourage the Chinese and we encourage many [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=169.38s)]
*  Encourage many other countries around the world to partner with us [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=174.1s)]
*  You know in the room when you are trying to pitch the Security Council you are looking at the United States [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=177.14s)]
*  You were talking to China. You're also talking to Russia [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=182.78s)]
*  In addition to some other members, but I want to pick up specifically on the Kremlin because they said [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=186.94s)]
*  This past week there were no grounds to extend the Black Sea grain initiative [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=192.78s)]
*  That is the deal under which Russia agreed to allow grain to leave the ports of Ukraine a country. It is militarily [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  occupying [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=204.82s)]
*  That's arguably weaponizing food [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=206.34s)]
*  What's the impact if that deal goes away? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=209.78s)]
*  Well, the impact is again, we're short on grain and what does that mean it affects? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=212.98s)]
*  A large portion of Africa. We're also short on fertilizer fertilizers the other half of this [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  That's come that's supposed to be coming out and so without the fertilizer in many cases [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=223.14s)]
*  They're not going to be able to grow crops that are as large or as productive as they could be [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=227.38s)]
*  For all the things that are going on [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=233.26s)]
*  I truly wish that we could end this war so that we could begin again to feed [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=235.33999999999997s)]
*  People around the world and and so that the Ukrainians can also feed themselves [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  What's at stake here is starvation and famine. That's what we're looking at [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=245.38s)]
*  There's been an uptick in migrants to the United States from Haiti, which is now largely [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=249.82s)]
*  controlled by gangs [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=254.74s)]
*  How do you keep the food you are getting into that island nation out of the hands of? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=256.34s)]
*  Criminals and into the mouths of starving children. Well, you're exactly right. The importance is is that the international community needs to be in there [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=261.74s)]
*  The importance is is that the international community needs to be in there [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=269.06s)]
*  to not only help keep the country safe, but to but to help us be enable our [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=273.14s)]
*  Organization other organizations to be able to move the grains around and move food around in general [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=278.58s)]
*  The idea in in Haiti, which is such a lush tropical island island [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  But it is also affected by climate change is also affected by by you know, by land use [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=288.7s)]
*  I think the world community has taken a step forward and kind of forgotten Haiti a little bit [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=294.58000000000004s)]
*  So so my job having returned from Haiti is to remind the world that Haiti is still there [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=299.22s)]
*  It still needs our help. It still needs food [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=304.66s)]
*  It still needs security and it needs to be able to prosper in a way so that they don't lose a generation of children [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=307.42s)]
*  broadly speaking extreme weather is a factor that's affecting crops and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=314.94s)]
*  Migration you've said climate change is influencing the situations in a number of the examples you just gave [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=320.18s)]
*  Where are you seeing it impact the most? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=326.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, one of the places is the Sahel [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean that if you could see what's down there and see the the impact that the the climate change has had on it [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=332.26000000000005s)]
*  So what we're what we are doing with regards to the Sahel and other regions particularly in Africa is water management [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=341.02000000000004s)]
*  Teaching ancient ways which are very simple to do and climate change not just in Africa or the Sahel [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=348.82s)]
*  Climate change is worldwide and we're going to be seeing you know [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=356.26s)]
*  We're having to manage crops now that are they have to be more resilient to drought [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=360.3s)]
*  Our animal feed and things have to be more resilient so the animals can be more resistant to drought [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=364.65999999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of things at stake here [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=369.98s)]
*  And I think when people talk about climate change and and those naysayers that think climate change isn't real [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=372.5s)]
*  I'd like to take them to the Sahel and show them what's real [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=378.92s)]
*  Cindy McCain at the United Nations. Thank you [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=381.9s)]
*  Thank you [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azmTY8V3on8&t=385.22s)]
