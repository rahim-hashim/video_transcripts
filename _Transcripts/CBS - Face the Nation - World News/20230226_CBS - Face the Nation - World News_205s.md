# Ukraine marks one year since Russian invasion with no sign of peace in sight
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A)
*  Friday marked one year of the war in Ukraine, a sobering day around the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=0.0s)]
*  Our Charlie Dagata was in Ukraine when the war started, and he filed this report from Ukraine for us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=4.96s)]
*  It's up to you. I was thinking that this is the front line. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=11.44s)]
*  We're taken to an unspecified front line position north of Bakhmut. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=14.24s)]
*  Two things about Ukrainian soldiers. They're really sensitive about sharing locations for [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=19.04s)]
*  obvious reasons. And they really don't want us to get hurt. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=25.2s)]
*  Outgoing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=30.64s)]
*  Friends. Friends. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=37.36s)]
*  Friends. Friendly fire. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=38.64s)]
*  Some incoming, some outgoing. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=41.2s)]
*  What do you want to do? This is the front line. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=44.64s)]
*  I know. Stay close to the building, they tell us. Split up. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=47.44s)]
*  Russian mortar teams aim for people in clusters. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  One of the soldiers was a mortar guy himself and said if he was on the other side, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  he would have already launched a volley at us by now. So we hurry to get on with the job. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=58.4s)]
*  Okay, let's try one. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=64.24s)]
*  The sound of explosions has been nonstop, both outgoing and incoming. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=67.84s)]
*  This is the last Ukrainian-held village before the Russian front line, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=74.0s)]
*  about three miles in that direction. Commanders tell us the front line has only moved a few [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=77.76s)]
*  hundred yards in the past couple of months. In some cases, the soldiers are holding off [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=82.56s)]
*  the Russians using no more than automatic weapons. This is what a stalemate looks and sounds like. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=88.0s)]
*  We need to wrap soon. Really? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=97.84s)]
*  Yes. Is it getting that hot? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=99.68s)]
*  They're really worried. The explosions haven't stopped the entire time that we've been here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=101.6s)]
*  Is it always like this? Always. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=106.72s)]
*  Always. If it feels like the world is growing weary of this senseless war after a year fighting, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=109.28s)]
*  imagine how Ukrainians feel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=116.88s)]
*  We were here when the invasion began, when the capital itself was coming under attack, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=120.72s)]
*  and each time we've returned, we've been shocked by the staggering and growing toll of the war. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  Even in virtual ghost towns like Staryi Saltiv in eastern Ukraine, the few residents who remain [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=132.8s)]
*  still manage a kind of life, sustained largely with the help of volunteers, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=139.28s)]
*  food and aid from around the world. Raisa Fativa survived the Russian occupation [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=144.72s)]
*  and the months of bombardment that followed when they pulled out and pummeled the neighborhoods. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=152.08s)]
*  So this is when it began. This is the occupation. So May, June, July, August, September. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=158.96s)]
*  Getting aid to the other side of the river is more difficult. The Ukrainians blew up the bridge, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=167.44s)]
*  forcing the Russian retreat. This temporary pedestrian bridge will do for now. They don't [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=172.96s)]
*  want to allow vehicles to cross in case the Russians try to come back. The sheer sadness [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=179.52s)]
*  and unnecessary suffering can be overwhelming. Just over a year ago, most of this country was [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=186.08s)]
*  at peace. Overnight, the entire country was at war, a brutal war with no end in sight. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  This is Charlie Dagata reporting from Ukraine. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRMyKzf42A&t=201.28s)]
