# Trump signs executive order cutting financial assistance to South Africa
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E)
*  South Africa is one of the latest countries President Donald Trump has targeted since taking office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=0.0s)]
*  Last week, the White House issued an executive order completely cutting off financial assistance to the country. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=6.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Deborah Panna has the latest on this from Johannesburg. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=12.0s)]
*  President Trump's decision to cut off aid to South Africa and offer white Afrikaans farmers asylum [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=17.0s)]
*  is based on what many in this country say is a false narrative. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=23.0s)]
*  The reality is far removed from Trump's executive order, which followed a post on social media by the president, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=28.0s)]
*  stating that South Africa was treating certain classes of people very badly and expropriating land without compensation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=34.0s)]
*  Afrikaans writer Pete Crocombe told CBS News that white South Africans have benefited more from democracy [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=43.0s)]
*  than any other group in this country. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=51.0s)]
*  If you're white, he says, this is still the land of milk and honey. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=54.0s)]
*  One of the largest agricultural organizations in the country has also publicly stated that no land has been expropriated in South Africa [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=59.0s)]
*  without compensation in the 31 years since the country's first always election. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=68.0s)]
*  South African legislation allows the government to expropriate unused land for public use for fair compensation, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=74.0s)]
*  which has raised criticism among some opposition parties. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=82.0s)]
*  And the group most affected by the withdrawal of U.S. funds will be the eight million people living with HIV in South Africa. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=86.0s)]
*  Trump's order stops hundreds of millions of dollars a year that the U.S. gives to help with the country's HIV AIDS response. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=93.0s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=101.0s)]
*  Deborah Panna in Johannesburg, thanks. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foGrHXuwY3E&t=102.0s)]
