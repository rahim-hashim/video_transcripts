# Pressure mounts on South Korean president ahead of impeachment vote
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs)
*  Pressure is mounting on South Korea's president after his attempt to impose martial law on the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=0.0s)]
*  The head of his own party is now calling for him to be removed. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=4.7s)]
*  And this all comes as lawmakers are set to vote on impeaching the president tomorrow. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=7.7s)]
*  Our Remy Nascencio has more from Seoul. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=12.3s)]
*  And that historic impeachment vote to oust President Yoon Suk-yol is set to happen here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=15.9s)]
*  This is the country's legislature known as the National Assembly. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=21.7s)]
*  And it's set to happen Saturday early evening someplace between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=25.6s)]
*  That's what we're told by the speaker of the assembly. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=31.2s)]
*  Now President Yoon Suk-yol on Tuesday, late Tuesday, declared martial law which shocked the country and the world. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=34.4s)]
*  But he then backtracked after just six hours from political and social pressure. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=42.1s)]
*  And that pressure on him is continuing through today. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=47.0s)]
*  The leader of his own conservative party said he now backs impeachment. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=50.5s)]
*  This is from his own party. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=54.7s)]
*  He said he was afraid the president would try to declare martial law again. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=56.300000000000004s)]
*  The defense minister resigned yesterday and took blame for martial law. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=60.6s)]
*  But then the country's new acting defense minister said he would actually defy any second declaration of martial law if the president tried that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  Opposition leaders are also alleging the president planned to round them up and detain them outside the capital. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=73.7s)]
*  And the speaker of the legislature, Woo Won-sik, who I spoke to earlier, said pointed out really that when the president declared martial law, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=80.5s)]
*  military helicopters landed here and dispatched troops to try to cordon off the area from legislators and from people trying to get in to stop him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=89.7s)]
*  But he made it a point to say that now he is prepared for that possibility. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=100.4s)]
*  If we pan out just a little bit, zoom out just a little bit, you can see cars and buses all around here on the front lawn of the National Assembly. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=105.8s)]
*  The point here is that the speaker of the assembly has in effect made this into a parking lot so those helicopters would not be able to land. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=112.8s)]
*  Now, if President Eun is not impeached Saturday evening, we do expect just massive, massive protests to roll across South Korea and across the capital. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=121.7s)]
*  Remy Innocentio, CBS News Seoul. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL5xbM4dncs&t=133.5s)]
