# Why is Justin Trudeau resigning as Canada's prime minister?
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc)
*  Justin Trudeau's nine years as Canadian prime minister is coming to an end. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=0.0s)]
*  Today he announced he will step down as the leader of the governing Liberal Party. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=5.76s)]
*  JUSTIN TRUDEAU, Canadian Prime Minister The fact is, despite best efforts to work [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=10.84s)]
*  through it, Parliament has been paralyzed for months after what has been the longest [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=15.0s)]
*  session of a minority parliament in Canadian history. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=22.36s)]
*  This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=26.799999999999997s)]
*  me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  The embattled prime minister went on to say Canada's parliament will be suspended until [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=40.16s)]
*  March 24 while a new leader of his party is chosen. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=45.36s)]
*  I want to bring in Mackenzie Gray. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  He is a national reporter for Canada's Global News. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=51.2s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=53.72s)]
*  Take us behind the scenes here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=56.28s)]
*  Prime Minister Trudeau has been this major force on the Canadian political scene, the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=58.24s)]
*  global political scene, for a long time, many, many years now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=62.16s)]
*  What led inside his own party to this ouster? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=67.64s)]
*  MACKENZIE GRAY, Canadian Prime Minister Really, it's been bad polling numbers. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=70.64s)]
*  For about a year now, Mr. Trudeau has been behind the Conservative Party, and those numbers [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=74.72s)]
*  have grown substantially. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=78.68s)]
*  In the past few months, the Liberals projected to in the next election, which will take place [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=80.18s)]
*  in 2025, potentially lose by between 20 and 25 points, get absolutely wiped out in the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=84.28s)]
*  House of Commons, Canadian parliament, and potentially be not the first party, not the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=89.56s)]
*  second party, not the third party, the fourth party in parliament. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=93.48s)]
*  So there was really a mutiny from Liberal members of parliament to tell Justin Trudeau [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=96.44s)]
*  he needed to quit. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=100.2s)]
*  And Mr. Trudeau quit today in the face of potentially more resignations from cabinet. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=101.56s)]
*  A few weeks ago, he lost his deputy prime minister and finance minister, who quit just [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=105.6s)]
*  hours before a big fall economic statement, kind of like a budget here in Canada. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=109.76s)]
*  That was a major blow to Trudeau, who had not talked to Canadians since the resignation [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=113.72s)]
*  of Christian Freeland, his former deputy prime minister, until today, when he announced that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=117.8s)]
*  he intends to leave after the Liberal Party announces a new leader, likely sometime in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=121.6s)]
*  March. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=125.8s)]
*  As you noted, Trudeau has faced tough poll numbers for a long time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=126.8s)]
*  He's also faced scrutiny over his handling of the relationship with the United States. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=132.16s)]
*  He went down to Mar-a-Lago to see president-elect Donald Trump, and Trump has taunted him ever [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=136.8s)]
*  since, saying that Trudeau should become the governor of Canada and Canada should consider [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  being annexed by the United States. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=147.24s)]
*  How did that Trump factor play into how Liberal Party members saw the prime minister and his [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=149.56s)]
*  position? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=154.36s)]
*  It certainly didn't help the situation. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  These 51st state tweets, all of these things that Donald Trump has been talking about, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=159.0s)]
*  has kind of underscored the line that many in the Conservative Party here in Canada, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=163.16s)]
*  the official opposition, have been saying needs to have, needs for an election to happen [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  because Mr. Trudeau is at the end of his mandate here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=171.82s)]
*  There is a scheduled election to happen in 2025. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=174.26s)]
*  And with Mr. Trudeau at the end and having low polling numbers, many analysts have been [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=177.5s)]
*  focusing on the fact that maybe Donald Trump's looking right past Justin Trudeau and focusing [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=180.98s)]
*  on Pierre Polyab, who's the Conservative leader, someone that Elon Musk has been tweeting about, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=185.62s)]
*  someone that Joe Rogan is talking about, someone that in Conservative American circles has [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=189.7s)]
*  been starting to gain some traction. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=193.4s)]
*  So Trump's tweets, Trump's taunts really did not help Mr. Trudeau, who was already in a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=195.26s)]
*  weak position. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  And there was a lot of concern and angst here in Canada about the potential for these 25% [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  tariffs to be levied on Canadian goods going to the U.S. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=204.73999999999998s)]
*  Estimates up here would see a potential 5% GDP cut in the Canadian economy, a potential [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=207.66s)]
*  disaster for Canada. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=212.77999999999997s)]
*  And briefly, for those Americans who are not paying close attention to Canadian politics, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=215.1s)]
*  give us a glimpse inside the Conservative Party in Canada, which seems rather excited [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=220.42s)]
*  in recent days about their chances in the next Canadian election and about their leader. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=225.94s)]
*  Yeah, Pierre Polyab is the leader of the Conservative Party. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=230.94s)]
*  As I mentioned, there's been many Americans who've been really pushing it forward, trying [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=235.3s)]
*  to look past Trudeau, pushing Mr. Polyab forward. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  And if the polls hold up now, he basically won a super majority in the House of Commons [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=241.3s)]
*  here in Canada. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=245.5s)]
*  He could have been one of the biggest electoral victories in Canadian history. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=246.5s)]
*  But they have really been running on a platform that's very anti-Trudeau, saying that Mr. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  Trudeau has broken everything. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=253.3s)]
*  So today is a bit of a setback for them. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=254.78s)]
*  They were certainly hoping to run against Mr. Trudeau in the next election. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=256.5s)]
*  And that next election is likely to happen relatively soon, probably sometime in April. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=259.94s)]
*  So there's likely a new prime minister coming in then. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=264.53999999999996s)]
*  And of course, Canada is hosting the G7 this year. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=266.94s)]
*  So it will be a big question if Donald Trump comes up to meet the likely new prime minister [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=269.58s)]
*  at that point in time in Pierre Polyab and the Conservative Party. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=273.78s)]
*  A lot to happen in Canadian politics between now and then, if that possibility ever emerges. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=277.06s)]
*  Mackenzie Gray, thanks for stopping by. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=281.78s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=283.41999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Ukmmo-3Fc&t=284.7s)]
