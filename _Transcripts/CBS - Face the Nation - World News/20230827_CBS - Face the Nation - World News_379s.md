Fiona Hill, the former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council during the Trump administration, tells "Face the Nation" the plane crash was "so dramatic"  that "one has to ask whether this was done for the demonstrative effect of it."

# Russia expert Fiona Hill says Prigozhin's death in a plane crash is "par for the course"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw)
*  Russia's investigative committee confirmed today that the remains of Wagner leader Yevgeny [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=0.0s)]
*  Purgosian have been positively identified, along with the nine others who died in a plane [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=5.0s)]
*  crash last week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=11.52s)]
*  We're joined by Fiona Hill, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former White [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=13.36s)]
*  House Russia expert. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=18.32s)]
*  Good morning, Fiona. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=20.2s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=21.2s)]
*  So Russian President Vladimir Putin claims he had nothing to do with this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=23.2s)]
*  Is there anyone in the diplomatic community who believes that? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=27.88s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  And look, I think what we can certainly say is he didn't order it not to happen because [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=32.76s)]
*  there are plenty of people who were painting a target on Purgosian's back. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=37.44s)]
*  The system itself expected him to be taken out of the picture in some fashion. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=41.5s)]
*  I guess it was a question about what the method would be. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=46.76s)]
*  And in fact, I think over the last two months has been more shock, not just internationally, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  but also domestically based on the source reporting that the fact that nothing had [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=54.24s)]
*  happened to Purgosian and that he was allowed to walk around as if he hadn't indeed perpetrated [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=58.96s)]
*  a putsch exactly two months ago. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=63.940000000000005s)]
*  You know, usually Putin's enemies tend to get poisoned or pushed out windows or shot. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=66.16s)]
*  Why go to the trouble of bombing an airplane? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=74.34s)]
*  Well, we don't know exactly how the aircraft was brought down yet, but I guess we'll find [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  out more as things go along. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=82.72000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure again that the Russian government, the Kremlin will accuse all kinds of other [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=84.28s)]
*  people about carrying out this act if it seemed to be the result of an explosive device, you [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  know, for example. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  But it's so dramatic. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=94.98s)]
*  It's so spectacular that, of course, one has to ask whether this was done for the demonstrative [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=97.48s)]
*  effect of it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  And we have had some mysterious plane crashes in the past taking down Russian leaders. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  There was a very famous general, Alexander Lebed, for example, who died in a helicopter [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=110.56s)]
*  crash. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  So it's not something that is unheard of. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  In other settings as well, of course, we've had Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, where there [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=119.68s)]
*  have been the loss of key people in plane crashes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=124.44000000000001s)]
*  So I think this is par for the course, unfortunately. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=129.76s)]
*  And there is some symmetry, isn't there, to Purgosian's dash to Moscow in that aborted [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=132.44s)]
*  mutiny when the Wagner group brought down several Russian aircraft? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=138.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  So this is also part of that idea of he who lives by the sword dies by the sword and eye [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  for an eye. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=147.96s)]
*  The vengeance factor, it's baked into the system. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=148.96s)]
*  There was a lot of clamor from the uniformed military and especially the Air Force for [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=151.76s)]
*  some kind of retribution for this, whether it was in a legal form. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=155.28s)]
*  But look, he took down a proportional number of people in a Russian military aircraft, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=159.26s)]
*  as you've just said here. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=165.0s)]
*  So again, there is a symmetry and a symbolism in all of this that is inescapable in the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=166.3s)]
*  Russian domestic context, as well as for the rest of us watching it from the outside. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=172.10000000000002s)]
*  The Wagner group has been so pivotal for the Russian military in the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=176.26000000000002s)]
*  Now there are reports that the Russian government is requiring Wagner fighters to sign loyalty [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  oaths. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=188.74s)]
*  What is this going to mean, the death of Yevgeny Purgosian? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  What will it mean for the war in Ukraine? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=194.18s)]
*  Well, I don't think it'll actually mean anything significant for the war in Ukraine in terms [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=196.02s)]
*  of the military campaign itself. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=200.28s)]
*  We were already seeing that Wagner was being pulled out, it was pulling out after the actions [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=203.06s)]
*  in Bakhmut, where they were in the thick of the fighting there in that city that, of course, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=208.5s)]
*  you know, was so much of the focus of the carnage of the war over the last several months. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  But it was already a precipitating factor in all of this series of events over the last [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=219.34s)]
*  two months, the idea that the Wagner group were going to be dismantled and reincorporated [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=223.9s)]
*  or incorporated for the first time rather into the Russian military. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=229.18s)]
*  And that was one of the factors that Purgosian himself was citing as a reason for him making [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  his march on Moscow. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=239.1s)]
*  He didn't want to have his guys put under the command of the central Russian military. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=240.28s)]
*  So I think, you know, what we can see from all of this is that Wagner was pretty crucial [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=245.8s)]
*  for these early stages, this first couple of parts of the campaign in Ukraine. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=250.18s)]
*  And now the Russian government and Putin wants to have more centralized control. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  He gave Wagner a long leash and Purgosian clearly took that leash far too far. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=261.18s)]
*  You know, you're such a close study of Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=265.7s)]
*  You've sat across the table from him. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=269.02s)]
*  How should we think about his power in Russia now after this likely assassination? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=270.86s)]
*  There was a period of time after Purgosian made that dash to Moscow where it seemed like [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=279.26s)]
*  elites, commentators in Russia felt more comfortable speaking out against Putin, against the war. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=285.74s)]
*  He appeared to be weak. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  How does his standing look to you now? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=294.7s)]
*  Well, not only were other commentators speaking up, but Purgosian himself said this war was [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=297.26s)]
*  a mistake, but it was basically he was acting because he wanted to make sure that the war [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=301.5s)]
*  was won. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=305.7s)]
*  And that was kind of part of the theme of his revolt. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=306.74s)]
*  Now other commentators, as you rightly said, including some senior generals have been bashed, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=311.46s)]
*  literally bashed back and put out of the picture for saying the same kinds of things. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=317.42s)]
*  What Putin is saying with this assassination, whether he actually carried out or not, the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=322.34s)]
*  message is going to be very clearly transmitted to everybody. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=327.38s)]
*  No speaking out now, buckle down, everyone getting behind this campaign in Ukraine. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=332.42s)]
*  That's why I say I don't think it's really going to change the way that the Russians [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=338.18s)]
*  are approaching this. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  And there is no room whatsoever for disloyalty. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=342.38s)]
*  One of the things that Putin said that was very notable when the mutiny, the putsch was [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=345.34000000000003s)]
*  happening two months ago, is that the traitors who carried this out will have an inevitable [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=350.02000000000004s)]
*  punishment. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=354.22s)]
*  We've seen an inevitable death as a result of this that everyone was foretold. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=355.22s)]
*  I mean, we've all been expecting something like this for the last two months. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=359.42s)]
*  The message to the whole system is don't try anything and even don't criticize, I would [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=363.02000000000004s)]
*  say, at this particular point, because we've seen so much action against people who have [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  been speaking out. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=371.74s)]
*  And Purgosian may not be the last to be targeted. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=373.06s)]
*  Fiona Hill, Russia expert, thank you so much for being here today. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1C9z36nnw&t=375.74s)]
