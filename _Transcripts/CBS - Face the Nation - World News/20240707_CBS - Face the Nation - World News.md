# Face the Nation: Stoltenberg, Panels
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE)
*  Leaders of America's closest European allies will be coming to Washington this week for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=0.0s)]
*  the annual NATO summit. NATO Secretary General Jan Sultenberg is here. Good morning, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=4.72s)]
*  Secretary General. Great to have you here at the table. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Let me read you a headline from The Wall Street Journal. Quote, the world saw President [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=12.0s)]
*  Biden deteriorating. Democrats ignored warnings. European leaders and officials expressed [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=16.04s)]
*  worries about his focus and stamina. You're meeting with NATO leaders this week in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=20.8s)]
*  Washington. You're close with President Biden and many other NATO leaders. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=24.88s)]
*  What's your real take on the private assessment of the president of the United States among [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=29.04s)]
*  NATO leaders? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=33.8s)]
*  I'm absolutely confident that when all NATO leaders convene here this week it will be a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=36.28s)]
*  great summit. We will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the most successful alliance in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=40.44s)]
*  history. And I just met President Biden in the Oval Office a couple of weeks ago and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=45.4s)]
*  that was a good and productive meeting where we prepared all the important decisions we [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=50.6s)]
*  made here on defense, on support for Ukraine, and not least on burnishing that European [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=54.76s)]
*  allies are now really stepping up and spending record amount of money on defense, and of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=60.28s)]
*  course also on China and how we need to work together. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=65.0s)]
*  So this is a substance of the summit and of course these decisions would not have been [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=68.2s)]
*  possible to make without a strong U.S. leadership. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=73.08s)]
*  There's no question the substance is what matters. We just heard from Senator Lindsey [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=75.8s)]
*  Graham of South Carolina, a Republican who's close to the Republican nominee. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=79.16s)]
*  He's saying he has concerns that world leaders don't trust President Biden to be in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=83.24s)]
*  command of the job. You speak privately with these people. What's the truth here? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=87.72s)]
*  Are there concerns or not among NATO leaders? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  If I started to comment on issues like that then suddenly NATO, I will be part of domestic [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=96.2s)]
*  debate. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=101.4s)]
*  It would be easy to say no or yes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=102.12s)]
*  But I think it's important for NATO to stay out of that kind of domestic discussions. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  They are of course important in the United States but NATO should not be part of it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  What matters for NATO is the decisions what you do together. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=112.52s)]
*  And just for instance on defense spending which has been a big issue for the United [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=116.28s)]
*  States for many years under different presidents. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=121.24s)]
*  When we made the pledge 10 years ago to increase defense spending only three allies spent 2% [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=125.24s)]
*  of GDP on defense. This year it's 23 allies and increase just this year 18% across Europe [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=130.44s)]
*  and Canada. So record high investments by European allies. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=137.4s)]
*  I understand you want to focus on that. But you've just been with President Biden as you [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=140.6s)]
*  said in the Oval Office. What's your personal assessment? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=144.52s)]
*  Is he someone you can work with in an effective way on the policy issues? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=147.4s)]
*  We had a good, we had a productive meeting and of course there is no way to make these [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=151.24s)]
*  big decisions on how to further strengthen NATO, enlarge NATO, new members without having a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=155.72s)]
*  strong U.S. leadership. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=162.36s)]
*  Why such a long timeline to bring in Ukraine? You've talked about a 10-year window. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=164.52s)]
*  Why is it 10 years versus maybe one or two or three years since they're facing war? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=168.36s)]
*  Well, no one has said exactly 10 years. But it's obvious that it is a very serious issue [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=173.0s)]
*  to bring in Ukraine because Ukraine is now a country at war. Ukraine has been attacked [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=178.44000000000003s)]
*  by Russia. So the most important thing we should do is to step up our support to Ukraine to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  ensure that Ukraine prevails. That's a precondition for any future membership for Ukraine. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=191.16000000000003s)]
*  Stay with us. We'll have more questions for the secretary general soon. Please stay with us. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=196.44000000000003s)]
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with the NATO secretary general. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  Secretary General Soltenberg, thanks for sticking around with us. What are the specific [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=213.56s)]
*  deliverables of this NATO summit, especially when it comes to whether there could be [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  training and an alliance plan for NATO troops with Ukraine? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=221.56s)]
*  Well, we make important decisions on stepping up our support to Ukraine. NATO will take over the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=225.56s)]
*  provision and the coordination of security assistance to Ukraine and also training. We will [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=231.48s)]
*  have a command established in Germany and with logistical hubs in the eastern part of the alliance [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=238.84s)]
*  to help to get over the equipment, the ammunition and also the training for Ukrainian forces. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=245.56s)]
*  This is a big and important deliverable from the summit to ensure a more robust framework for our [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=251.16s)]
*  support to Ukraine. So the NATO leaders are in Washington focusing on that deliverable, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=256.2s)]
*  but the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Friday was just in Moscow meeting with Vladimir [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=260.2s)]
*  Putin. Would you discourage him to continue those talks and should he let NATO handle this at this [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=264.92s)]
*  point? Prime Minister Orban, he made it clear when he came to Moscow that he didn't go there on [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=271.0s)]
*  behalf of NATO, different NATO allies interact with Moscow in different ways. What matters for [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=277.48s)]
*  me is that all allies have agreed that we need to do more for Ukraine, both with this new training [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=284.76s)]
*  and assistance that NATO will provide to Ukraine, but also with the long-term pledge. And I also [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=292.92s)]
*  expect that by the summit and starts next week, allies will make new announcements on more air [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  defence and more ammunition. So yes, Hungary have, also Prime Minister Orban has been in Moscow, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=304.2s)]
*  but that doesn't change the common decisions you have made as NATO. Does it affect NATO in any way [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=311.24s)]
*  to have Orban doing his own thing? No, because the reality is that we are able to make decisions [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=316.52s)]
*  on how we are going to step up our support to Ukraine, because we all want peace. The thing is [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=323.56s)]
*  that the easiest way to end the war is to lose the war, but that's not peace, that's occupation. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=330.84s)]
*  So therefore we need a lasting just peace and the only way to get there is to convince President [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=338.2s)]
*  Putin that he will not win on the battlefield. He has to sit down and accept a solution where [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=344.12s)]
*  Ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent nation in Europe and the only way to convince Putin that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=348.91999999999996s)]
*  he will not win on the battlefield is to provide military support to Ukraine. So a negotiated [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=353.4s)]
*  solution that is lasting for Ukraine requires military support to Ukraine. It's notable, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=358.04s)]
*  Secretary General, that Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea will be joining this summit. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  Is this about trying to come up with a strategy for China as China works with Russia on its war [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=370.44s)]
*  with Ukraine? Yes, very much so because the war in Ukraine demonstrates how closely aligned Russia [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=375.64000000000004s)]
*  and China and North Korea and Iran are. China is the main enabler of Russia's war aggression against [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=381.88s)]
*  Ukraine. President Xi and President Putin, they all want NATO, the United States, to fail in Ukraine [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=389.88s)]
*  and if Putin wins in Ukraine, it will not only embolden President Putin, also embolden President Xi. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=396.28s)]
*  As the Japanese Prime Minister said, what happens in Ukraine today can happen in Asia tomorrow. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=402.6s)]
*  So it demonstrates that NATO is important for the United States also in terms of addressing China. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=409.64s)]
*  The United States is big, but in NATO you have something that no other big power has and that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=414.76s)]
*  is more than 30 friends and allies. The United States is 25 percent of the world's GDP together [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=419.71999999999997s)]
*  with NATO allies, who are twice as much, 50 percent of the world's economic and military might. So the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=426.84s)]
*  United States is stronger also in addressing China together with NATO. And last thing here quickly, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=432.76s)]
*  Secretary General, last week the American military's European command raised the threat level [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=437.72s)]
*  at bases on the continent to what's called Charlie. That's the second highest of five [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=442.12s)]
*  threat levels. Do you share as the leader of NATO this heightened concern about security in Europe? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=447.08000000000004s)]
*  Yes, we always have to be vigilant and aware of the threat of terrorist actions and therefore it is [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=454.36s)]
*  important that the U.S. command is vigilant and take the decisions on alert levels which they [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=463.24s)]
*  deem necessary. What's driving it? Is it Gaza, Ukraine, the Olympics? It is a combination. It's [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=469.64000000000004s)]
*  always a bit dangerous or difficult to go into the details of intelligence, but NATO, the U.S., [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=475.16s)]
*  we have to be aware of the constant threat of new terrorist attacks and that's exactly what we are [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=481.32000000000005s)]
*  by also exchanging more intelligence and working together. Secretary General Stoltenberg, thanks [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=485.88s)]
*  for being here. We appreciate it and we'll be right back. We're back with Democratic [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=490.2s)]
*  strategist and CBS News contributors Ashley Etienne and Joel Payne. So glad to have you both [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=497.56s)]
*  here on Sunday morning. Let's begin with you, Ashley. You're a former top aide to Vice President [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=502.59999999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris. She is part of all of these discussions among Democrats behind the scenes. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=508.03999999999996s)]
*  Is she getting ready to possibly be the nominee or is she all in with President Biden? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=513.4s)]
*  What's your read talking to your friends in the party and at the White House? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=517.72s)]
*  Well, she said two things and one is she said she's all in with Joe Biden and that [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=520.9200000000001s)]
*  they can win this next race in November, but she's also said that she's ready and I believe [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=525.8000000000001s)]
*  that she is. I mean, she's been putting in the work. She's hit 20 states, 60 communities. She's [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=531.0s)]
*  been leading the effort on the issues that we know we're going to move that one to two percent [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=537.4s)]
*  from reproductive rights to climate change to democracy in the state of democracy. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=542.04s)]
*  So she's been actually out there doing the work and it's showing dividends in the actual polls. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=548.76s)]
*  She's polling in some cases even better than Joe Biden among those key constituencies. That'll [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  make the difference in the election from people of color to women to independent voters. But here's [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=557.8s)]
*  my advice. I think they need to elevate her more at the national level. I would have loved to have [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  seen her do a speech over the July 4th weekend about the Supreme Court's recent decision and [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=567.32s)]
*  what's on the line here. It's democracy versus a dictatorship. She can make that argument better [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=574.0400000000001s)]
*  than anyone else can as a former prosecutor, as a child of immigrants. She's got the skills, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=579.4000000000001s)]
*  the talent. She's ready to go, but as it stands right now, she's in with Joe Biden. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=585.72s)]
*  So Ashley is someone who knows the vice president so well, worked with the vice president. Joel, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=590.12s)]
*  you talked to Democrats, you worked on Capitol Hill, you worked for presidential campaigns. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=594.92s)]
*  What is their assessment of Vice President Harris and of President Biden at this moment? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=599.16s)]
*  Well look, I mean, I think Democrats writ large overall feel really good about the Biden-Harris [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=603.4799999999999s)]
*  ticket. I think what we're in the midst of right now is giving the president and his team some space [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=608.1999999999999s)]
*  to kind of deal with the fallout from the debate last week. It's interesting, there were a couple [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=613.0s)]
*  of interventions this week. There was a call with governors. There were events in Wisconsin and North [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=616.68s)]
*  Carolina. There were a lot of interventions that I think the president and his team wanted to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=621.48s)]
*  demonstrate that there's a path forward. And I think that folks are giving him that space. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=626.28s)]
*  It seems like the negative momentum was slowed. I still think more work needs to be done to calm [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=629.8000000000001s)]
*  the waters. I talked to a source on Capitol Hill, a senior Democrat who told me consensus right now [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=634.9200000000001s)]
*  among Hill Democrats is that there are still more questions to be answered than those that have been [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=640.84s)]
*  answered. And I think that's what the president and his team are dealing with going into a really busy [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=645.4s)]
*  week. Can I just add something there? I mean, you know, I love the my party, but we need to take a [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=648.84s)]
*  deep breath. You know, Joe Biden had the worst night of his political career last week, and still [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=653.72s)]
*  Donald Trump made no gains. If you look at the polls, the polls are demonstrating that Biden made [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=659.64s)]
*  close the gap among independent voters, that the push polls show that that one to two percent were [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=665.72s)]
*  turned off by Donald Trump on his lies from his record all the way to January 6th. The other thing [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=672.9200000000001s)]
*  is that the polls show that Joe Biden is not a drag on the lower ballot, the ballot below him. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=678.52s)]
*  So I mean, the reality is, is Biden is in a strong position. We need to rally around the president. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=685.0s)]
*  But what the president has to do is convince those members of Congress, the donor class, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=691.16s)]
*  as well as the grassroots, that it's worth taking this risk on him. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=695.88s)]
*  COSTA Help us understand, you're two of the top Democratic strategists in this country. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=699.0s)]
*  You're making the case for President Biden and for why Democrats should give him time to reassure [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=703.96s)]
*  people, to maybe write his campaign. But what's the truth of what's happening behind the scenes? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=710.2s)]
*  Are there moves and discussions happening against President Biden to nudge him away, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=715.8s)]
*  even push him off the ticket? Or is that just beltway chatter? What's the real story? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=721.0s)]
*  BALLERIN Well, Democrats have never been, had a reputation as the most confident bunch, even in [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=725.16s)]
*  good times. And I think particularly in a difficult time where you had a really tough show for Joe [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=728.6s)]
*  Biden, I think Democrats are just taking some time to figure out, hey, is this still the best path [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=734.84s)]
*  forward? I think they want to give the president the space to do that. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=739.08s)]
*  COSTA Is there a divide between what Democratic voters are saying and what Democratic consultants [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=741.08s)]
*  are saying? BALLERIN That's what I was just going to add that, Bob. I think what we're seeing now [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=745.16s)]
*  in the Biden campaign, I think, is trying to seize on this, is an emerging fissure between [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=747.64s)]
*  kind of elites, folks inside the beltway, what they think, which I think by and large we're seeing [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=751.5600000000001s)]
*  a lot of concern about Joe Biden. With voters, it's unclear if it's there yet. I talked to [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=756.44s)]
*  an elected official in a battleground state who told me with older African-American voters that [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=761.88s)]
*  they didn't feel like that the debate was going to have that much of an impact. But with younger [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=766.36s)]
*  voters, those that you need to turn out, that's where they were concerned about Biden's [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=770.04s)]
*  performance maybe being a drag. COSTA Actually, who has influence right now? You've worked with [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=773.64s)]
*  speaker, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the highest level. You've worked with Vice President [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=777.96s)]
*  Harris inside the Biden White House. Is it First Lady Jill Biden and Hunter Biden? Is it former [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=782.12s)]
*  Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer? Who are the real players right now? Whether he stays as he [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=787.08s)]
*  continues to insist he will or goes, who are the players who have actual political capital at this [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=791.88s)]
*  time? BALLERIN Well, a couple things I can say. One, this next week is going to be critical for [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=798.12s)]
*  President Biden. He, you know, the smart thing is that his campaign and the White House have set up [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=801.5600000000001s)]
*  opportunities for him to convince the American people that he's prepared, ready and competent [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=807.32s)]
*  to handle this job. But he needs to convince that political class, the donor class and the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=812.2s)]
*  grassroots class of that fact. The other thing is, you know, the members of Congress are going to be [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=818.2s)]
*  back on the Hill next week and there's going to be reporters that are going to be cornering them, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=822.84s)]
*  asking them, do they support the president? Do they not? Then there's going to be trackers and [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=826.6s)]
*  that's going to mount some pressure. So this is going to be the first test for Congressman Jeffries, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=830.44s)]
*  leader Jeffries, as well as Schumer. Can they hold the line? Defections is not what Biden needs [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=835.4s)]
*  right now. So they've got to hold the line for him. The other thing I would say is we need to, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=841.88s)]
*  I would caution reporters to not obsess about the number of defections. If there are more, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=847.4s)]
*  it's the who, to your point. Who brings someone with them? If someone like Speaker Pelosi or [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=852.52s)]
*  someone in leadership defects, that's going to be a problem. If it is someone who leads a big caucus, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=858.1999999999999s)]
*  like the progressive caucus, or even more importantly, I would say these frontline members. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=863.24s)]
*  If you see more of them start to defect, that's going to be a problem. And you've worked for the [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=867.5600000000001s)]
*  Senate leadership. Who are you watching, Joel? Well, I think it's notable that some of the folks [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=872.04s)]
*  that we've seen speak out, whether it's the Mark Warner and Angie Craig, these are folks who are [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=876.36s)]
*  from Joe Biden's lane. And I think that's what's concerning. Typically, the way you fix a problem [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=879.96s)]
*  with that President Biden is dealing with right now is more. You fled the zone with more of him, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=886.12s)]
*  more public events, more national interviews. And I think by and large, the Democrats I talked to, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=890.52s)]
*  they want to see more of the president. In any scenario, that is the only way out is more of [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=895.0s)]
*  the president exposing Joe Biden, rather Donald Trump, and showing that Joe Biden can run the [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=900.04s)]
*  vigorous campaign that I think Democrats all want him to. We're going to have to leave it there. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=905.24s)]
*  That it's only Biden that can temper anxiety. I think he should go to the Hill next week, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=908.84s)]
*  meet with the caucus. I think the VP should go to the Senate and meet with those members [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=912.76s)]
*  and see where we get. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=917.32s)]
*  COSTA We'll see if they take your advice. Many Democrats often do. So great to have both of you [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=918.28s)]
*  here at the table. Appreciate your insights as ever. And we'll be back in a moment. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=922.92s)]
*  We're back with more analysis. Nancy Cordes is our chief White House correspondent. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=930.36s)]
*  Molly Ball is the senior political correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. And Carl Hulse is [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=935.32s)]
*  The New York Times' chief Washington correspondent. Great to have all of you here. Top reporters, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=940.04s)]
*  notebooks ready, reporting ready. Let's begin with Capitol Hill. We heard from Senator Sanders. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=945.72s)]
*  We heard from Senator Graham. The big story this week is Senator Mark Warner, others in the Senate [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=951.0s)]
*  Democratic Conference may be meeting, as reported, to talk about President Biden's future. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=956.52s)]
*  Is there an effort afoot? Nancy, let's begin with you. You not only covered the Biden White House, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=962.52s)]
*  but you covered Capitol Hill for years and still have great sources there. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=966.28s)]
*  NANCY CORDES There's definitely an effort afoot. It's happening in the House. It's happening in [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=969.3199999999999s)]
*  the Senate. The White House feels like it weathered the storm for a week. But things, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=973.4s)]
*  as you know, get much different now that members are coming back to Washington after the July 4th [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=977.3199999999999s)]
*  break. Anytime they're all in one place together, they talk, they meet, they feed off of each other. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=983.16s)]
*  Fear is contagious. Concern is contagious. And up until now, you've been hearing rumors of these [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=989.64s)]
*  letters that exist that are being compiled that maybe have 25 members who are ready to sign on. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=995.24s)]
*  That really doesn't mean anything until they do it. They were hoping that just the talk would [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1002.2s)]
*  kind of put pressure on the White House. The White House said, you know, we're going to call your [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1007.4000000000001s)]
*  bluff. We don't believe you. But now that they're back and they feel that they may need to take this [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1011.96s)]
*  to the next level, we could see this blossom. COSTA And Carl, you cover the Senate so closely. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1016.44s)]
*  Look, senators talk all the time to each other. They never stop talking to each other. They never [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1022.44s)]
*  stop writing memos. It doesn't seem to be at this moment a Goldwater to Nixon moment, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1026.68s)]
*  it's time to leave. What's your assessment on your reporting of where this actually stands [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1032.8400000000001s)]
*  among Senate Democrats? CARL HULSE, The Washington Post, The Washington Post. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1037.3200000000002s)]
*  I think they're trying to figure out what to do. I do know that Mark Warner, from the moment the [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1038.44s)]
*  debate started, was very concerned, texting his colleagues saying, what are we going to do about [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1042.44s)]
*  this? So I think he was trying to gather them to say, what, how do we approach this? You know, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1047.64s)]
*  not like, hey, who are the three people who are going to march down to the Oval with me? But, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1053.72s)]
*  like, where do we go from here? They're worried. They're trying to hold on. The House, you know, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1058.28s)]
*  the Senate's being senatorial, they're being sort of more deliberate. Chuck Schumer has been very [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1062.52s)]
*  low-profile. The House, things are different. The House Democrats thought they were in great [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1067.08s)]
*  position to win the majority. The Republicans have had two horrible years of chaos, inability to [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1072.68s)]
*  govern. Now, all of a sudden, the House Democrats see this Biden situation consuming everything, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1078.6s)]
*  and they're worried that they're going to miss their chance. I think the people to watch, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1084.84s)]
*  in some ways, are the House, but that Biden is a Senate person. So what the Senate ends up doing [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1089.7199999999998s)]
*  and how they approach it, I think, is going to be very important with the president himself. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1097.56s)]
*  COSTA And, Molly, you literally wrote the book on former Speaker Pelosi, a terrific biography [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1101.6399999999999s)]
*  of her. What's her role now, working with leader Jeffries, and to build off what [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1106.6s)]
*  Carl was saying about the House and the scene there? What are you hearing? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1111.0s)]
*  MOLLY BALL, The New York Times, The New York Times, New York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1114.36s)]
*  Well, and I've been speaking with many lawmakers who are, I think, as Nancy and Carl have both [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1114.4399999999998s)]
*  said, they're looking at each other and they're trying to figure out what everybody else is doing [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1119.56s)]
*  and trying to figure out how to move forward. I think there was a real change in tone over the [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1123.48s)]
*  course of this last week as they, as many Democrats, including elected Democrats, thought [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1128.04s)]
*  that the White House and campaign would immediately sort of jump on the situation and do something to [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1134.92s)]
*  fix it. Instead, what they saw were a White House and campaign that were largely sort of [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1139.0s)]
*  staying the course and keeping the president mostly in his sort of bunker. And that did not [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1142.68s)]
*  inspire confidence. The one interview being so short, being not particularly impressive, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1147.96s)]
*  and the president seeming not at all to have gotten the message about how concerned people are, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1154.44s)]
*  that did not inspire confidence either. I was texting with one lawmaker in a swing district who [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1160.44s)]
*  was watching the interview and saying, this is just sad. And so there is a sadness that a lot of [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1167.0s)]
*  people feel, but it's turning to anger because, as Carl said, their own political careers are on the [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1172.2s)]
*  line and they are terribly uncertain about where this is all going. And I think panic is not too [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1176.92s)]
*  strong a word. There's a feeling that something has to be done. Nobody knows exactly what it is, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1184.6000000000001s)]
*  but they all know that once they're all together in the Capitol, some of these efforts are going [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1189.8s)]
*  to start to take shape. There will be a lot of people chasing lawmakers this week. But what about [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1193.72s)]
*  inside the White House? President Biden elected to the Senate in 1972, comes back after failing in [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1196.9199999999998s)]
*  the 88 campaign, stumbles in 2008, gets to become VP. Inside the White House, is there panic or is [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1203.8799999999999s)]
*  there a sense of solidarity among family members and top aides? Well, for now, they are closing [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1211.32s)]
*  ranks around this president. The entire upper echelon is insisting that they can get through [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1215.88s)]
*  this, that he deserves another four years, that he is okay, that they are going to prove that they [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1221.8000000000002s)]
*  are adding more events to the schedule all the time. I was just told by a White House official [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1226.2800000000002s)]
*  this morning that they're looking at adding an event in Michigan to the schedule on Friday after [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1230.7600000000002s)]
*  the NATO conference. Obviously Michigan, a big battleground state, just today he's in Pennsylvania, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1236.1200000000001s)]
*  surrounded by the entire Pennsylvania delegation. He's there with the governor and the two senators [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1241.32s)]
*  and several lawmakers, the mayor of Philadelphia. The message that they're trying to send is, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1247.96s)]
*  hey, you're hearing all this frustration inside the Beltway, but we've still got a lot of support [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1253.08s)]
*  and the voters are behind us. They've been trying to make this case to me over the weekend that [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1259.08s)]
*  voters still want him to press on, that what they're hearing out on the campaign trail, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1264.4399999999998s)]
*  what they're hearing in talk radio, is that people want him to continue and they're going [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1268.92s)]
*  to continue to support him. In some ways, there's some validity to that. You played some voters at [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1273.16s)]
*  the top of the show who said they have concerns, but they're going to vote for him anyway because [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1277.96s)]
*  they don't like the alternative, which is Donald Trump. But the big concern for elected Democrats [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1283.96s)]
*  is what about independence? What about people who weren't sold on him yet and don't feel that same [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1288.68s)]
*  allegiance as Democratic voters do? And yes, there are only a half a dozen elected lawmakers [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1295.8s)]
*  right now who are calling on him to step aside, but there are far more than that who are inching [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1302.84s)]
*  right up to that line and saying he needs to make a decision, he needs to think about this more [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1308.84s)]
*  carefully. Let's talk about former President Donald Trump. The Supreme Court ruled this past [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1314.04s)]
*  week that there's presidential immunity in a sweeping way for official acts. Carl, your book [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1318.84s)]
*  Confirmation Bias about how conservatives have nudged the court to the right, how significant was [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1323.48s)]
*  that ruling, especially if you look at a possible Trump second term? It's super significant as [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1328.92s)]
*  when you interviewed Senator Graham, he didn't want to talk about that too much, obviously. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1333.72s)]
*  Huge decision, so much for no one is above the law. John Roberts, the chief justice, he's a real [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1338.2s)]
*  believer in executive power. I think besides the impact on Trump, what that's doing is you're going [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1345.24s)]
*  to see a lot more talk from Democrats about the importance of the Supreme Court. This election is [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1351.88s)]
*  about the Supreme Court. We need to change the direction of the Supreme Court, not only presidential [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1356.7600000000002s)]
*  immunity, but also a series of rulings against federal agency power. This is a long sought goal [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1361.3200000000002s)]
*  of the conservative legal movement, and they basically won. So I think the Supreme Court is [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1368.68s)]
*  going to be elevated this time on the Democratic side. You even hear House members talking about [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1374.6000000000001s)]
*  they're going to introduce some articles of impeachment, obviously not going anywhere, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1379.56s)]
*  but that's a brand new step in congressional politics. And Democrats keep talking about if [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1383.48s)]
*  Trump wins again, he's going to have the Heritage Foundation running policy. They have this so-called [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1388.6799999999998s)]
*  Project 2025. Do you see on the Trump side of things a real aggressive policy agenda in the [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1393.72s)]
*  waiting in the wings? Yes and no. I mean, it's been interesting to see over the past few days, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1400.44s)]
*  President Trump came out on social media and disavowed Project 2025, even though many people [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1406.12s)]
*  very close to him are involved with it. It is like any of these think-tang efforts, and Project 25 [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1412.28s)]
*  is only the latest iteration of something that the Heritage Foundation does every four years and has [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1418.28s)]
*  for many, many decades now. That being said, it's a series of recommendations, but I think it's taken [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1424.12s)]
*  very seriously because, number one, last time Trump came into office, he didn't have a lot of [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1431.64s)]
*  plans formulated, and so the effort is to give him something that he can implement immediately, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1437.24s)]
*  should he so choose. And number two, that there is going to be a much more focused effort if Trump is [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1442.68s)]
*  elected again because of the fact that eight years ago he was not very focused. So I think all of [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1449.64s)]
*  these plans are getting a lot of scrutiny for that reason. We know that the Republicans didn't even [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1455.8000000000002s)]
*  have a platform four years ago this year. They're going to have one, but we're hearing it may be [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1460.2s)]
*  quite vague. It's going to be formulated behind closed doors, but not to turn everything back to [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1465.0s)]
*  the situation with President Biden. But a lot of the angst that Democrats feel is that they look [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1470.2s)]
*  at the plans that the Republicans are formulating. They look at a Donald Trump who may be unfettered [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1476.04s)]
*  by the rule of law or by any kind of criminal prosecution, and that is what's driving their [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1482.04s)]
*  angst about the president because they would like to have someone on top of the ticket who can [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1489.0s)]
*  prosecute that argument consistently, who can make the stakes clear to the American people, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1493.96s)]
*  and they felt that he had the chance to do that in the debate and he blew it, and they wonder how [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1498.92s)]
*  much better might we be doing if we had someone on top of the ticket who was capable of really making [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1504.76s)]
*  that choice clear to people. And very quickly, any thoughts on VP, any latest reporting? Very quickly. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1510.84s)]
*  Well, you'd have to look at governors from from battleground states, right, that could help her [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1516.2s)]
*  sensibly, Kamala Harris, pick up votes in the presidential election. We're talking about Roy [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1521.64s)]
*  Cooper, possibly Andy Beshear, if it goes that way. For now, though, the Biden White House insists [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1527.32s)]
*  that's not happening. That's not happening. Carl, any quick thoughts? I do think that the one comment [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1532.76s)]
*  that the president made that he will be happy if he does well and still loses did not go over. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1540.6s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1547.6399999999999s)]
*  That's it for us today. Margaret will be back next week. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoAnofVzliE&t=1557.24s)]
