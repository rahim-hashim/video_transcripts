# Trump administration doubts Ukrainian NATO membership and return to old borders is possible
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0)
*  As we've been reporting, President Trump said Wednesday he will likely meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=0.0s)]
*  The president spoke with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky separately about immediate discussions to end the war between the two countries. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=6.0s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hexed laid out how the U.S. could go about achieving peace during a NATO meeting Wednesday in Brussels. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=14.0s)]
*  We will only end this devastating war and establish a durable peace by coupling allied strength with a realistic assessment of the battlefield. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=22.0s)]
*  We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=34.0s)]
*  But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=40.0s)]
*  For more, let's bring in CBS News Senior National Security Correspondent Charlie Dagata. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=50.0s)]
*  So Charlie, in addition to Secretary Hexed's comments on Ukraine's borders, he also said NATO membership for Ukraine is unrealistic. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=54.0s)]
*  President Trump agreed with this. So please take us back. What are pre-2014 borders for Ukraine and why does the administration think these things are unrealistic? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=62.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Lindsay, I think it was unambiguous would be the words that even the administration used said it was an unreleased objective, illusionary goal. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=72.0s)]
*  So to take you back to 2014, a lot of people, it's difficult to remember that this is when the conflict with Ukraine began. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=83.0s)]
*  Right. And back in 2014, Russian-backed separatists took over a large area of eastern Ukraine that includes like the Donbass region, Donetsk, Luhansk. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=92.0s)]
*  I was there at the time. That was a real war that was going on. And that is now occupied by Russian-backed separatists. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=102.0s)]
*  More importantly than that, I think, is Crimea. OK, so Crimea was taken over just after that sort of conflict. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=109.0s)]
*  It was taken over without a shot being fired, but it is now under Russian control. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=116.0s)]
*  Now, President Zelensky, Ukrainian President Zelensky, has said Crimea is not a bargaining chip. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=121.0s)]
*  You know, if anything, it was something that he would bargain for. But in in recent months, even before the election, President Zelensky has sort of rode that back. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=127.0s)]
*  So that is what we're talking about. We're talking about the 2014 boundaries. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=136.0s)]
*  Significantly, we're talking about Crimea, significantly we're talking about eastern Ukraine in the past when this conflict began a few years ago when Russia tried to take over all of Ukraine. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=143.0s)]
*  President Zelensky said that he would never give up, give over any of that territory, including pre 2014. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=156.0s)]
*  So this will ruffle some feathers in Kiev who believe that, well, that that is where we begin. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=162.0s)]
*  If the negotiations start from it's unrealistic to even try, then it's essentially capitulating that territory, including Crimea, for any negotiations going forward. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=168.0s)]
*  As we mentioned, President Trump spoke with Presidents Putin and Zelensky separately Wednesday. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=180.0s)]
*  And President Trump also says he may meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia soon. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=184.0s)]
*  What more can you tell us about this, how that would work and go and what stakes Saudi Arabia has? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=189.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, I wish I had more details to provide in terms of how that meeting is going to take place. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=194.0s)]
*  It came as something of a surprise. But yes, President Trump said that that meeting would take place in Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=200.0s)]
*  He also said that I would go to or President Trump, he said he would go to the to Russia and President Putin might visit the United States. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=206.0s)]
*  What I think is significant here is Dmitry Peskov, who is in charge essentially of the Kremlin, Kremlin spokesperson, said that the phone call that took place took place for about an hour and a half. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=216.0s)]
*  And they went over all kinds of territory, including most significantly, obviously, the conflict in Ukraine. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=227.0s)]
*  And yes, President Trump has spoken to President Zelensky as well. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=233.0s)]
*  But this is I mean, I don't know exactly the date, but it's been years since a U.S. presidential administration has contacted, let alone had that kind of in-depth conversation with President Putin and his administration. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=236.0s)]
*  So it's progress in a way because there's communication that's taking place. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=252.0s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, I'm not sure we're going to find out details. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=256.0s)]
*  Certainly we're digging for those details. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=259.0s)]
*  But what's significant here is the channel of communication and how long those conversations took. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=262.0s)]
*  We appreciate your reporting, Charlie Daggett. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=267.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=269.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkDUR10oUg0&t=270.0s)]
