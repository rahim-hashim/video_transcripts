# Suspected rocket attack injures U.S. troops at base in Iraq
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY)
*  We're also following breaking news from the Middle East tonight, where U.S. personnel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=0.0s)]
*  have been injured after a suspected rocket attack hit Al-Assad Air Base in Iraq. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  CBS News intelligence and national security reporter Olivia Gazes joins me now with more [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=9.32s)]
*  on this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Olivia, what do we know? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Sure, Jeff. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=16.12s)]
*  Well, the country and the world have been on high alert for an impending retaliatory [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=17.12s)]
*  strike from Iran and its proxies. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  And one of the scenarios that U.S. officials had been planning for was potential strikes [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=24.84s)]
*  on its interests in the region. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=29.38s)]
*  U.S. troops positioned in Iraq and Syria. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=31.18s)]
*  And tonight we are learning that that may in fact have happened. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=33.94s)]
*  A Pentagon spokesperson telling us that there was a suspected rocket attack on U.S. and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=37.14s)]
*  coalition forces at Al-Assad Air Base in Iraq, that the initial indications are that at least [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=42.22s)]
*  several U.S. personnel have been injured in that attack and that base personnel are still [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=48.22s)]
*  conducting a post-attack assessment. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=53.04s)]
*  We do not know where these rockets came from. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=55.58s)]
*  We do not know the severity of the injuries, nor how numerous they are. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=57.5s)]
*  But it is a troubling indication that the U.S. has not managed to stay out of direct [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=61.62s)]
*  engagement in this conflict, not just coming to Israel's defense, as we know U.S. officials [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=66.76s)]
*  have said that they will do, but to have to engage in counter-strikes now that its own [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=71.38s)]
*  interests may have been attacked. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=76.34s)]
*  We know that was the case when three U.S. service members lost their lives when an Iran-backed [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=78.86s)]
*  militia launched a drone attack on a U.S. base in Jordan. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=83.66s)]
*  That was in January of this year. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=88.32s)]
*  The U.S. did take retaliatory strikes in Iraq and Syria and response. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=89.7s)]
*  And it comes amid a furious diplomatic effort led by the White House and Secretary of State [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=94.66s)]
*  Antony Blinken over the last few days to forestall an escalation in tensions. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=99.5s)]
*  The secretary just recently spoke to the Iraqi prime minister about this possibility. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=104.74s)]
*  He worked the phones again today with Egyptian and Qatari counterparts, with Western diplomats, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=110.14s)]
*  with what he said today was a simple message. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=115.84s)]
*  All parties need to refrain from escalation and take steps to ease tensions. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=118.38s)]
*  It's not at all clear where we go from here, Jeff. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=123.02s)]
*  Yeah, I think the secretary of state called this a critical moment. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=125.22s)]
*  Olivia Gazes, thank you very much. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGk9AiwSAqY&t=128.34s)]
