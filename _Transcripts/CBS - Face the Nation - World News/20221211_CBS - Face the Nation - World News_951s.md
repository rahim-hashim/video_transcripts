# Jamie Dimon on Ukraine, China, homeownership and more
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg)
*  Jamie Dimon is the CEO of America's largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, and he's been a pillar [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=0.0s)]
*  of Wall Street for decades. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=5.08s)]
*  We caught up with him a few days ago in Baltimore, and among other things, we asked him about [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=7.34s)]
*  America's position in a tumultuous global economy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=12.24s)]
*  This moment we are in feels like a transition point, an inflection point, and I wonder how [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=16.72s)]
*  you think about where America is at this moment. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=22.6s)]
*  America is the most prosperous nation the world's ever seen. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=26.36s)]
*  Our basic principles of freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, are unbelievable. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=29.92s)]
*  The innovation is unparalleled anywhere around the world. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=35.300000000000004s)]
*  So start with that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=37.82s)]
*  It's an amazing position of strength. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=38.96s)]
*  The economy is going through a bunch of things, and we don't always really know whether you [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  have a mild recession or a hard recession, and if it happens, we're going to be fine. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=44.72s)]
*  I feel bad, terrible for people who lose jobs. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=48.6s)]
*  We want to keep it as short as possible. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  I do think you're right about a turning point, but that turning point is about geopolitics. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  It's about Ukraine, oil, Russia, war, migration, food, national security, China, trade, that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=56.76s)]
*  whole bucket of things. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=64.24s)]
*  And I'd put in that category quantitative tightening, which is basically reducing the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=65.72s)]
*  quid in the banking system of the world. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  That is actually, forget us for a second, that could be very difficult, high dollar [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=72.72s)]
*  going up, higher rates, and quantitative tightening on smaller countries around the world. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=77.64s)]
*  The World Bank and the IMF have been warning about this for a while. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  So I'm saying you've got to put that whole mix in what's happening in geopolitics. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=84.0s)]
*  Ukraine is a turning point where maybe all this illusion that we had that somehow the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=87.0s)]
*  world is at peace and everything will be fine, that should have been shattered. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  And therefore, we should be thinking about how can America do great in the next hundred [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=95.16s)]
*  years? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=99.16s)]
*  What policies should we have? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=100.16s)]
*  When I looked at your last shareholder letter, which I know you take a direct role in writing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=101.16s)]
*  I write every word. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, that was April. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  I get help, but I write every word. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  Everyone goes through a process in thinking through these things. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=112.88s)]
*  And when you ranked some of the things worrying you, Ukraine was right up there with all the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=116.4s)]
*  domestic issues. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=121.28s)]
*  That was right after the war started. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=122.28s)]
*  Now we're at a point where some would look and say, OK, it wasn't the worst case scenario [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=125.0s)]
*  in Europe in terms of severe recession. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=128.92s)]
*  They're finding ways to get oil and gas elsewhere. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=132.92s)]
*  Do you think in the same way now as you did then in terms of risk? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=136.3s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  I think even more so. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that's the security that you've had this war going on for nine months or whatever, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=142.48s)]
*  and that somehow it's OK. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=146.2s)]
*  Oil prices are one way up. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  Europe's going to a recession. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  Migration has been extraordinary. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  You haven't seen the full effect of food prices around the world. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=152.67999999999998s)]
*  If you go to Europe, they're taking this much more seriously than Americans are. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=155.72s)]
*  They're on the front line. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=160.44s)]
*  You have those missiles going to Poland. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=161.44s)]
*  You have basically nuclear blackmail. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it is as serious as you can get. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=164.6s)]
*  So we should all hope it goes away, that there's some kind of armistice or settlement that's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=167.0s)]
*  good for Ukraine, by the way. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=172.28s)]
*  The danger of this war is extraordinary, and it can go on for years. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  But this oil and gas thing, it looks like the Europeans will get through it this winter. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=177.96s)]
*  But this oil and gas problem is going to go on for years. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=182.74s)]
*  So if I was in the government or anywhere else, I'd say I have to prepare for getting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=185.3s)]
*  much worse. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=190.9s)]
*  I hope it doesn't, but I would definitely be preparing for it to get much worse. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  What does that look like to you in terms of what should be prepared for on the energy [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=195.4s)]
*  front? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=199.16s)]
*  On the energy front, we need secure, reliable, cheap oil and gas. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=200.16s)]
*  The problem, a lot of people think that oil and gas prices being high is good for CO2. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=203.16s)]
*  It's not. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=206.44s)]
*  So cheap, reliable. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=207.44s)]
*  You're looking at Germany. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=208.88s)]
*  I mean, the Europeans are terrified. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=209.88s)]
*  Their energy prices are two, three, four, five times ours, which is hurting consumers, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  which the governments have to do something about, and it's hurting businesses. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  And it's just started. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=222.4s)]
*  The pain and suffering can get a lot worse. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=224.0s)]
*  And it has the benefit, lower prices have the benefit of having more production. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=226.04s)]
*  They have the benefit of helping poor nations, lower income individuals, our allies who are [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=230.2s)]
*  desperate for more secure energy, and CO2. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=236.16s)]
*  Because quite predictably- [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=240.88s)]
*  Carbon emissions. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=241.88s)]
*  Carbon emissions. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=242.88s)]
*  Because quite predictably, carbon emissions are going up because nations rich and poor [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=243.88s)]
*  around the world are turning back on their coal plants. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=247.16s)]
*  They cannot afford expensive energy, and they can't afford no energy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=249.68s)]
*  So to me, to solve climate, we kind of need all the above. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  Permitting plants, gas is the best and cleanest way to reduce coal, which is the best way [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  to reduce CO2. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  So we are really thoughtful policy, cognitive policy will get us there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=264.44s)]
*  But it also is military policy, economic policy, including trade. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=267.36s)]
*  So when I say economic, I'm talking about trade is one thing, but economic is investment [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=271.6s)]
*  rights. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=275.72s)]
*  So anything that relates to national security will have to be re-changed. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=277.98s)]
*  President Biden has called it Putin's price spike, but he's also blamed price inflation [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=281.38s)]
*  on corporate profits. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=287.18s)]
*  And I know this irritates you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=288.74s)]
*  You've argued energy costs are not high because of price gouging, but because of the dramatic [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  decline in investments in energy, which results in reduced supply when demand goes up. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=295.62s)]
*  So if that's true, what is it going to take to increase lending to companies so they can [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=300.12s)]
*  make those investments? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=304.46000000000004s)]
*  This is a little more complicated now because part of it is the companies don't want to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=305.58s)]
*  do it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=308.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=309.5s)]
*  Well, part of it when people talk about excise profit tax, that's one. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=310.5s)]
*  They can't get permits done. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  They can't get leasing and stuff like that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=314.53999999999996s)]
*  And part of it is their investors are putting a lot of pressure on them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=316.18s)]
*  To go green. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=320.34s)]
*  To go green, but not to invest too much capital where you're not making a profit with oil [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=321.53999999999996s)]
*  at a high price. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=327.26s)]
*  Right now, it's come down considerably, mostly because China's slowed down and Europe's going [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=329.12s)]
*  to recession and that people think there might be a world recession. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=334.86s)]
*  So the future price of oil is going down. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=337.94s)]
*  Those things will reverse. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=340.08000000000004s)]
*  And this underinvestment in oil and gas, it will hurt you two or three years out. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=341.6s)]
*  That's quite predictable, but it's not today. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=344.66s)]
*  And so we have time. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm hoping the administration, they're looking at all these issues. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=348.42s)]
*  I've spoken to John Podesta, now runs the IRA Act, about what we can do to accelerate, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=351.94s)]
*  reduce CO2, but have better, cheaper, more secure energy, not just for us, but for particular [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=359.26s)]
*  allies around the world. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=364.54s)]
*  I think we need, I call it Marshall Plan for Energy. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=365.54s)]
*  And that's got to be all the above and all the people involved. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=368.26s)]
*  But the IRA you referred to, the Inflation Reduction Act, that's just a sliver of what [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=371.98s)]
*  you're imagining for a Marshall Plan. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=376.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=377.94s)]
*  And that is a huge, I mean, we're still studying every piece of it for renewables and EVs and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=378.94s)]
*  a lot of different things. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=384.66s)]
*  But it's not just that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=386.06s)]
*  It's the infrastructure we're building. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=387.74s)]
*  It's competition around the world. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=390.14s)]
*  It's access to rare earths. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=391.94s)]
*  I mean, when you dig into it, it's a really complex thing. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=393.38s)]
*  Those are the ingredients needed for electric vehicles that China has a monopoly on right now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=396.02s)]
*  They have a monopoly on production, not on where it is. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=400.7s)]
*  So we have rare earths in America. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=403.78s)]
*  Whether we can produce them here or not, because there are certain laws and requirements, that's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=405.41999999999996s)]
*  a different issue. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=409.18s)]
*  We need to build grids. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=410.18s)]
*  You know, we don't get permissions, permits to build grids. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=411.18s)]
*  So, you know, one of the deals that was done between the president and Joe Manchin was [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=414.21999999999997s)]
*  the permitting bill. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=417.46s)]
*  That permitting bill is for pipelines. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=418.46s)]
*  We need to get gas to Louisiana, to get that Louisiana gas to Europe to help our allies [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=420.58s)]
*  and reduce the cost there. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=425.94s)]
*  That also reduces their coal usage. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=427.42s)]
*  So it's very green if you look at it on the margin. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=429.42s)]
*  And so it gets very complicated. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=432.5s)]
*  And we just need to do the work. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=435.18s)]
*  Are people here hearing what you're trying to explain in terms of market dynamics and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=436.3s)]
*  investment? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=441.1s)]
*  So I think it's sometimes justifiable when people talk across each other because damage [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=442.1s)]
*  was done. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=445.9s)]
*  There was damage done in the financial crisis. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=446.9s)]
*  Not all the big banks would have failed and not everyone was equally guilty and all that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=448.21999999999997s)]
*  But and then, of course, people have simple political slogans that, you know, get them [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=451.38s)]
*  elected or something. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=455.34s)]
*  But I think there's a lot of talk. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=456.74s)]
*  We talk all the time to the Biden administration at multiple levels. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=459.18s)]
*  And we should. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=462.58s)]
*  You know, I'm going to help any president to try to do the best job for America. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=463.58s)]
*  And those conversations are pretty intense. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=466.58s)]
*  You had said in this country you were happy about the midterm results. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=468.78s)]
*  On both parties, the kind of the wing nuts didn't get elected. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=472.41999999999996s)]
*  So the rational thing, I was just in Congress, I was gratified by the thought they want to [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=477.38s)]
*  make progress. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=481.66s)]
*  And I think they can make progress. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=482.74s)]
*  So we're days away from this government funding deadline. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=484.62s)]
*  And Congress is going to have to pass a bill to avoid a shutdown. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=488.7s)]
*  The risk is once power shifts come January, that it could become a bigger problem. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=491.74s)]
*  I would say government funding, look, it's not the way to run a railroad. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=496.06s)]
*  It's not the way to run a railroad. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=499.34s)]
*  I mean, basically, you end up spending much more money, too, because the American public [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=501.34s)]
*  I know you pay people and then you pay them more to come back to work. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=504.14s)]
*  It costs us much more money. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=507.82s)]
*  So even if you want to be fiscally responsible, it's not a good idea. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=509.5s)]
*  The debt ceiling is you talk about June of next year and we'll deal with that later. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=511.9s)]
*  Right. Well, there's some debate about whether it should be done now in these last few weeks [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=515.66s)]
*  while Democrats still have control to avoid that kind of shutdown. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=518.6999999999999s)]
*  They should, because the catastrophic effects of an actual default, not the debates, I [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=521.5s)]
*  understand both sides, how they want to use it, is that's catastrophic or potentially [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=526.62s)]
*  catastrophic. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=532.1s)]
*  I would never take that risk. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=533.1s)]
*  So for me, yes, I'd get it done now. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=534.5s)]
*  Take it off the table. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=537.5s)]
*  So you said back in 2019 on CNBC, my heart is Democratic, but my brain is kind of Republican. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=538.5s)]
*  The world's changed a lot since 2019. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=544.62s)]
*  I wonder what you were thinking right now. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=546.9s)]
*  I'm kind of the same place. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=549.5s)]
*  I just think we need rational policy, you know, really rational policy. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=551.1s)]
*  And that a lot of that policy is not Democrat or Republican. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=555.02s)]
*  Gain proper infrastructure built and not Democrat or Republican. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=558.22s)]
*  We should all acknowledge that inner city schools don't work particularly well in a [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=561.06s)]
*  lot of areas. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=564.4599999999999s)]
*  Half the kids don't graduate. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=565.4599999999999s)]
*  That's not Democratic or Republican. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=566.5799999999999s)]
*  That's acknowledging the problem and then talking about solutions. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=567.9799999999999s)]
*  Health care, we have the best in the world. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=571.3s)]
*  Hell, I'm a beneficiary of it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=573.02s)]
*  But we also have some of the worst. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=574.7399999999999s)]
*  Costs almost 20 percent of GDP, 50 million people uninsured, huge obesity, high blood [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=576.38s)]
*  pressure, a lot of things which are fixable. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=581.26s)]
*  And I can go on and on and on. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=583.9s)]
*  We need good policy, you know, good and no policy, sometimes bad policy. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=585.06s)]
*  Face the Nation will be back in one minute with more from our interview with Jamie Dimon. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=590.9399999999999s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=594.98s)]
*  Here's more of our interview with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=599.5799999999999s)]
*  I want to ask you about China. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=603.5799999999999s)]
*  It looks like they are loosening some of their COVID restrictions, maybe moving away from [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=605.54s)]
*  COVID zero. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=610.18s)]
*  How do you see this impacting the long and short term? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=611.5s)]
*  I think they want to get their economy going again. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=614.38s)]
*  They're not going to be a massive function of capital, COVID laws, trade and things like that. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=616.34s)]
*  And they've just started to have real conversations where they said they're going to with the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=621.94s)]
*  Biden administration. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=625.1s)]
*  The most important thing about China and America is that we actually talk, that we actually [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=626.38s)]
*  get engaged at a detailed level about what we agree, what we disagree and try to resolve [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=629.94s)]
*  these things. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=634.46s)]
*  Then also work on some of the things we've got to do together. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=635.46s)]
*  Climate, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, bioterrorism. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=638.0600000000001s)]
*  That's in all our interest to fix those problems. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=643.34s)]
*  You can't do it without America and China. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=645.5s)]
*  Because it's not just the second largest economy in the world. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=647.34s)]
*  Our countries are incredibly intertwined. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=649.94s)]
*  They're incredibly intertwined. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=652.46s)]
*  But what you really need is American leadership to do this and to bring our allies in. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=654.5s)]
*  If we do it just bilaterally, it will not work. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=659.9000000000001s)]
*  Because the Chinese will go negotiate separate, better deals with God knows how many different [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=663.82s)]
*  countries. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=668.26s)]
*  So we need to do it in combination with our allies. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=669.26s)]
*  The US and China are in direct competition and the chances of conflict are rising on [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=671.02s)]
*  the national security front. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=676.02s)]
*  The former Goldman Sachs CEO and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson has warned the two [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=677.7s)]
*  economies are just too intertwined to separate at this point. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=681.1800000000001s)]
*  How do you think about that and the increased conversation about trying to find separate [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=684.82s)]
*  supply chains and weaning ourselves off of cheap Chinese manufacturing? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=690.82s)]
*  What we need is tough negotiations. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=696.1s)]
*  So national security, that's going to be about semiconductors, rare earths, penicillins. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=698.4200000000001s)]
*  That's unilateral. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=704.26s)]
*  The Chinese do that. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=705.26s)]
*  We do it. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=706.26s)]
*  Most businesses support it. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=707.26s)]
*  That gets very complicated. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=708.58s)]
*  We talk about export controls and investment controls. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=709.58s)]
*  But basically the government's working with people like us and a lot of other companies. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=712.38s)]
*  How do you implement something like that that is good for national security but doesn't [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=715.4200000000001s)]
*  diminish American business doing well overseas? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=719.98s)]
*  Some of that alternative would be that we need better development finance, better diplomacy. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=722.14s)]
*  We need better rules around how banks or companies can go down and invest in foreign [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=726.42s)]
*  countries to do things that make sense. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=729.9799999999999s)]
*  But you're just saying the State Department and those other softer bits of diplomacy need [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=732.5s)]
*  to be beefed up. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=736.54s)]
*  Immediately. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=737.54s)]
*  Well, when you talk about and you reference their investment in semiconductors here, electric [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=738.54s)]
*  vehicles, that kind of thing, that's part of the Biden administration's domestic economic [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=742.74s)]
*  revitalization, but it is national security policy as well. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=747.4599999999999s)]
*  There are some critics who say that that's causing a little bit of market distortion [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=750.3s)]
*  there. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=753.9399999999999s)]
*  It does. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=754.9399999999999s)]
*  This stuff gets complicated. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=756.34s)]
*  And remember, it gets written by Congress. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=757.34s)]
*  So the body is pretty good, but it has really irritated the Europeans because it's by America, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=760.1s)]
*  built America. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=766.1s)]
*  It's a huge disadvantage for a part of the world we need very good relations with. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=767.1s)]
*  The president did say we can tweak it, modify it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=771.1400000000001s)]
*  The electric vehicles. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=774.1400000000001s)]
*  And I think that could be done. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=775.1400000000001s)]
*  But here's the really important part of this. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=776.62s)]
*  It's not just that. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=778.9000000000001s)]
*  If Europe goes its own way in trade and they said they're going to do their own IRA bill, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=780.6600000000001s)]
*  be their own trade bloc by America, by Europe, build Europe, that is very bad for the global [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=784.58s)]
*  negotiators of trade. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=790.46s)]
*  That is very bad for national security. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=792.5s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=795.5s)]
*  Jamie Dimon was in West Baltimore last week to mark the opening of Chase Bank's latest [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=800.5s)]
*  community branch, part of a 30 billion dollar program that helps underserved communities [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=805.46s)]
*  improve banking access, financial education and economic mobility. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=810.34s)]
*  We asked him about the community banking program and the gaps that JPMorgan Chase hopes to [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=814.94s)]
*  address. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=819.34s)]
*  So in coming in here, JPMorgan has to change some of the parameters because you're reaching [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=820.74s)]
*  people who are unbanked. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=824.7800000000001s)]
*  How do you know if someone is creditworthy, if they've never owned a home, they've never [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=826.5400000000001s)]
*  had a bank account? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=830.26s)]
*  When you're here and you ask and you know the neighborhoods and you work with government, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=831.46s)]
*  you do multiple things, you can do use other facts that are not used in traditional underwriting. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=835.38s)]
*  Like, have you paid rent for 10 years? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=839.66s)]
*  So you and I would both say if there is a mother or father or family paying rent for [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=842.18s)]
*  10 years, that's a good credit science. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=845.9s)]
*  We take a little bit of a stretch on that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=848.2s)]
*  The government here came up with a very special program to put in the seed money to rehab [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=849.9s)]
*  the whole bloc. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=855.14s)]
*  Once they rehab the whole bloc, we can step in and start making mortgages so people can [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=856.54s)]
*  buy the homes and live there. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=860.34s)]
*  And so there are multiple plans to do it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=861.9s)]
*  On the Entrepreneur of Color fund that we do, small businesses, you know, we give them an [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=864.8s)]
*  advisor too. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=869.24s)]
*  That gives us great comfort that they're doing the right things. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=870.44s)]
*  In this moment we are in right now, you have mortgage rates of about 7%. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=873.02s)]
*  Six and a half, yeah. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=878.28s)]
*  It's hard to get access, but the Fed's also trying to cool off a housing market bubble. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=880.2s)]
*  We look right through that and we will look past the actual rates. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=885.48s)]
*  And remember, the important thing about mortgages, and this is why I do criticize some public [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=888.4s)]
*  policies sometimes, mortgages are how most Americans got their net worth. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=892.36s)]
*  And if you can't get a smaller mortgage to buy a house, it's hard to build your net [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=897.4s)]
*  worth. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=900.44s)]
*  Mortgages are also, by the way, how often people funded their small business dark. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=901.44s)]
*  So it is absolutely critical. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=905.14s)]
*  And one of the things we've been trying to change a little bit is because of all excessive [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=907.04s)]
*  rules now, and I'm talking about things that would make risk worse, about origination, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=911.24s)]
*  servicing, securitization, the cost of a small mortgage is probably 50 basis points [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=915.72s)]
*  higher than it should be. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=920.12s)]
*  So that $150,000 mortgage or $200,000 mortgage is less affordable by a lot of people. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=921.16s)]
*  And that's because of regulatory policy. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=926.48s)]
*  That's not because of bank policy. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=929.12s)]
*  A critic would say a big bad Wall Street bank is loading debt onto poor people. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=930.12s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=935.8000000000001s)]
*  We're not trying to load debt on anyone. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=936.8000000000001s)]
*  We want to make good mortgages. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=938.6800000000001s)]
*  We want to do good small business loans. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  We want to educate people how to open an account, how to save money. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=941.16s)]
*  We've got products that are special for lower income communities, stuff like that. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=944.6s)]
*  We are going to do that. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=948.64s)]
*  It is good for this community. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhsTWd7U9Dg&t=949.9200000000001s)]
