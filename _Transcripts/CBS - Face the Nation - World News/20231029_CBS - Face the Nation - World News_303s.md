# Attacks on U.S. installations in Middle East could "change the calculus," Gen. Joseph Votel says
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM)
*  We go now to General Joseph Votel, former CENTCOM commander overseeing operations in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=0.0s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=5.24s)]
*  General, it's good to have you with us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=6.24s)]
*  I want to pick up where we left off with the National Security Advisor. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=8.0s)]
*  He said the U.S. has elevated threats against U.S. forces, elevated risk of the conflict [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=12.32s)]
*  spreading. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=17.76s)]
*  What are the trigger points you are concerned about? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=19.04s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=22.04s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=23.04s)]
*  It's good to be with you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=24.04s)]
*  I think the thing that I've been concerned about and probably many have been concerned [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=26.38s)]
*  about is that any miscalculation along the line can move this to a different level. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=30.18s)]
*  An attack on an American installation, whether it's military or diplomatic or commercial [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=36.26s)]
*  that causes casualties, significant casualties and death, I think could significantly change [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=43.54s)]
*  the calculus for us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=48.94s)]
*  And certainly a much broader attack by the so-called Iranian threat network here, whether [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=52.1s)]
*  it's Hezbollah or whether it's Iranian-aligned militia groups in Syria, to broaden the conflict. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=58.1s)]
*  I think these are all aspects that could lead to a widening of the conflict. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=64.7s)]
*  There have already been 20 militia attacks on U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  There are about 19 service people who suffered from traumatic brain injuries. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=74.58s)]
*  One contractor died. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=79.82s)]
*  How do you understand that level of aggression? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=82.25999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's very clear. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=84.74s)]
*  I mean, Iran is behind this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=87.61999999999999s)]
*  Their elements in Iraq and to some extent in Syria are perpetrating these attacks. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=90.5s)]
*  And as the national security advisor said, we've got to hold them accountable for that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=96.41999999999999s)]
*  And so it is critically important to not just be responsive, but to be directly responsive, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=102.17999999999999s)]
*  to be forceful in our manner. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=106.78s)]
*  Ultimately, what we need to do is compel these elements, and Iran was behind all of this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=109.17999999999999s)]
*  to stop this type of action right now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=114.86s)]
*  In Israel, their prime minister said yesterday this is going to be a long war and we're in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=118.94s)]
*  the second phase. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=123.7s)]
*  You just heard Jake Sullivan say the U.S. is still asking questions like, what exactly [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=125.5s)]
*  are the objectives? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=130.9s)]
*  How do you describe what the IDF is doing right now in Gaza? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=132.82s)]
*  Well, I think what the IDF is doing is I think the task they've probably been given is to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=137.06s)]
*  destroy the war-making capacity of Hamas. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=141.7s)]
*  So they are going after command and control locations. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=145.54s)]
*  They are going after logistics locations. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=149.78s)]
*  They are going after headquarters locations. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=151.7s)]
*  And they're going after the likely sites that Hamas would use to perpetrate missile strikes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  or rocket strikes onto Israel. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  From my perspective, it's pretty clear what the Israeli military is doing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=164.42s)]
*  I think their job is to destroy that war-making capacity of Hamas. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=168.54s)]
*  Should they stop once capturing Gaza City? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=175.26s)]
*  Well, again, I think they'll have to make an assessment of their progress. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=178.62s)]
*  Most of the effort now seems to be in the northern part of Gaza and around Gaza City, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=186.22s)]
*  which I think is, as most people who study this will recognize, are the primary areas [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  where Hamas operates. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=197.1s)]
*  So they've definitely directed their operations against the places where Hamas is. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=199.89999999999998s)]
*  And I think they're actually approaching this in an incremental manner. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=205.82s)]
*  I think we've seen introduction of additional forces over the last couple days. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  So they're thinking about it that way. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=213.45999999999998s)]
*  And of course, like any military force would do, they have to take assessments of their [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=215.89999999999998s)]
*  progress as they continue with their operations. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=220.34s)]
*  There is concern about another front here outside of Gaza. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=224.02s)]
*  And I know on Wednesday, President Biden said he is alarmed by, quote, extremist settlers [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=227.74s)]
*  attacking Palestinians in the West Bank in, quote, places they're entitled to be. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=233.54s)]
*  One of Israel's government ministers, Ben Revere, has video of him arming Israeli civilians [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=239.18s)]
*  with M16 and M4 assault rifles. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=246.26s)]
*  How concerned are you about an uptick in violence in the West Bank? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=250.7s)]
*  Well, again, I think this goes back to what we just talked about a few moments ago, the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=254.66s)]
*  miscalculations. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=259.46s)]
*  I mean, this is a tinderbox. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=260.46s)]
*  And so when you have people that are scared, they have weapons, they're trying to protect [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=263.42s)]
*  themselves, then the chances for something going wrong in this, I think, increase. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=267.74s)]
*  So yeah, and the rhetoric has been very strong about this, about the vulnerability and the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=273.26s)]
*  fact that Israeli settlers in the West Bank are targets. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=281.06s)]
*  I mean, that's essentially what these Islamic movements have been saying. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=285.18s)]
*  So I think it's an ordinary critical situation. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=292.26s)]
*  It could flow out very quickly. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  General Votel, thank you for your analysis today. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7_ikmGzQMM&t=299.7s)]
