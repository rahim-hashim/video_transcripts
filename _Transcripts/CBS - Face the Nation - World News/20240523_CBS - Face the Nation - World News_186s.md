# Rishi Sunak's rainy announcement about U.K. election draws reactions
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE)
*  Campaigning is underway in the UK's general election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=0.0s)]
*  Current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced yesterday that the next election would take [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=3.5s)]
*  place on July 4th. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=7.44s)]
*  CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Charlie Daggett is following the latest for us from [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  London. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=12.88s)]
*  So Charlie, why call this election now and what has the reaction been like? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=13.88s)]
*  Lindsey, shocked, confused. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=17.68s)]
*  Some people are calling it political suicide, a kamikaze decision. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=20.84s)]
*  And those are from some of his own party members. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=25.42s)]
*  Part of it had to do with the optics, right? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=28.82s)]
*  So he came out in the pouring rain. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=30.62s)]
*  Some people said he's not so much drenched as drowning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=32.54s)]
*  And I gotta pull up some of these headlines, big cliche, but I gotta show you these, right? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=34.74s)]
*  Drowning out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=39.06s)]
*  This comes from the Daily Telegraph, which is sometimes nicknamed the Tory graph for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=41.5s)]
*  the support of the Tories, the conservatives, right? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  Gambles on a snap pole. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=50.02s)]
*  Things can only get wetter. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=52.06s)]
*  A reference to a song that brought the Labour Party to power. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=54.5s)]
*  Things can only get better. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=60.3s)]
*  This one is a bit more sort of obscure. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=62.26s)]
*  It's O Ballots. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=65.58s)]
*  It's kind of a reference to a rude word that I can't say, but the point may get me there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=67.02s)]
*  But this is what it says on the sign. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  So just when you're looking forward to the Euros, you know, the European Cup is taking [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  place this summer. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=77.62s)]
*  Taylor Swift, Wimbledon and Sunshine, Rishi calls a bloody election. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=78.86s)]
*  Their words, not mine. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=84.1s)]
*  So yes, the timing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=85.86s)]
*  Why the Fourth of July, as we would call it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=86.97999999999999s)]
*  Everybody was including myself. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=90.69999999999999s)]
*  We were all thinking it was going to happen October, November, possibly following the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=91.69999999999999s)]
*  U.S. elections just because there's so much instability in the world. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=96.61999999999999s)]
*  Now, why would he do it now? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=99.3s)]
*  That's what many commentators are asking. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=101.5s)]
*  So you know, the country has been in a tailspin for a number of months. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  We had double digit inflation. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=108.5s)]
*  We had outrageous interest rates that soared mortgages, myself included, unfortunately. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=111.36s)]
*  It's just been a tough time for the UK. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=117.24s)]
*  Now, recently, there have been some pretty good numbers. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=119.76s)]
*  As of yesterday, anyway, inflation is down to 2.3 percent. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=121.82s)]
*  And before that, they just, the country just creeped out of recession. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=126.28s)]
*  So there are some positives there, but they are 20 points behind, at least in most polls [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=130.48s)]
*  against the Labour Party. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=137.44s)]
*  And remember, Rishi Sunak was not elected. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=139.16s)]
*  OK, so he's he follows five, six, I think, for those keeping count at home. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=142.84s)]
*  So after David Cameron came Theresa May, then there was Boris Johnson, then there was Liz [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=151.6s)]
*  Truss, if you remember, for 45 days, and now Rishi Sunak. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=156.64s)]
*  And as I said, behind. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=160.28s)]
*  So people are saying it's a heck of a gamble. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  You would have thought that they'd need more time to catch up to the conservatives, maybe [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=163.72s)]
*  in the autumn. But yeah, what's going to happen? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=167.92s)]
*  Fourth of July. Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=169.68s)]
*  You gave us a good overview. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=172.12s)]
*  I thought the same thing. I was also a little jealous. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=173.6s)]
*  I thought, oh, my gosh, six weeks till election. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=175.44s)]
*  We've been in campaign season forever on this side of the pond. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  I love the idea of a snap election. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=181.04s)]
*  Charlie, thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q8HL-CGmlE&t=183.92s)]
