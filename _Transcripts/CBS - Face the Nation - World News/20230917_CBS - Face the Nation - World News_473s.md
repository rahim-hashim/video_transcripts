# Sean Penn, "Superpower" co-director, says U.S.' Ukraine policy has been a "tragic mistake"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc)
*  Actor and director Sean Penn is the co-director of a new documentary called [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=0.0s)]
*  Superpower. It's about President Zelensky and the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Zelensky agreed to meet with Penn in person for the first time on camera on [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=8.76s)]
*  the same day Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=12.96s)]
*  The great, great that you are here. It's very important now, all this support. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  You always, I think, Americans have to hear. So I think you see that we are just [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=23.4s)]
*  ordinary people who want to live in our country. Yeah, and now you're here. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  It's, I mean, it's so dangerous to be here at this time in this country with you, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=39.56s)]
*  with your countrymen. I mean, it's such, there's so much inspiration we had here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  We spoke with Penn on Friday about his new film. In one of the clips, Andre [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=51.2s)]
*  Yermak, one of the top advisors to President Zelensky, says to you, you know, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=56.68s)]
*  the U.S. position should be stronger if the United States and Joe Biden doesn't [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  do something now. Essentially, he says America's over. That followed with a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=63.28s)]
*  pretty robust financial investment by the United States, more than 50 billion [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=68.4s)]
*  dollars, pledges of weapons. But from what I've heard you say, you think the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  United States isn't doing enough. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=77.8s)]
*  It is my absolute feeling that the caution with which the United States has [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=81.72s)]
*  pledged support, which seemed in my reading of February 2022, was a, like a [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=91.32s)]
*  lean-on in the fear of nuclear conflict. Something I think all of us should look [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  very carefully at and understand it, of course, is possible. And that's to be [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=110.92s)]
*  concerning. The likelihood is extremely low. And as one of our witnesses in the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=116.44s)]
*  film says, you know, are we going to let a gangster with nuclear weapons dictate [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=122.84s)]
*  the way we live? So I think that and that the Ukrainians won't let him do that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=130.8s)]
*  In the documentary, you spoke with a Ukrainian fighter pilot named Juice, who [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=137.32000000000002s)]
*  I understand was killed later in a training incident. Was your personal [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=141.8s)]
*  connection to him and his the case he made to you part of why you are pushing [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  this point on F-16 so strongly? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  I was pushing it when I was with Juice and he was alive. He dreamt of flying F-16s. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=152.96s)]
*  I think that he was a man who was born into a time where he had to do this [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=158.16s)]
*  extreme thing and he did it with poise and skill and focus and compassion. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=162.88s)]
*  And so he had come to Washington to lobby for the F-16s and also was buying [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=170.36s)]
*  helmets for his helicopter pilot friends on eBay here to bring back. So it was [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=176.72s)]
*  like that. And then I suppose now, was it July that it was announced that there [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=184.88s)]
*  would now be an F-16 program, those resources. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Eventually. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=194.96s)]
*  Yeah, over a long period of time. And a couple of weeks later, I got the message [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=196.12s)]
*  that he'd been killed. I think not only would Juice be alive today, if we had [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=202.6s)]
*  been as bold as we like to claim to be historically as a country with our [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  principles, with our Republicans and our Democrats, with our leadership, the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=215.88s)]
*  citizenry too. While we're putting all those Ukrainian flags out, we should have [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  demand decisiveness in this case because at some point, caution becomes cowardice. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=228.56s)]
*  But there's still an opportunity for us to do the right thing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=235.36s)]
*  Fifty eight percent of Americans polled by CBS disapprove of the way Joe Biden [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=244.28s)]
*  is handling the situation with Russia and Ukraine. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=248.64s)]
*  And I'm getting the sense from you, you're disappointed too. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=251.2s)]
*  Yeah, I respect President Biden very much. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=254.4s)]
*  There have been a couple of things that I think have been disasters up to this [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=256.56s)]
*  point. There should be an implicit understanding between private citizens [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=259.68s)]
*  and leaders in government that there are things that I don't know about, things [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  that should be, need to remain classified. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=271.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  So every day, even when I was with Juice, I was privately thinking, yes, it's our [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  job to fight this fight. But privately, I was thinking, but maybe they are doing it [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=283.0s)]
*  behind closed doors and tomorrow we're going to wake up to that squadron. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=288.24s)]
*  Enough time has passed. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=293.08s)]
*  I think it's been to date a tragic mistake. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=294.8s)]
*  And I hope and encourage this president that he deserves the legacy of doing this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  properly. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=305.32s)]
*  Polling also shows big majorities of Americans continue to support economic [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  sanctions on Russia. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  Sixty one percent of Republicans, though, say the U.S. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=311.2s)]
*  should not send weapons to Ukraine. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=313.4s)]
*  Fifty percent say the U.S. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=315.76s)]
*  should not send aid and supplies to Ukraine. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=316.88s)]
*  That is a big shift from where the Republican Party was in terms of in the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=320.16s)]
*  past being very strong on Russia. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=324.32s)]
*  But some of it in terms of the rhetoric reflects this sense that America needs to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=326.64s)]
*  fix itself at home. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=330.92s)]
*  How do you respond to to that thinking? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=332.48s)]
*  I think there's more than a compelling argument that would change those minds. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=336.32s)]
*  And I understand why they're confused. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'm hoping in its little way that this film can help context. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=344.96s)]
*  I would be confused if I hadn't had the opportunity to do this. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=350.24s)]
*  Better communication of the why and the justification for the billions of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=353.88s)]
*  dollars. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=358.4s)]
*  Yeah, if the current leadership would just do one thing now, it would be the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  president saying to his cabinet, we are not spinning the story on Ukraine [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=365.12s)]
*  anymore. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=371.92s)]
*  So if it's about what are they capable of, we're going to let our commanders in [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=373.44s)]
*  Fresno at the Cal National Guard that's been doing joint military exercises with [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=378.0s)]
*  them for 30 years, tell us what their capability is. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=382.24s)]
*  And we're going to say it unfiltered to the American people. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  You end the documentary talking about this feeling of unity you had when you [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  were in Ukraine and you compare it to what you see here at home and you [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=392.88s)]
*  actually end on the images of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Congresswoman, and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=396.0s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=402.4s)]
*  And you say we're going backwards. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=404.79999999999995s)]
*  Why do you think they symbolize that? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  I think that we've come to a point where we as the voters, we as the citizens [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=410.88s)]
*  have to look at our politicians and say, look, you're very smart. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=420.32s)]
*  We agree with your policy. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=424.96s)]
*  Why would you want to call it socialist? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=428.08s)]
*  Why would you want to put up a middle finger to people who have a reaction to [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=430.24s)]
*  that? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=436.0s)]
*  You're a leader. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=437.12s)]
*  Just get the policy across. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=438.48s)]
*  I'm not interested in these people self celebrating or grandstanding. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=440.64s)]
*  Jerks like me do enough of that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=446.4s)]
*  Leaders can't do that anymore. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=449.2s)]
*  And so on the right, on the left, we have to demand that people actually are [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=452.0s)]
*  accountable for the accountable and ourselves for the division that we have [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=458.64s)]
*  and break it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=465.76s)]
*  Thank you, Sean Penn, for sharing your work with us and Superpower debuts on [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=466.72s)]
*  Paramount Plus on Monday. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmJnf0Gofc&t=471.2s)]
