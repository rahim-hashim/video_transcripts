# North Korea claims new ICBM is "the world's strongest" missile
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0)
*  North Korea has released footage claiming to show it is test launching an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=0.0s)]
*  intercontinental ballistic missile with the range to strike the mainland United [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  States. This comes as North Korea's foreign minister has said her country [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=9.32s)]
*  will back Russia until it achieves victory in its war in Ukraine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=12.6s)]
*  Joining us now for more on all this is CBS News Pentagon correspondent Ellie [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=16.16s)]
*  Watson. So Ellie what more are we learning about this launch and what [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=20.88s)]
*  fallout has there been if any? This launch appears to have had the longest [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=26.16s)]
*  flight time ever recorded for a North Korean missile, 13 minutes longer than [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=31.04s)]
*  the previous record and has the range theoretically capable of reaching the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=35.04s)]
*  United States. The test wasn't really a surprise though. In fact the South Korean [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=39.08s)]
*  defense minister was here on Wednesday at the Pentagon warning that North [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Korea may do something like this to exaggerate its existence around the time [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=47.72s)]
*  election. That being said this was the first ICBM test North Korea has done [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=52.84s)]
*  since last December and comes as there are concerns about what North Korea may [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  be asking Russia for in return for providing Russia with thousands of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=61.080000000000005s)]
*  troops for its war in Ukraine. The South Korean defense minister said North Korea [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=64.64s)]
*  is likely to ask Russia for some cutting-edge technology to advance its [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=70.04s)]
*  weapons program programs including the intercontinental ballistic missile [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=73.68s)]
*  program. So Ellie those troops that this quid pro quo with Russia that you're [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=77.44s)]
*  talking about we know that North Korean troops are in Russia any sense as if [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  whether or not they are engaging with Ukrainian troops? The latest we've heard [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=87.96s)]
*  is that about 8,000 of the 10,000 North Korean troops in Russia have moved to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  the Kursk area of Russia and are likely to participate in combat [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=97.44s)]
*  operations against Ukrainians in the next several days. That was according to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=103.08s)]
*  Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=107.64s)]
*  yesterday. Russia has been suffering significant casualties as many as 1200 [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=111.08s)]
*  per day while trying to push Ukrainian forces out of the Kursk area of Russian [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  Russia and keep the pressure on the Ukrainian front lines in eastern Ukraine. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=120.24s)]
*  These North Korean troops outfitted in Russian uniforms and using Russian [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=126.12s)]
*  equipment could be Putin's way of trying to solve the problem of Kursk [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=131.28s)]
*  without suffering even higher Russian casualties and without calling for a mass [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=134.24s)]
*  mobilization that would be pretty unpopular within Russia. All right Ellie [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=138.04s)]
*  Watson reporting this morning from the Pentagon for us. Thank you Ellie. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=142.8s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXOZzRZp0&t=145.44s)]
