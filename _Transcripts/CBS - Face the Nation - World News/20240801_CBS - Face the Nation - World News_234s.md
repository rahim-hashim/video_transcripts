# How lawmakers are reacting to prisoner swap involving Russia, U.S. and other countries
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk)
*  We have been covering this major breaking news you're seeing on your screen right now, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=0.0s)]
*  a plane on a tarmac there in Turkey. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=4.28s)]
*  There is a big prisoner swap underway currently, and exact movements and whereabouts of the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=6.36s)]
*  prisoners that we have been mentioning aren't exactly clear to us right now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=11.52s)]
*  We're working to gather more information on that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=14.92s)]
*  But some names that you have been hearing, Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan, they're part [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=17.28s)]
*  of the prisoner swap, as well as being swapped for a Putin ally who is jailed in Germany [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=21.92s)]
*  and convicted of murder there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=29.4s)]
*  For more reaction from Capitol Hill, let's go to Congressional correspondent Scott McFarland. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Scott, what are you hearing? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=35.44s)]
*  Well, there is this dual political message that's beginning to emanate as the morning [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  concludes here in Washington, Lindsay. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=42.36s)]
*  There are Republicans, including the House Republican Chair Elise Stefano, criticizing [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=44.2s)]
*  the nature of any agreement that releases dangerous Russians as part of an agreement. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=49.44s)]
*  Michael McCaul, who is the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs panel here in the U.S. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=55.38s)]
*  House, has also said, while grateful for the return of these heroic Americans, there is [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=59.14s)]
*  concern that there is an exchange that could incentivize future hostage-taking. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=64.02000000000001s)]
*  I expect to hear a lot more of that on the campaign trail as J.D. Vance and former President [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  Trump make their arguments today and among House and Senate Republicans as they make [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=75.66s)]
*  their arguments through the day here at the Capitol. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  As for the president's supporters in Congress, they are championing what they would say is [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=83.1s)]
*  not only the release of Americans who long ago should have been released, but by the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  stewardship of the administration to get this done now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=92.5s)]
*  Do you expect that the concern and applause will be divided along party lines with this [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=97.06s)]
*  issue, Scott? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=102.86s)]
*  I sure do. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=103.86s)]
*  I think this is one of those things that, though in a more fundamental dynamic, it transcends [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=104.86s)]
*  everybody is grateful for their safe return. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=110.02s)]
*  This in no way is going to transcend politics when it comes to the machinations used to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=114.14s)]
*  secure their release. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=119.1s)]
*  This will be a campaign issue that is wielded, no doubt, by Republicans arguing too high [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=120.34s)]
*  a price had to be paid to get these hostages back. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=125.26s)]
*  Take a look at the statement from Philadelphia Congressman Brendan Boyle there on the screen. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=129.46s)]
*  There's yet another sobering reminder of how evil the Putin regime really is. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=133.94s)]
*  There is a synchronization, Lindsay, among both parties that the Putin regime is in fact [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=142.34s)]
*  evil. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=147.74s)]
*  And there's another statement. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=148.74s)]
*  Haley Stevens is a Democrat from suburban Detroit saying, your family have been tireless [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=149.74s)]
*  advocates and we cannot wait to see you reunited. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=154.54s)]
*  So you have that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=158.34s)]
*  You have Democrats championing the president for his stewardship. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=159.34s)]
*  You'll have Republicans saying that these types of negotiations may trigger more hostage [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=162.3s)]
*  taking in the future. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=166.58s)]
*  You can't suck out the politics from all of this, even though there of course is unanimity [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=168.06s)]
*  in the express of relief that these these hostages are coming back home. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=173.42s)]
*  You said it unity and expressive relief. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=178.34s)]
*  Have the families of Evan Gershkovich or Paul Whelan met with Congress? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=180.5s)]
*  Have they spoken in front of Congress before? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=184.38s)]
*  The supporters of these families and these families themselves have been actively vocalizing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=187.58s)]
*  their hopes, their aspirations with Congress. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=194.3s)]
*  And there are congressional panels that have gotten into this, had their own investigations, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=196.78s)]
*  had their own hearings. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=200.46s)]
*  But this is a unilateral move, really, to a degree of the executive branch. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=201.5s)]
*  This is the president and the president's team leading this effort. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=206.66s)]
*  Congress can offer its opinions, can offer funding to help support protective efforts. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=211.06s)]
*  But this really is the administration's world. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=215.38s)]
*  Congress, though, is certainly going to give their opinions as the day continues. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=218.54s)]
*  Scott McFarland, thank you so much. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  And we continue to follow the latest on this prisoner swap between Russia and the U.S. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=223.74s)]
*  Our coverage continues right on the other side of this break. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=227.54s)]
*  You're streaming CBS News 24 seven. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tBdldeYCk&t=230.62s)]
