# British ambassador to U.S. says Queen Elizabeth leaves "positive legacy" with Commonwealth countries
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw)
*  We're joined now by Dame Karen Pierce, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=0.0s)]
*  United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=2.12s)]
*  and Madam Ambassador. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  Welcome to Face the Nation and our condolences [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=5.96s)]
*  to you and your country. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=7.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  President Biden reminded the country [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=10.46s)]
*  that Queen Elizabeth said, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=12.8s)]
*  grief is the price we pay for love. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=13.92s)]
*  And she said it after the attacks of 9-11. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=15.92s)]
*  I wonder as you look around this town [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=19.22s)]
*  and you see Union Jacks down Pennsylvania Avenue, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  you have this outpouring of sympathy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=24.42s)]
*  Has it surprised you how strong the reaction has been? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, could I start Margaret [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  by also expressing my condolences to the American people [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=33.08s)]
*  on the anniversary of 9-11. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=35.7s)]
*  As you say, that is what the Queen said. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=37.96s)]
*  She also asked that the British institutions [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=40.6s)]
*  fly the American flag after 9-11 [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=43.86s)]
*  and on the 10th and 20th anniversaries. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=46.52s)]
*  So I think it's very good that the mayor and others [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  have put up the British flag, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=52.64s)]
*  it's very kind of them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=53.84s)]
*  We appreciate it very much. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  And yes, I think we were a little bit surprised [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=56.68s)]
*  by quite how many Americans have rallied, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=59.24s)]
*  have come to the embassy to pay their respects, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=62.84s)]
*  have sent us messages. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=65.16s)]
*  We were honored by the president coming to the embassy, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=66.64s)]
*  the vice president and secretary Blinken. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=69.42s)]
*  This is what close allies do, they support each other. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=72.2s)]
*  Nevertheless, it's a very moving thing to see. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=75.68s)]
*  And President Biden, other world leaders have said [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=78.76s)]
*  they will come to the United Kingdom [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=81.42s)]
*  for the funeral next Monday. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=83.56s)]
*  I wanna take a quick break here and come back [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  because we have a lot to talk about. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=89.12s)]
*  You have a lot of change ahead and underway [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=90.68s)]
*  in the United Kingdom and we will have more [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  from the ambassador in just a moment. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=96.4s)]
*  So stay with us. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=97.92s)]
*  ["The Star-Spangled Banner"] [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=103.0s)]
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=106.88s)]
*  We continue our conversation now [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=108.28s)]
*  with the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=110.0s)]
*  Dame Karen Pierce. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=113.02000000000001s)]
*  It's so good to have you here at such a key moment. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  And I wonder as King Charles III, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=118.64s)]
*  and we start to see him in this role on the throne, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=121.5s)]
*  what will change about the contours of the kingdom? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=124.62s)]
*  And I ask that because as I'm sure you've seen, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=127.7s)]
*  there's been a lot written in recent days. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=129.96s)]
*  In the New York Times, there was a columnist, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=133.3s)]
*  Maya Jasnoff, who's a British historian [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=135.66s)]
*  or writes about the empire. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=138.72s)]
*  She said that the Commonwealth really kind of glosses over [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=140.74s)]
*  some of the more bloody forms of British colonialism. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=147.06s)]
*  She said, in her role as queen, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=150.46s)]
*  Elizabeth helped obscure a bloody history [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=152.58s)]
*  of decolonization whose proportions and legacies [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=154.86s)]
*  have yet to be adequately acknowledged. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=157.86s)]
*  It sort of kicked off a debate here. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=160.3s)]
*  And I wonder how you think King Charles will deal with that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=162.46s)]
*  Is he mindful of things like this? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=166.62s)]
*  He's very politically aware and astute [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=170.1s)]
*  and very much aware of the world around him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=172.98s)]
*  I think his first task will be to go [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=176.7s)]
*  around the constituent parts of the UK, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=179.7s)]
*  promoting a message of unity, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=182.74s)]
*  one of respect for the late queen, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=185.46s)]
*  but also one of renewal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=187.34s)]
*  He'll want to show stability in unity and continuity, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=189.34s)]
*  but he has made no secret of the fact [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=193.66s)]
*  there are things he'd like to modernize. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=196.22s)]
*  So we'll wait and see what those are. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=198.06s)]
*  He's a huge supporter of the Commonwealth. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  He becomes head of the Commonwealth. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=203.06s)]
*  And that was decided a few years ago. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  He has gone on record as saying, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=208.1s)]
*  it doesn't matter what sort of government [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  you have in the Commonwealth, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=213.02s)]
*  whether you have a monarchy, whether you have a republic, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=214.06s)]
*  whether you have some other form, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  you are very welcome in the Commonwealth. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=218.82s)]
*  And he wants to do what he can to strengthen [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=220.54s)]
*  that partnership of equal nations. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=223.06s)]
*  I want to stress the equal. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=226.18s)]
*  We can't pretend we have a different history. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=229.26000000000002s)]
*  There are good things and bad, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=232.02s)]
*  and we need to talk about them. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=233.5s)]
*  But I think that assessment is too negative. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=236.3s)]
*  I would say that one of the overwhelmingly positive things [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=240.82s)]
*  that came out of the Queen's 70 years [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=244.58s)]
*  was the transition from empire to Commonwealth, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=247.62s)]
*  was the transition to having a fellowship [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=252.26000000000002s)]
*  of sovereign equal nations who will come together [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=255.9s)]
*  every two years, head of government and head of state level, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=260.06s)]
*  and who do an awful lot EG on trade in between. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=263.94s)]
*  So I think that's a positive legacy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=267.62s)]
*  And I think most countries in the Commonwealth [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=270.42s)]
*  would feel that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  The UK has had such tremendous change. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=273.42s)]
*  Four prime ministers in the past six years, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=275.42s)]
*  a new prime minister just in recent days as well, Liz Truss. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=278.14s)]
*  I want to ask you about the US-UK relationship [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=283.1s)]
*  because President Biden has made clear [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=285.66s)]
*  when it comes to relations, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  for him, protecting the peace in Northern Ireland [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=289.70000000000005s)]
*  is of utmost importance. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=293.18s)]
*  And this looks like it could be a point of difference [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=295.1s)]
*  because the US has warned the UK not to hold a vote [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=298.3s)]
*  on this legislation that could affect the creation [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=300.5s)]
*  or not of a hard border between North and South Ireland. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=302.82000000000005s)]
*  Do you believe that vote will happen? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=306.46000000000004s)]
*  And what happens to US relations if that goes ahead? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=310.14000000000004s)]
*  So I think the first thing to say is that the president [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=313.74s)]
*  had a very warm discussion with the prime minister [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=316.14s)]
*  when she was first appointed. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=319.02s)]
*  They talked about the special relationship. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=320.62s)]
*  They talked about what Britain and the US can do together, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=322.34s)]
*  promoting democracy and open societies around the world [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=325.38s)]
*  and the need to push back on authoritarianism. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=328.58s)]
*  So as the Queen herself said, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=331.34s)]
*  what brings us together is far stronger [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=333.38s)]
*  than any individual issue that may divide us. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=336.09999999999997s)]
*  We too in Britain, the prime minister, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=339.62s)]
*  wants to preserve the Good Friday peace agreement [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=342.02000000000004s)]
*  in Northern Ireland. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=344.58000000000004s)]
*  She and the president and the Irish government [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=345.82s)]
*  absolutely share that aim. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  But she's also talked about scrapping parts [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  of that agreement with the EU [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=352.5s)]
*  that specifically deal with that border. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=354.3s)]
*  Well, that is a particular agreement about trade [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=355.14000000000004s)]
*  so that Northern Ireland can trade with Ireland, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=357.86s)]
*  which remains in the European Union, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=361.38s)]
*  and the mainland of Great Britain can also trade [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=364.02000000000004s)]
*  with Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=367.70000000000005s)]
*  And the difficulty arises precisely [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=371.38s)]
*  because we are determined to avoid a hard border [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=374.09999999999997s)]
*  between Northern Ireland and Ireland. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=376.85999999999996s)]
*  We accept that's an enormous gain [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=378.94s)]
*  of the Good Friday agreement. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=381.38s)]
*  It is hard to introduce trading arrangements [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=383.17999999999995s)]
*  that protect the integrity of the EU single market [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=386.46s)]
*  and protect the integrity of the United Kingdom [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=390.14s)]
*  single market when you haven't got a border, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=392.73999999999995s)]
*  but we don't want to introduce a border. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=395.17999999999995s)]
*  The legislation going through parliament [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=397.26s)]
*  is not about a border. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=399.14s)]
*  It's about contingency measures [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=400.98s)]
*  that the government could take if it needed to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=403.38s)]
*  if we cannot reach a negotiated settlement with the EU [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=406.22s)]
*  to make the passage of goods between Northern Ireland [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=410.02000000000004s)]
*  and Ireland smoother than it is now. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=412.98s)]
*  There's lots of disruption to communities. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=415.26s)]
*  They can't get the goods and medicine in Northern Ireland [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=417.86s)]
*  that they need. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=420.38s)]
*  Government needs to sort this out. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=421.38s)]
*  There are a lot of challenges the prime minister faces, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=423.18s)]
*  including economic ones, in large part [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=425.22s)]
*  because of Russia's war on Ukraine. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=427.70000000000005s)]
*  Do you see political risk to the alliance [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=429.9s)]
*  in the months ahead? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=432.17999999999995s)]
*  No, I think the alliance, the NATO alliance, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=434.02s)]
*  has shown that it is stronger than ever. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=436.02s)]
*  There has been a remarkably united response [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=438.65999999999997s)]
*  to President Putin's invasion. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=441.65999999999997s)]
*  The same is true as the transatlantic relationship [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=443.58s)]
*  between Europe as a whole and the United States more broadly. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=446.78s)]
*  Leaders will be able to get together [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=451.34s)]
*  in the forthcoming UN General Assembly, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=453.53999999999996s)]
*  where I think you'll see more outpourings [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=455.94s)]
*  of support for Ukraine. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=458.14000000000004s)]
*  There's no doubt there is a cost of living crisis [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=460.18s)]
*  that's not unique to Britain. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=462.26000000000005s)]
*  We have introduced measures around energy bills [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=464.34000000000003s)]
*  and energy prices to try and help ordinary households. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=466.90000000000003s)]
*  And the Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=470.26000000000005s)]
*  our Treasury Secretary was here recently [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=472.66s)]
*  talking to Secretary Yellen. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=475.1s)]
*  We're looking together at how we can share best practice [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=476.86s)]
*  in what to do to help households. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=479.98s)]
*  Well, we will continue to follow closely [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=481.94s)]
*  in the coming days and weeks. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=484.18s)]
*  Thank you so much, Ambassador. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W78V8QAizw&t=485.26000000000005s)]
