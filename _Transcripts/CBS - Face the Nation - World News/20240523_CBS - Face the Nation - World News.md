# Biden announces intent to make Kenya a major non-NATO ally to U.S.
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso)
*  A lot of excited reporters trying to get in one final question as we watch President Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=0.0s)]
*  and Kenyan President William Ruto speaking following their meeting at the White House, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=6.8s)]
*  marking 60 years of progress between the two democracies. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=11.56s)]
*  President Biden, for his part, announced that he is working with Congress to make Kenya [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=15.36s)]
*  a, quote, major non-NATO ally. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=18.8s)]
*  He also discussed deepening the economic ties between the two countries. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=21.72s)]
*  Reporters always have more to ask, and that's always a good moment to try, at least. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=26.52s)]
*  President Biden said he's looking to make Kenya the first nation on the African continent [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=31.28s)]
*  to get funding through his administration's CHIPS and Science Act. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=35.56s)]
*  Kenya's President Ruto discussed agreements of significant opportunities for the U.S. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  to support Africa with other investments. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  And as we've mentioned, this is the first state visit from a leader of an African nation [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  since 2008. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=49.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=50.56s)]
*  I've heard President Ruto as the head of a country that's not a NATO or not a member [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=51.56s)]
*  of the G20 to make a state visit say that there are many areas that he is cooperating [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  with on the Biden administration. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=62.08s)]
*  That also includes the security situation in Haiti. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=63.52s)]
*  A lot of questions on that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=67.04s)]
*  As there's political instability there and the various gangs have actually taken power, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=68.04s)]
*  Kenya providing about 1,000 physical forces on the ground to stabilize things. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=71.92s)]
*  The U.S. is not doing that, but is signing off and cooperating with Kenya when it comes [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  to Haiti. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=80.96s)]
*  So security and economies are cooperating with each other, including investment in a [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=82.1s)]
*  lot of Kenyan companies. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  You know, Kenya is powered by a lot of renewable energy as well. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we saw the discussion about U.S. tech and investment in Kenya, as well as the African [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=92.24s)]
*  continent more broadly, to try and especially focus on green growth and technological advancements [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=99.32s)]
*  that are particularly tied towards climate change and helping to take better care of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=106.55999999999999s)]
*  the environment. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=113.56s)]
*  And that was one of the things that we certainly heard from President Ruto talking about extreme [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=115.0s)]
*  climate, the problems that that creates for his country as well as other nations around [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=119.32s)]
*  the world. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  And he also was talking about the importance. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  You mentioned, Errol, Haiti. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=129.12s)]
*  And we heard questions, multiple questions about the responsibility to try and help out [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=131.84s)]
*  with the gang situation in Haiti. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=139.04s)]
*  And we heard President Ruto say that it is the collective responsibility of all nations [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=141.08s)]
*  to try and assist in instances like that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=146.8s)]
*  CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes was among the reporters there trying [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=149.16s)]
*  to get a question in, in that space before the two leaders left the stage. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=153.28s)]
*  Nancy, I'm wondering what stood out you most about what President Biden did and did not [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=157.0s)]
*  say. I know he was also pressed on the ICC warrant, Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=161.6s)]
*  But what jumped out at you most? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=166.12s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  The geopolitical ramifications of Kenya's decision to send one thousand peacekeeping [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=170.2s)]
*  forces halfway around the world to the Western Hemisphere to help with unrest in Haiti. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=176.76s)]
*  Both President Biden and President Ruto got a lot of questions about that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  President Biden was asked why the U.S. wasn't committing troops when Haiti is in our own [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  backyard, so to speak. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=193.72s)]
*  And President Ruto got questions about why Kenya was willing to send troops halfway around [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  the world when there is a great deal of unrest on the African continent. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  President Biden interestingly said that the U.S. made a very deliberate decision not to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=206.32s)]
*  send U.S. peacekeeping forces to Haiti to help deal with the gang problem there, the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=211.04s)]
*  violence there, because we didn't want to look like the biggest superpower in the hemisphere [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=218.0s)]
*  just stepping in once again to exert our will. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=224.12s)]
*  And so he basically went looking around the world for other countries that were willing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=227.92s)]
*  to step in. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=232.6s)]
*  And Kenya, he said, answered the call. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=233.6s)]
*  Yeah. And on that front, Nancy, sort of a similar question, the parallel. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=235.52s)]
*  Did we hear anything in particular that stood out to you from from President Ruto's remark? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=240.6s)]
*  It seemed like at one point he was trying to really establish himself as independent [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  of President Biden in the United States, despite being such close allies. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=251.28s)]
*  Yes, he was challenged particularly by the Kenyan reporters here in the room about why [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=256.12s)]
*  he was sending these troops around the world. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=261.48s)]
*  They pointed out that there are schools in Kenya that have had to close because of violence [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=264.12s)]
*  there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=268.56s)]
*  They said, you know, we don't have a lot of police officers to spare. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=269.56s)]
*  What exactly is the goal here? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=272.36s)]
*  Are you simply doing the bidding of the U.S.? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=274.8s)]
*  And so he asserted himself said, no, we're making our own decision. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=277.16s)]
*  This is a strategic decision. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  We are working to to combat unrest, not just in Haiti, but but in the Congo, in Somalia. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=282.88000000000005s)]
*  And now, you know, we want to help out people around the world. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  This is something that Kenya has been doing, he said, for decades, even as he insisted [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=294.72s)]
*  that they are continuing to work on their own problems at home. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=300.5s)]
*  And of course, Nancy, this is part of a multi day state visit. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=303.76000000000005s)]
*  The two leaders met one on one today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=308.24s)]
*  They had this joint presser now. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=309.8s)]
*  What else can we expect as this continues and wraps up by the end of the week? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=312.0s)]
*  Well, this is the first state visit, as you probably mentioned, Errol, for an African [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=316.88000000000005s)]
*  leader in 15 years. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=323.8s)]
*  So it's been a long time coming. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=326.44000000000005s)]
*  And a state visit, of course, means that all of the bells and whistles come out here at [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=329.0s)]
*  the White House. There will be a state dinner this evening. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  It will take place in a glass pavilion with a thousand candles out on the White House [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  lawn. There will be performances by Brad Paisley, by the Howard University Gospel Choir, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  because President Ruto and his wife, we're told, are big fans of country and gospel [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  music. This is the U.S. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  using all of the trappings to build relationships, strengthen relationships with a key [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=357.12s)]
*  leader in Kenya. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=364.64s)]
*  President Biden said a short time ago that he was designating Kenya as a non-NATO U.S., [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=366.2s)]
*  major U.S. ally. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=374.12s)]
*  And that does not happen very often. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=376.2s)]
*  This is the first U.S. ally in sub-Saharan Africa to to gain that designation. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=378.08s)]
*  And it's all about sort of countering Chinese and Russian influence in Africa. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=384.16s)]
*  And even President Ruto acknowledged that the U.S. has some work to do on that front. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=390.88s)]
*  He said something very interesting in this press conference. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=396.36s)]
*  He said that the that the U.S. has an opportunity to radically recalibrate its influence [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  in Africa, an acknowledgment that that the U.S. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=407.48s)]
*  fell behind these other nations and now needs to catch up. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=411.96000000000004s)]
*  President Biden said that the U.S. would be stepping up its its investment, making more [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  loans and working on on on grant forgiveness for these debt-saddled nations in Africa. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=421.8s)]
*  He even gave that effort a label. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=430.16s)]
*  He called it the Nairobi-Washington vision. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=432.72s)]
*  The White House has been arguing that China saddled some of these developing nations with [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=436.68s)]
*  high interest loans that that drove up their debt and that the U.S. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=442.48s)]
*  is now going to step help step in and help them get out from under that debt. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=447.12s)]
*  That's a really interesting way that these greater geopolitical battles are are finding [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=452.04s)]
*  almost these proxy battles on the African continent, especially just earlier this year [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=460.52s)]
*  with Niger switching its alliance from the United States to Russia and China. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=465.88s)]
*  And given that we've seen Russia and China really ramping up their efforts to increase [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=470.8s)]
*  their influence in Africa, I'm wondering, Nancy, if you can talk to us just a little [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=474.88s)]
*  bit more about the importance that Kenya in particular plays in trying to shape the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=479.04s)]
*  relationship that the African continent and President Rudeau and his and his other fellow [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=486.12s)]
*  presidents of African nations have in terms of that larger picture. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=492.36s)]
*  Right. Well, Kenya is a democracy. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=496.96s)]
*  That's important. It's a longtime ally of the United States with a long relationship. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=498.76s)]
*  President Biden highlighted that 60 year relationship today and it is in sub-Saharan [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=505.28s)]
*  Africa. And in a year in which we've seen unrest in several different African nations, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=512.24s)]
*  unrest that actually prevented the president from going to Africa this year as he promised he [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=518.5999999999999s)]
*  would now says he's going to do it next year. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=523.7199999999999s)]
*  Kenya has been a more or less a beacon, a stable ally in that region. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=526.52s)]
*  And President Biden noted today, for example, when we were talking about Haiti, he said, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=533.56s)]
*  not only is the U.S. not stepping in in Haiti and turning to Kenya because the U.S. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouiKr4ahso&t=539.8399999999999s)]
