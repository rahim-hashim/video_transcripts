# Hamas political spokesman gives combative interview to CBS News
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM)
*  We go now to Imtiaz Tayyip, who interviewed the political spokesman for Hamas yesterday. Imtiaz? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, Margaret, as you can imagine, this was a challenging and often combative interview with Dr. Ghazi Hamad, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=7.0s)]
*  a spokesman for Hamas and senior member of its political bureau. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=13.0s)]
*  Now, Dr. Hamad denied Hamas received any outside support for its attack on Israel, including from Iran, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=17.0s)]
*  which contradicts earlier statements to the BBC that it did. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=24.0s)]
*  Did you receive support from outside? Did you receive support from Iran? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=28.0s)]
*  No, no. It is just a decision taken by Hamas only. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=32.0s)]
*  You received no support from any country outside of Gaza? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=35.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, never. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=39.0s)]
*  Now, he also denied Hamas fighters deliberately targeted civilians, saying their target was only the Israeli military [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=41.0s)]
*  and Israeli military infrastructure, something we, of course, challenged them on, given the vast amount of video evidence [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=48.0s)]
*  of Hamas fighters shooting at civilians in civilian areas. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=54.0s)]
*  Now, as for why Hamas carried out such a brazen and brutal attack inside Israel, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=59.0s)]
*  Dr. Hamad blamed successive Israeli governments for refusing to end the now decades-long occupation of the Palestinian territories. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=64.0s)]
*  He said Israel's current government, which is often described as extreme far right, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=72.0s)]
*  has pursued an agenda of such harsh and punitive measures against Palestinians, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=76.0s)]
*  which is why he says Hamas carried out the devastating attack, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=81.0s)]
*  an attack which, of course, has resulted in Gaza being bombed like never before, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=85.0s)]
*  and a death toll there that already exceeds the four previous wars, something he blamed squarely on Israel, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=90.0s)]
*  but he would not take any responsibility for the Hamas attack being the trigger for this extraordinary violence. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=96.0s)]
*  Now, when questioned about the dozens of hostages abducted by Hamas fighters [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=103.0s)]
*  and still being held captive inside Gaza, including some Americans, here's what he said. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=107.0s)]
*  Why don't you just release the people who are abducted? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=114.0s)]
*  Okay, we want, first of all, we want to stop this daily death in Gaza, daily killing in Gaza. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=117.0s)]
*  It is our priority now. Your priority should be how to stop killing, and this is genocide in Gaza. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=122.0s)]
*  It is really genocide in Gaza. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=130.0s)]
*  And you hear that even international ridiculous, all international organizations, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=133.0s)]
*  all of them say that situation in Gaza is catastrophic, is big disaster. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=141.0s)]
*  We have to stop this. Maybe after that we can talk about anything. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=146.0s)]
*  Thank you. M.T.S. Tayyab in Jerusalem. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQZbFJnYiM&t=150.0s)]
