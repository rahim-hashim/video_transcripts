# U.S. troops bolster NATO allies bordering Ukraine
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg)
*  There are currently 100,000 U.S. troops supporting NATO allies in European countries that surround Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=0.0s)]
*  Our Charlie Dagata spent time with some in Constantia, Romania. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=6.44s)]
*  The screaming eagles have landed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=10.44s)]
*  The 101st Airborne Division deployed on the very edge of NATO territory. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=15.44s)]
*  Go, go, go, go! [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=20.0s)]
*  With Colonel Edwin Mathias and Brigadier General John Lubas, we board Black Hawk helicopters and head toward the border with Ukraine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=22.0s)]
*  Specifically trained to hit the ground fighting, when the call came, the colonel said his soldiers were ready. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=29.84s)]
*  You can see it on their face that all that stuff we talked about, about being ready, about training hard, not leaving anything on the table. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=36.84s)]
*  They had a chance to put it into use and they're doing that same stuff here today. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=43.84s)]
*  It just got real. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=46.84s)]
*  It did. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=48.84s)]
*  We traversed the Black Sea coast across the water from Russian-held territory in Ukraine and Crimea until we reached the forward operating site, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=49.84s)]
*  where soon U.S. and Romanian NATO forces were conducting a joint air and ground assault. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=59.84s)]
*  Live fire tank and artillery rounds took aim at targets simulating the battlefields of Ukraine. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=66.84s)]
*  This isn't a routine military exercise against a hypothetical enemy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=74.84s)]
*  This is a real-life combat scenario against a very real enemy, one that's not so far away. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=79.84s)]
*  We're about 250 miles from the front line of Russian troops. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=87.84s)]
*  And the way we are dispersed right now, we are ready to transition from our current locations where we're currently at to combat operations on order. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=91.84s)]
*  It's the first time the 101st has been headquartered in Europe since the D-Day landings, seen here with then-General Dwight Eisenhower, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=100.84s)]
*  prepared to defend European allies again if called upon to fight. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=110.84s)]
*  Now, almost 80 years later, the 101st is back, making a mark in history once more. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=115.84s)]
*  Those military exercises come at a time when broader NATO nuclear exercises are underway, now entering the second week. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=125.84s)]
*  They involve 60 aircraft from 14 countries, including U.S. B-52 bombers. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=133.84s)]
*  They were scheduled long before the war in Ukraine began. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=139.84s)]
*  Margaret? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=143.84s)]
*  Charlie Dagata, thank you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ZhqejtWg&t=144.84s)]
