*  Since then Israel has been waging a war on multiple fronts in Gaza, which is now in near total ruins [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=16.6s)]
*  over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed mainly women and children [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=24.68s)]

*  Israel's war with Hamas shows no sign of letting up [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=36.24s)]
*  While in the West Bank Israeli forces have carried out massive raids across the occupied territory [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=40.36s)]
*  Well, we're here in one of several villages in the Israeli occupied West Bank Palestinian villages where the situation is extremely [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=45.96s)]
*  Tense following Israel's decision to launch what's being described as one of the largest operations [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=54.12s)]
*  It's conducted here in the West Bank in decades [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=60.519999999999996s)]

*  Following the wave of booby-trap pager explosions targeting Hezbollah members [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=79.28s)]
*  Then the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah just over a week ago [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=84.2s)]
*  triggering violence that seen more than 1.2 million people displaced and over [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=89.36s)]
*  2,000 killed this was once a five-story building and it's pretty much all but obliterate [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=94.56s)]
*  Okay, we don't know exactly what that was that clearly a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=102.8s)]
*  Very loud strike in the distance and it really just underscores the situation across southern Beirut as Israel [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  continues to strike it heavily [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=115.84s)]

*  Who showed us the pet birds he couldn't bear to leave behind? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=125.08s)]
*  A rocket fell so close to us he says you must have been so scared [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=128.52s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhxTfivgco&t=132.88000000000002s)]
