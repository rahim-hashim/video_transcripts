# Bethlehem marks another quiet Christmas as Middle East conflicts take a toll on tourism, economy
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM)
*  Well, one of the holiest places on earth at Christmas time is Bethlehem, the historical [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=0.0s)]
*  birthplace of Jesus Christ located in the occupied West Bank. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=5.3s)]
*  And normally it's a festive time with Christian pilgrims packing the streets and shops, but [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=9.48s)]
*  of course not this year. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=13.48s)]
*  The ongoing conflicts in the region have taken a toll on the tourism and on the local economy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=15.34s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent MTS Tayyab is in Bethlehem where he spoke with shopkeepers [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=20.44s)]
*  whose stores are empty this year. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=25.16s)]
*  Well, normally this would be the most wonderful time of year here in Bethlehem. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=28.64s)]
*  But with Israel's war in Gaza now in its 15th month, few from this most ancient of Christian [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=32.52s)]
*  communities feels like celebrating Christmas as the city's tourism dependent economy also [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=38.84s)]
*  now faces collapse. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=44.36s)]
*  Now, we've been speaking to people here who have been running shops, some of their families [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=45.56s)]
*  for generations saying that they have made absolutely no money over the past two years. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=50.6s)]
*  Many of them saying that they're not sure if their businesses will be able to stay afloat. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=57.48s)]
*  Now when you consider the fact that on average you would normally have around two million [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=62.64s)]
*  Christians and pilgrims and other tourists passing through this holy city, you can imagine [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=68.16s)]
*  that the fact that they've had very little tourism since October 7th of 2023, that it's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=74.28s)]
*  been quite painful for them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=80.56s)]
*  But equally, of course, it pain for them, if not more, is the situation that's unfolding [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=82.12s)]
*  in Gaza, where over 45,000 Palestinians have been killed. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=87.72s)]
*  And of course, there is a small Christian population there as well. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=91.92s)]
*  Now, you may be able to see the small entrance to the Church of the Nativity behind me. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  This is known as the door of humility, and it's a symbol that all people are equal. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  And for so many Palestinian Christians here in Bethlehem, all people should also be able [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  to live in peace. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  Michael. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=112.28s)]
*  MTS, Tybe in Bethlehem, thanks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF7WZ9d6ZM&t=113.28s)]
