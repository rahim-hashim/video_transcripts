# Margaret Brennan unpacks JD Vance's remarks at Munich Security Conference
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY)
*  If there were any doubts among America's European allies that there's a new sheriff in town, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=0.0s)]
*  they were erased today when Vice President J.D. Vance said those exact words in his first [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=5.08s)]
*  major speech on the world state. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=10.38s)]
*  At the Munich Security Conference, where much of the focus is on the Russian invasion of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=12.82s)]
*  Ukraine, Vance lectured European politicians about free speech, immigration, and the need [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=17.68s)]
*  for cooperation with the far right. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Many downplayed the threat of the strategic alliance between U.S. adversaries Russia and China. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=25.54s)]
*  The threat that I worry the most about vis-Ã -vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=33.44s)]
*  not any other external actor. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=39.08s)]
*  And what I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=41.82s)]
*  its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=48.44s)]
*  And we are joined now by Margaret Brennan in Washington. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=53.32s)]
*  OK, that's what J.D. Vance is worried about, Margaret. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=55.82s)]
*  How do the Europeans receive that, and how does that affect U.S. national interests in [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=59.18s)]
*  this tight moment? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=63.5s)]
*  Well, it sounded to a lot of these allies of the United States like they were being [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=64.84s)]
*  described as adversaries or autocrats. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=69.64s)]
*  It was really the focus here, two things. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=73.06s)]
*  One of them was migration, and the second was what Vice President Vance calls censorship. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=76.18s)]
*  He was trying to bring that MAGA message of the enemy within to the global stage. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=82.64s)]
*  And specifically, he says that European leaders aren't showing that they have strong democracies [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  when they sideline controversial groups. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=93.24s)]
*  He went out of his way to meet with the head of the AfD, that's a political party that's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=95.41999999999999s)]
*  under investigation in Germany, because it's so far right and for potentially conducting [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=99.66s)]
*  extremism. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=106.22s)]
*  And he mentioned that car ramming in Munich recently conducted by an Afghan migrant as [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=107.22s)]
*  an example of what he says is out of control migration. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=112.24s)]
*  He says that's proof you've got to bring immigration skeptics into the government. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  Margaret, he also met with Zelensky. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  How did that meeting go? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, Maurice, there are no diplomatic talks yet underway to actually end the war [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=123.28s)]
*  between Ukraine and Russia, though there's a promise to try to get there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=129.32s)]
*  What we saw today was the president of Ukraine meeting with the U.S. and talking about a [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  joint venture, an investment in critical rare earth minerals. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=139.04s)]
*  These are the things you can use in electronics. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=144.16s)]
*  President Trump is trying to shore that up in order to sort of have it as a reward for [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=147.18s)]
*  all the billions of dollars in weapons the U.S. has provided. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=153.0s)]
*  Okay, Margaret Brennan there in D.C., thank you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=155.72s)]
*  Margaret, we'll be along Sunday with Face the News. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suqw2wpmLeY&t=158.04s)]
