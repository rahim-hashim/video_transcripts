# How Trump's inauguration is playing into the World Economic Forum
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=0.0s)]
*  Government leaders and business leaders from around the globe [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=2.0s)]
*  are currently gathering in Davos, Switzerland, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=5.0s)]
*  for the World Economic Forum's annual multi-day meeting. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=7.0s)]
*  What world leaders are sure to discuss this week, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=11.0s)]
*  newly inaugurated President Trump beginning his second term. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=14.0s)]
*  Ravi Agrawal is in Davos covering the World Economic Forum meeting. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=18.0s)]
*  He's doing so because he's an editor-in-chief of Foreign Policy magazine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=22.0s)]
*  Ravi, good to see you. Always a pleasure. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=26.0s)]
*  Any talk so far about Trump 2.0 beginning yesterday going into his second day? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=28.0s)]
*  Any talk. I mean, it's all the talk. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=35.0s)]
*  I think it's rare that Davos is overshadowed by something else [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=37.0s)]
*  other than what's going on here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=42.0s)]
*  And this is certainly one year where a lot of the attention is actually on Washington, D.C. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=44.0s)]
*  As Trump was speaking, as he was taking the oath of office yesterday, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=49.0s)]
*  a lot of people, I was around CEOs, leaders, were anxiously checking in, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=54.0s)]
*  looking at clips, trying to get a sense of what he might focus on. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=60.0s)]
*  Obviously here in Davos, in Switzerland, there are a lot of European leaders in attendance. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=65.0s)]
*  They're very worried about tariffs. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=71.0s)]
*  There are leaders from other parts of the world who have other concerns about Trump's global agenda. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=73.0s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, is here as well, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=80.0s)]
*  also closely watching how Trump might change America's Ukraine policy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=84.0s)]
*  But really, in many ways, people are watching with bated breath [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=90.0s)]
*  to see if Trump's bite is going to be as bad in some senses as his bark on a lot of issues they care about. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=94.0s)]
*  And, Ravi, to what degree is the conversation touching on things [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=103.0s)]
*  like what President Trump has said about Greenland or about the Panama Canal [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=108.0s)]
*  or something that seems fanciful here but may not be read as fanciful in Davos, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=113.0s)]
*  renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=120.0s)]
*  So I think a lot of people now, the types of people who come here, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=124.0s)]
*  they've learned to take Trump seriously. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=131.0s)]
*  And they want to be ready. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=134.0s)]
*  So they have come out with strong statements, for example, on his comments about Greenland. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=137.0s)]
*  Similarly, the Canadians have come out with very strong statements. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=143.0s)]
*  Christopher Rieland, the former finance minister, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=147.0s)]
*  wrote a great piece in the Washington Post about why Canada should oppose it [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=150.0s)]
*  and how Canada could make other friends if it needed to. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=156.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of deterrence in that people know that Trump often trial balloons ideas. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=159.0s)]
*  Sometimes his statements are negotiating tactics. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=167.0s)]
*  I will say, though, that one thing that has changed from now, between now and, say, 2017, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=172.0s)]
*  is that a lot of leaders around the world have cottoned on to what works with Trump, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=179.0s)]
*  whether it's flattery, whether it is a sense that if he is transactional, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=186.0s)]
*  then they, too, can be transactional in response to try to appeal to his quid pro quo nature [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=191.0s)]
*  or his smell for a deal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=198.0s)]
*  They've understood that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=200.0s)]
*  They've understood also that if you want to get in with Trump world, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=201.0s)]
*  you could try to appeal to family members. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=205.0s)]
*  They see Trump world as being run like a family business, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=208.0s)]
*  which is not uncommon in many parts of the world. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=212.0s)]
*  So people are cottoning on to how to deal with Trump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=215.0s)]
*  And, of course, he's mercurial, so he may know that and react in kind. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=219.0s)]
*  Robbie, the politics of our current time, not just in America, but in Europe [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=224.0s)]
*  and other parts of the world, disdain, if not disregard, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=229.0s)]
*  the international institutions built after the end of World War II [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=233.0s)]
*  and all the way through the Cold War. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=237.0s)]
*  And there have been editorial cartoons and op-eds written about basically Russia, China, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=239.0s)]
*  and the United States carving up the world to their own selfish self-interest. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=243.0s)]
*  Is that a topic there? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=249.0s)]
*  It is, and I'll tell you why. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=252.0s)]
*  For the last three, four decades, there was a term called Davos Man, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=254.0s)]
*  which became very popular, and that term was coined by Samuel Huntington, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=260.0s)]
*  who founded the magazine I now work for, Foreign Policy. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=264.0s)]
*  And Davos Man was meant to depict a sort of a caricature of a global elitist [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=268.0s)]
*  who comes here to Davos, is in a very global fashion, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=276.0s)]
*  thinks that boundaries don't matter, that national loyalty doesn't matter. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=281.0s)]
*  And that was very much the typical Davos attendee who believed in more globalization, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=286.0s)]
*  more free trade, more coming together, that that would solve all problems. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=291.0s)]
*  And it's very clear now that a strain of leaders around the world feel that that failed. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=296.0s)]
*  It didn't work out. More globalization didn't fix every single problem. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=302.0s)]
*  And the answer then is protectionism, nationalism, populism, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=306.0s)]
*  the forces that Trump is now known for, but so are many other leaders around the world. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=310.0s)]
*  In Europe, Viktor Orban in Hungary, for example, Millet in Argentina, many others. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=315.0s)]
*  And that kind of spells, to a degree, the end of the original Davos Man, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=321.0s)]
*  which a lot of people here are concerned about. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=327.0s)]
*  However, Major, if you look at how closely CEOs have seemed to align themselves to Trump, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=330.0s)]
*  not only in the last couple of months, but also just yesterday at the inauguration, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=338.0s)]
*  then there is a clear sense that maybe business leaders are out to do business [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=342.0s)]
*  and they will do what it takes to get good deals for themselves. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=347.0s)]
*  Whether it means a knee-jerk reaction to anything from DEI to borders or free trade, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=351.0s)]
*  they will go with the flow. That's where we are now. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=359.0s)]
*  Would you say, based on conversations there in Davos, Ravi, that there is an anticipation [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=362.0s)]
*  12 months from now, the next time Davos convenes, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=368.0s)]
*  there will be something approximating a full-blown global trade war, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=371.0s)]
*  fought largely through tariffs? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=375.0s)]
*  Possibly. I think it is a major risk factor that a lot of CEOs cite. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=378.0s)]
*  They are very worried about their supply chains. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=385.0s)]
*  Remember, a lot of the CEOs here run big global firms, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=388.0s)]
*  so their supply chains are mired in every country. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=392.0s)]
*  They get components and components of components from a dizzying array of places, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=396.0s)]
*  and they worry a lot about tariffs and the impact that could have on their bottom lines. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=401.0s)]
*  That said, CEOs are aware as well that Trump is remarkably sensitive to the markets. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=406.0s)]
*  He wants to see the stock markets do well. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=415.0s)]
*  He wants to be liked and admired by the business community. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=417.0s)]
*  Inasmuch as CEOs here at Davos are very aware that Trump has a dramatic impact on them, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=421.0s)]
*  they also realize that they have a lever that they could exercise over him. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=427.0s)]
*  They can lobby, and the markets matter to this White House. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=434.0s)]
*  It will be very interesting to see the tussle between business and government, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=438.0s)]
*  between money and power, who ends up winning out. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=443.0s)]
*  Ravi Agrawal, editor-in-chief, Foreign Policy Magazine. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=447.0s)]
*  Always a pleasure to hear. Thank you so much. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=450.0s)]
*  Pleasure. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapvlAfAp8I&t=452.0s)]
