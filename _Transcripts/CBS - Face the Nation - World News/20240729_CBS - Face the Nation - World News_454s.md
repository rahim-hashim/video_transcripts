# 2 children killed in U.K. stabbing attack at Taylor Swift-themed dance event
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ)
*  Thanks for joining us here on CBS News 24 seven. We're following a tragic and developing story overseas police have arrested a 17 year old accused of stabbing at least eight people in northwest England. Many of the victims are children. Police say they were called to an address in Southport north of Liverpool. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Just around noon local time, they say the violence scene unfolded near a yoga and dance studio where a Taylor Swift event for Children ages 6 to 11 was taking place. We want to take you now to the UK where authorities are giving an update on this attack. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=17.0s)]
*  The police arrived at the address in Southport on the morning of October 14th, 2017. Police say they were called to an address in Southport north of Liverpool. When they arrived, they were shocked to find that multiple people, many of whom were children, had been subjected to a ferocious attack and had suffered serious injuries. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=62.0s)]
*  It is understood that the Children were attending a Taylor Swift event at a dance school when the offender armed with a knife walked into the premises and started to attack inside the Children. We believe that the adults who were injured were bravely trying to protect the Children who were being attacked. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=78.0s)]
*  As a mum and a nana, I can't begin to imagine the pain and suffering that the families of the victims are going through at this moment in time and I wish to send my heartfelt condolences to them. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=97.0s)]
*  Our specialist family liaison officers are providing support to the families of the deceased Children and the Children who were injured at this moment in time. We will be working with our partners, including Sefton Council, to provide that wider trauma support to those who have been affected by this incident. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=112.0s)]
*  The investigation is in its early stages and the motivation for the incident remains unclear. However, counter-terrorism police north-west have offered their support to Merseyside Police as the full circumstances of what has happened are being established. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=131.0s)]
*  At this moment in time, the investigation is not being treated as terrorist related. I would appeal to anyone who has witnessed anything or who has information that could help us the investigation to contact us on Crimestoppers 0800 555 111. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=147.0s)]

*  On behalf of Safe Kitchen and on behalf of the North West Ambulance Service, we would like to offer our sincere condolences to those families who have tragically lost loved ones today and to the wider community. Our thoughts are with you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=196.0s)]
*  I can confirm that we were called to the Heart Street area in Southport just before lunchtime today to an incident of reported multiple stabbings. We declared this as a major incident due to the number of casualties and the types of injuries sustained. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=209.0s)]
*  A substantial number of ambulances and specialised resources were dispatched to the scene, including our hazardous area response team, air ambulances and merit doctors. Tragically, we can confirm that two lives have sadly been cut short. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=222.0s)]
*  We treated 11 casualties on scene who were conveyed by emergency ambulance and heli-med to Alderhay Hospital, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, along with Aintree University, Southport Formby and Orangecoke General Hospitals. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=239.0s)]
*  I would like to thank our staff who worked incredibly hard caring for the victims in what was a devastating scene. I would also like to thank our Blue Lights and emergency colleagues from the NHS, the wider NHS, for all their support during this incident. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=257.0s)]
*  And again, we'd like to express our deepest sympathies to the loved ones of those affected. No doubt this incident will have a lasting impact on the whole community and our thoughts are very much with them at this difficult time. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=275.0s)]
*  Phil Garraghan, Chief Fire Officer for the Emergency Side Fire and Rescue Service. I'm a colleague, so I would like to pass on my thoughts and those on my service to the family, friends and loved ones of everyone affected by this horrific incident. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=288.0s)]
*  This is not something that anyone should have to come to terms with. In relation to the incident itself, my firefighters responded following the declaration of a major incident and were on the scene in minutes. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=303.0s)]
*  With crews from Southport Fire Station and a specialist team from Aintree responding to assist our colleagues from Merseyside Police and North West Ambulance Service who were dealing with a traumatic and understandably chaotic scene. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=316.0s)]
*  The crews who were trauma trained worked alongside their colleagues to provide trauma care, administer first aid and undertake a wide area search for any other persons affected by this incident. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=330.0s)]
*  My firefighters, many of whom live in this community, will be appalled by this act, but they will be back on the streets of Southport tomorrow to provide reassurance, kindness and support. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=343.0s)]
*  The crews themselves were stood down at 4.18pm this afternoon. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=356.0s)]
*  Well, we have been listening to such a tragic update from officials in the UK addressing the violent act that happened at a dance class for children today. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=361.0s)]
*  We're showing you a map right now of where this took place in Southport. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=381.0s)]
*  They say that a 17-year-old is now arrested, a 17-year-old male on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=385.0s)]
*  After he stabbed several people, according to our partners BBC News, officials said that unfortunately and tragically two children have died. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=392.0s)]
*  Nine others have been injured. Six are in critical condition. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=403.0s)]
*  Two adults are in critical condition, officials saying we heard there that they were injured. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=407.0s)]
*  They believe trying to protect the children. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=412.0s)]
*  Again, this was at a dance school in which there was a Taylor Swift themed event for school-age children. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=415.0s)]
*  The man armed with a knife walked in and started stabbing. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=424.0s)]
*  While they say this is not being investigated as a terror incident, that right now the motive is unclear. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=428.0s)]
*  This Taylor Swift yoga and dance workshop was aimed at children between the ages of 7 and 12 with just tragically two of the children being killed in this. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=436.0s)]
*  We will of course continue to monitor updates. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PbJ3aBt3ZQ&t=448.0s)]
