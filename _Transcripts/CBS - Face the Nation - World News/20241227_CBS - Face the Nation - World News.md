# What is the state of Trump’s relationship with Canada’s Justin Trudeau?
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4)
*  For the big story this afternoon, members of President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=0.0s)]
*  set to meet with a pair of top Canadian officials in Florida as Trump continues to mock the country's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Prime Minister. Trump aides will meet with Canada's foreign affairs minister and newly sworn-in finance [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=9.84s)]
*  minister who has only been on that job for a week and a half now. Now Trump did host Prime Minister [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=15.52s)]
*  Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago last month and if you remember that came after the President-elect threatened to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=21.12s)]
*  impose a 25% tariff on Canadian goods. CBS News political reporter Torian Small joins us now with [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=26.72s)]
*  Morin Torian. That tariff threat it is top of mind for many. Do we expect that to come up during these [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=33.2s)]
*  talks and what else could be up for discussion here? Well Rick if this is any indication [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=39.28s)]
*  Dominic LeBlanc is one of the top cabinet members who are meeting with the President this week. He [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=46.08s)]
*  replaces Christina Freeland. She was the former finance minister of Canada. She resigned about a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=52.32s)]
*  week ago over disagreements with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's approach to addressing Donald [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=58.88s)]
*  Trump's tariff threat. So this will be a through line as these conversations happen. We also know [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=66.88s)]
*  that LeBlanc said he's expecting to meet with Tom Homan. That's Trump pick for the next border czar [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  as Trump has telegraphed that he wants to address Canada's role in the illegal trafficking of fentanyl [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  and other illicit drugs and illegal immigration across the northern border. But we know that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=86.55999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump has approached this more aggressive foreign relation style before. He's the man who [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  coveted the art of the deal right? So he knows that approaching it from a more aggressive style [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=100.08s)]
*  may yield better results for him. I should also mention that he was able to renegotiate the North [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=106.0s)]
*  American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA which then we saw toward the end of his term then be transformed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=112.08s)]
*  into the US Mexico Canada Agreement. So when it comes to trade this has been a bullish style that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=119.28s)]
*  has worked out for him and he's looking to pick that up in the second term as well. And Torian [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  this brings up the question now where does the relationship between Trump and Trudeau stand ahead [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=129.12s)]
*  of the inauguration? I think a lot of people want to know. Yeah Rick they've had an icy relationship [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=133.44s)]
*  for quite a bit and I would imagine trolling from his social media page has done nothing to thaw it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=139.92s)]
*  He called Justin Trudeau the governor of the 51st state of the United States. He said that voters [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  there should elect Wayne Gretzky NHL hockey legend to replace him as prime minister. So he's had this [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=152.24s)]
*  not so settling relationship with Trudeau for a while now although Trudeau like you said has been [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=161.04s)]
*  to Mar-a-Lago since Trump has clinched the election. It doesn't look like their relationship is getting [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=166.64s)]
*  any better anytime soon. So look you remember a couple of days ago we saw tech companies line [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=171.84s)]
*  up to fund Trump's inauguration. Trump also posted on true social today claiming Microsoft founder [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=176.56s)]
*  Bill Gates now has asked to come to Mar-a-Lago. So what do we know about this and how have we seen [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=182.72s)]
*  tech leaders embrace the president-elect? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=187.68s)]
*  Well Rick this one's actually pretty bizarre. So Donald Trump posted to his social media page that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  Bill Gates said that he wanted to come visit him. He said that he missed him and he missed X. So I'm [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=197.84s)]
*  not sure if he confused or maybe conflated Elon Musk with Bill Gates but it wouldn't be unsurprising [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  that Gates like other tech billionaires and entrepreneurs are lining up to meet with the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  president Mark Zuckerberg of Metta, formerly of the company known as Facebook, also met with [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=213.92s)]
*  President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in November. So it looks like more tech billionaires are on board to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=220.16s)]
*  at least opening the dialogue and having a less than hostile relationship. I should also mention [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  that JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and VP-elect has a background as a venture capitalist [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=229.92s)]
*  in Silicon Valley so he knows those Californian contacts and makes sense now that they're tying [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=235.27999999999997s)]
*  them into the phone as we approach Trump's next administration. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=240.16s)]
*  That's a good point. It'll be interesting to see how it all plays out. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=243.2s)]
*  Torian Small live from West Palm Beach Florida for us. Torian thank you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iHNIhkZ_4&t=246.07999999999998s)]
