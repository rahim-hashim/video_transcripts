# Poland's Duda is latest world leader to meet with Trump
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ)
*  Turning now to the intersection of campaign politics and national security, Poland's President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Duda became the latest world leader to meet with former President Trump in a two-and-a-half-hour [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=5.28s)]
*  meeting last night. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=10.68s)]
*  It was their first meeting since 2017, when Mr. Trump traveled to Poland and met with [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=12.1s)]
*  Duda in Warsaw. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=17.2s)]
*  CBS News faced the nation moderator and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=18.8s)]
*  joins us now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=23.1s)]
*  And, Margaret, you were actually on that 2017 trip. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=24.1s)]
*  Margaret, in terms of the meeting last night, what came out of it? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=26.7s)]
*  Well, we know from the Polish president, President Duda's public statements that they did discuss [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=30.3s)]
*  the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=35.76s)]
*  And, in fact, according to President Duda, Mr. Trump asked his opinion, along with some [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=36.76s)]
*  specifics on NATO. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=43.3s)]
*  And that's interesting, because for all of the criticism of the Duda government in terms [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=45.2s)]
*  in terms of him running twice on an anti-gay platform, he is staunchly anti-Russia. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=51.34s)]
*  So in terms of a persuasive voice on the Ukraine issue, he might be able to get through to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Trump, because President Duda, I was just looking back at my notes, it was back in 2019 [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=66.02000000000001s)]
*  that Trump and Duda had come to this agreement to rotate U.S. troops out of Germany and into [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  Poland to be a buttress against Russia. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=79.66s)]
*  They, in fact, said they were going to call it Fort Trump. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=81.89999999999999s)]
*  That project never actually happened. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  There were some different disagreements over how to execute it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=88.66s)]
*  That renaming didn't happen, though U.S. troops do rotate in to Poland. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=91.3s)]
*  But President Duda refers to those four years as significantly strengthening the Polish [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=96.69999999999999s)]
*  government and Polish security. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=102.78s)]
*  So he has a very different view and characterization of what those four years of the Trump administration [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=105.02s)]
*  were about in terms of Ukraine and Russia. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=109.66000000000001s)]
*  But when it comes to where we are now, the conservative politics of Duda are where the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=112.9s)]
*  Biden administration has problems with him, that anti-gay agenda. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  They have largely put aside some of those public criticisms of him of late because he's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=122.86s)]
*  on their side when it comes to standing up to Vladimir Putin and being pro-NATO. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=127.94s)]
*  Yeah, it definitely sounds like a delicate balancing act there. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=132.46s)]
*  But in terms of some of these foreign governments that are taking meetings with the former president, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=135.82s)]
*  why are they doing this in the middle of a presidential campaign? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=141.7s)]
*  Well, it's hard here when we say, you know, there's only one president at a time and you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=145.7s)]
*  don't want to complicate the politics within the parties. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=150.66s)]
*  The counter to that, for example, from the government of the United Kingdom, a U.S. ally, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=154.74s)]
*  was it is standard to meet with opposition leaders. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=159.82s)]
*  And that is part of a democracy and that is part of prudent planning. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=163.45999999999998s)]
*  And David Cameron, the foreign secretary now, the former prime minister, went down to Mar-a-Lago [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=167.5s)]
*  and held this meeting with Mr. Trump. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=173.38s)]
*  Part of that, the U.K. government would argue, was strategic to talk to him about issues [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=175.44s)]
*  like Ukraine because Mr. Trump, even out of office, is hugely influential in the conservative [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=180.38s)]
*  movement. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  We see this in our own polling. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  In the CBS News poll, 79 percent of self-described Republicans cite Mr. Trump as the most trusted [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=188.5s)]
*  source of information on Russia and Ukraine, more than the Pentagon. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=195.34s)]
*  I mean, why is that? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=198.94s)]
*  It is we are now in, I mean, this is a whole other, we could talk for an hour about the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=201.58s)]
*  weaponization of information distrust in journalists like us, distrust in media institutions. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=205.06s)]
*  The wearing away of trust in our institutions is broadly an issue, not just in our democracy, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=210.54000000000002s)]
*  but in many places. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=215.62s)]
*  But that's pretty incredible that he is that much of a thought leader. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=217.54s)]
*  By the way, it would help out Speaker Mike Johnson quite a lot if Mr. Trump came out [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=220.7s)]
*  and endorsed that Ukraine aid bill, which he hasn't done. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=225.14s)]
*  And that has complicated the politics of the party. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=228.62s)]
*  But back to your question about the leaders and who's going for meetings, when it becomes [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=231.18s)]
*  an issue is when it is a country that is in opposition to U.S. priorities or U.S. values. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=235.76s)]
*  And that is why with Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, we talked about it, because [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=243.7s)]
*  at the time that the administration is trying to get support for Ukraine going and get Congress [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=248.98s)]
*  on board, Viktor Orban was standing in the way in Europe of more aid to Ukraine. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=253.76s)]
*  He was also and has been saying openly racist things. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=258.38s)]
*  So that is why the Biden administration does not embrace him for the possible next president [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=264.14s)]
*  to be doing so. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=269.92s)]
*  A former president really runs counter to U.S. interests, is what the Biden administration [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=270.76s)]
*  would argue. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=275.5s)]
*  And I guess more broadly speaking, how are global leaders watching this 2024 campaign? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=276.5s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=282.88s)]
*  The number of diplomats I talked to who have who are all gaming this out, particularly [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=283.88s)]
*  in Europe, it was a question until that bill that Senator Tim Kaine and Marco Rubio co-sponsored [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=288.44s)]
*  and got through that or as an amendment to make it hard for a future president to withdraw [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  or stand in the way of NATO. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  That was crafted with one man in mind, the potential president, Donald Trump, because [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=301.88s)]
*  of his criticism of NATO. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=307.38s)]
*  So there is planning on national security matters taking place to hedge against some [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=308.82s)]
*  of these risks that European leaders would say in particular are posed by the Trump administration. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  But whether it's Asia, whether it's the Middle East, there is an eye towards election year [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=320.24s)]
*  politics and how things might change. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  There's been speculation that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might be trying [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=326.48s)]
*  to wait things out. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=330.92s)]
*  He's politically embattled. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=332.6s)]
*  And he was at one time close to Mr. Trump, though they seem to have some public spats [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=334.68s)]
*  as well. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=339.12s)]
*  So the entire world is watching this election and the world is literally on a knife's edge [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=340.12s)]
*  on so many different fronts and so many different wars. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=346.44s)]
*  Well, really fascinating discussion. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  Margaret Brennan, thank you so much for your reporting. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=351.76s)]
*  And you can see Margaret on Face the Nation this coming Sunday right here on CBS News. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lay9iXFhJeQ&t=354.16s)]
