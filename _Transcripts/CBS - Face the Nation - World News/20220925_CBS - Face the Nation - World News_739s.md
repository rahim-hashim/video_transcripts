# "I don't think he's bluffing": Zelenskyy says Putin's nuclear threats "could be a reality"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM)
*  When we spoke to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Saturday, we began with Vladimir Putin's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=0.0s)]
*  referendum in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. Actions intended to help him justify [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=4.32s)]
*  annexing territory, which is equivalent to the size of the state of Maine. It is illegal under [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=10.24s)]
*  international law. The U.S. says they're a sham and intended to take about 15 percent of your [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=15.68s)]
*  territory away. What happens to Ukrainians living in these areas if they respond no when they are [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=22.88s)]
*  asked if they want to be part of Russia? The referendum can lead to very tragic moments. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=32.48s)]
*  You started your question with an answer that is correct. Those people who don't come to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=41.92s)]
*  referendum, you know, Russians can turn off their electricity and won't give them an opportunity to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=49.2s)]
*  live a normal human life. They force people, they throw them in prisons, they force them to come to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=56.64s)]
*  these pseudo-referenda. And also, they also announced mobilization. They're forcing people [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=65.92s)]
*  to fight, people from the temporarily occupied territories. I see other threats when they [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=75.44s)]
*  complete, if they succeed with this referendum. The ballots had been already prepared. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=82.64s)]
*  The Russian government can officially announce that the referendum had been completed, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  and the results will be announced. This would make it impossible in any case [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=100.64s)]
*  to continue any diplomatic negotiations with the president of Russian Federation. And he knows it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=111.28s)]
*  very well. I have spoken about it publicly. I think it's a very dangerous signal from President [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=118.56s)]
*  Putin that tells us that Putin is not going to finish this war. That is what's going on. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=126.08s)]
*  The Biden administration has built its entire policy around avoiding direct conflict with Russia. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=136.48s)]
*  Once this annexation happens, does it change that dynamic? Is Russia using this as an excuse [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=143.84s)]
*  to say that it is being attacked because the West is providing Ukraine with weapons [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=151.84s)]
*  if it is seizing eastern Ukraine to annex it? Yes, that's exactly so. That is correct. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  Look, he knows, he feels it, and his military leadership reports to him. He knows that he's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  losing the war. In the battlefield, Ukraine has ceased the initiative. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=176.4s)]
*  He cannot explain to his society why, and he's looking for answers to these [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=182.16s)]
*  questions. It's seven months since Russia tried to occupy Ukraine, but they couldn't. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=189.36s)]
*  And now he has to justify. He has to take steps to justify. He says, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=196.4s)]
*  see, let's look at it. I am not afraid of Ukraine. It was a special operation, but now [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  it's Russia. It's our territory. Look, we conducted referenda. Now it's the West who attacks Russia. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=208.96s)]
*  Now the West attacks our territories. We have let the society join Russia, the society that wanted [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  to be with Russia. He has announced the mobilization. It used to be hidden. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=228.4s)]
*  Now you see that it has been announced publicly. For several months, they've been secretly [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=234.8s)]
*  mobilizing, but now they admitted that their army is not able to fight with Ukraine anymore. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  Vladimir Putin continues to dangle the threat of nuclear weapons use. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=251.28s)]
*  You've called this nuclear blackmail. Do you think he's bluffing right now? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=257.12s)]
*  Look, maybe yesterday it was bluff. Now it could be a reality. Let's look. What is a contemporary [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  use of nuclear weapons or nuclear blackmail? He targeted and occupied our nuclear power plant [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=272.32s)]
*  and the city of Energo Dar. He continues his blackmail related to us exporting electricity [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=285.36s)]
*  to Europe. Several days ago, they started shooting at another nuclear power plant. The nuclear plant [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=293.44000000000005s)]
*  lost all the windows and doors, etc. So he wants to scare the whole world. These are the first steps [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=301.04s)]
*  of his nuclear blackmail. I don't think he's bluffing. I think the world is [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=308.64s)]
*  deterring it and containing this threat. We need to keep [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  putting pressure on him and not allow him to continue. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=320.8s)]
*  President Biden has said more sanctions are coming. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=324.88s)]
*  I think that there are sanctions that must be implemented towards the very end, completely. If [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=328.56s)]
*  we cut Russian banks from Swift, we need to cut all Russian banks from Swift. If we talk about [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=337.36s)]
*  for energy, we need not to look for compromises or we need to make sure that this embargo will be [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=350.72s)]
*  working and all the prices would be implemented according to the embargo. Because the profits [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=362.32s)]
*  from these imports support the Russian army and fund the war. The United States could show its [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  leadership position and recognize Russia as a sponsor of terrorism. I understand there will be [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=383.6s)]
*  implications. These implications will make diplomatic negotiations impossible. However, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=391.12s)]
*  they are terrorists and we cannot let them do it out of fear. They will not surrender. We need to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  keep applying pressure. They are terrorists. They don't have honor. They cannot keep their word. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=410.64s)]
*  They do not kill military personnel. They rape, torture and kill civilians. We found a big mass [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  grave of half a thousand people. Today I received more information. The journalists are on their way. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=424.88s)]
*  They found two more mass graves, big graves with hundreds of people also. And we are talking about [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=433.44s)]
*  a little town of Izum. Do you know there are two more mass graves in a small town? This is what's [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=442.8s)]
*  going on. The sanctions need to continue. These sanctions will have political impact as well as [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=452.56s)]
*  financial impact. The U.S. has released intelligence about Russia's filtration centers that it is [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=463.52s)]
*  putting Ukrainians into and estimate that hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children are being taken [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=472.24s)]
*  to Russia. Does forcibly separating kids from their families constitute genocide? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=480.32s)]
*  We have all the information about filtration camps, isolation camps. People are being tortured with [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=488.0s)]
*  various means. They apply pressure. They torture with electric current and so on. And apart from [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=496.48s)]
*  that there's deportation. I can't say exact numbers. I don't want to lie. I want you to know [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=507.2s)]
*  all the truth. I can't say or confirm that hundreds of thousands of children have been deported [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=514.8s)]
*  because families have been separated. But it's absolute true that there are thousands of these [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=521.04s)]
*  children. We have confirmed that. Offensive operations are more expensive than defensive [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=528.56s)]
*  operations. The White House is asking Congress for 12 billion dollars more to provide to Ukraine. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=537.04s)]
*  What do you need this money for? What is essential right now? Thousands of people have been killed, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  raped, tortured. That's why we need this help to de-occupy our territories to make sure that more [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  people survive. I don't think that this is the highest price in the world to save thousands of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=557.92s)]
*  lives. We're very thankful for High Mars and other MLRSs that give us an ability to conduct [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=564.64s)]
*  our offensive. Our army sees the initiative cuts the technical capabilities of Russia. Second, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=572.64s)]
*  artillery. Artillery helps us to save the lives of our warriors, our fighters. They need an opportunity [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=583.52s)]
*  to get supplies of tanks from the United States as well as Europe. If the U.S. will be able to [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=593.28s)]
*  show its leadership and will be able to get the tanks, then Germany and other European countries [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=600.96s)]
*  will follow. I think if we get tanks from the U.S., European allies will also help us to [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=612.0s)]
*  de-occupy Ukrainian cities with tanks, air defense systems. We absolutely need the United States to [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=618.8s)]
*  show leadership and give Ukraine the air defense systems. I want to thank President Biden for a [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=629.52s)]
*  positive decision that has been already made. And to the U.S. Congress, we received NASEMs. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=638.64s)]
*  It's the air defense system. But believe me, it's not even nearly enough to cover the civilian [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=647.28s)]
*  infrastructure, schools, hospitals, universities, homes of Ukrainians. Can there be stability in [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=655.36s)]
*  Europe if Vladimir Putin remains in power? No. No? I don't have anything to add. My opinion is no. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=663.36s)]
*  We have observed this over the years. We don't see stability. Mr. President, thank you for your [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  time today. I do want to ask before I let you go, you have kept Ukraine united during this war. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=684.72s)]
*  Have you seen evidence that Vladimir Putin will now come and target you in this moment of desperation? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=691.92s)]
*  You are very right in saying that we are united. We have become even more united now than ever. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=698.88s)]
*  I'm one of the targets. Of course, it goes without saying. It's not because of my [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=709.76s)]
*  personality, just because the president is a leader of their country. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=715.8399999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you for your time and good luck to you, sir. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=724.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. We will need it. We wish you peace and everything. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=730.9599999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much for your support, the United States. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzAx7ECnJpM&t=735.4399999999999s)]
