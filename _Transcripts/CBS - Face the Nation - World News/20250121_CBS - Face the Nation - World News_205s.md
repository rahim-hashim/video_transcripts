# Why China is trying to stay on Trumpâ€™s good side
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE)
*  During the campaign, President Trump said he would increase tariffs on Chinese goods, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=0.0s)]
*  but when asked Monday about when he might impose those tariffs, he didn't give an exact [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=3.84s)]
*  date and instead pointing to actions taken during his first term and under the Biden [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=8.0s)]
*  administration. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=12.08s)]
*  As you know, I put on large tariffs on China and they've really been forced to leave them. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=13.08s)]
*  And if we didn't leave them, you wouldn't have one steel mill that's open in this country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=18.96s)]
*  We're going to have meetings and calls with President Xi. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=22.36s)]
*  I spoke to President Xi last week, as you know. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=25.8s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  I have a very good phone call. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  President Trump told reporters he received an invite to visit China and could travel [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  there this year. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=36.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, China's vice president attended the inauguration despite the tariff threat. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=37.16s)]
*  The Trump team says he met with Vice President Vance on Sunday and discussed fentanyl, trade [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=41.4s)]
*  and regional stability. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=45.6s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Erna Coren joins us now from Hong Kong. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=46.92s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=50.84s)]
*  How has China reacted thus far to the new Trump administration? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=51.84s)]
*  Yeah, Lindsay, I have to say that people are feeling cautiously optimistic. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=54.32s)]
*  I think that's because we're not hearing the China bashing that everyone was prepared for, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=61.32s)]
*  certainly hearing in Hong Kong and on mainland China. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=66.88s)]
*  That sentiment and rhetoric from Trump, certainly on the campaign trail, that threat of 60 percent [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=70.44s)]
*  tariffs, it just has not played out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=75.4s)]
*  But as we know, we are only a few days into this administration. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=78.56s)]
*  We heard from President Trump. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=83.56s)]
*  He mentioned that phone call he had with President Xi on Friday night and that invite to China. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=84.84s)]
*  That will be his first trip to China since 2017. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=92.5s)]
*  So that will be a big deal when he does make that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=97.8s)]
*  He said he'll do it in his first 100 days. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=101.68s)]
*  We should note that President Biden never went to China during his term in office. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=104.08s)]
*  And then I think what is also playing into this good feeling and certainly in this part [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=109.7s)]
*  of the world is TikTok, the reprieve for TikTok. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=114.14s)]
*  And as we heard from President Trump, he has a warm spot for TikTok. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=118.34s)]
*  But really, he has only delayed this for 75 days. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=121.3s)]
*  That executive order to his attorney general, ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, has [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  75 days to agree to sell to a US company. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=131.3s)]
*  This, of course, Lindsay, is where the sticking point will be between the United States and China. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=137.34s)]
*  Yeah. Has China responded yet to that idea of a US company owning 50 percent of the app? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=141.9s)]
*  Look, China has maintained all along that TikTok is not for sale. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=149.86s)]
*  So this is going to be the problem. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=155.66000000000003s)]
*  So the threat of tariffs, we are yet to hear from President Trump on that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=157.94s)]
*  He's singled out Mexico and Canada instead. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=162.26000000000002s)]
*  But this is perhaps where he will use the threat of tariffs in trying to get that TikTok deal through. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=165.54s)]
*  Obviously, it is a huge issue and something that President Trump wants to make happen, make this deal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=173.42s)]
*  But I've spoken to analysts in this part of the world, think tanks who advise the Chinese government, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=182.38s)]
*  and they think that this reprieve for TikTok is really a gesture of of goodwill. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=188.38s)]
*  So that is why the Chinese are certainly being being warm at this stage to to to Donald Trump. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=194.22s)]
*  Anna Corrin, thank you for joining The Daily Report. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=200.7s)]
*  Please come back. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlTmsyPXvE&t=203.1s)]
