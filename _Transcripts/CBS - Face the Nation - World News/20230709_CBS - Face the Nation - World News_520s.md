# Sen. Chris Coons says "we can't admit Ukraine to NATO right now"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI)
*  We turn now to Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons. Good morning. Good to have you here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. Great to be on set with you, Margaret. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=4.72s)]
*  A lot to talk about, but I want to start with China. America's reliant on its greatest adversary [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  for key things, for missiles, for computer chips, electric vehicles. Do we need a domestic [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=11.6s)]
*  industrial policy? And why don't we have one? We do have one. Margaret, that's what the chips [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=18.0s)]
*  and science bill that President Biden signed into law last year that the Congress moved forward on [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=22.56s)]
*  a bipartisan basis has delivered. Tens of billions of dollars of new investments in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=27.76s)]
*  on-shoring semiconductor chip manufacturing, a record number of new advanced manufacturing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=32.96s)]
*  sites in the United States. There is more work for us to do on this in this Congress, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  and Senator Schumer and Republicans in the Senate are leading work on that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  So we have turned a corner on having an industrial policy in the United States [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=46.96s)]
*  that brings back manufacturing. That's the core of Bidenomics, of rebuilding our economy [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  from the middle out. But what we were just talking about with the Treasury Secretary is August 1st, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=57.04s)]
*  China's going to stop the export of key minerals. So to make those chips, you need what China has. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=60.48s)]
*  That's right. So where do you get that from? So China is in a commanding position on the processing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=66.48s)]
*  of strategic critical minerals. The administration has a plan, has a program underway with a dozen [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=72.08s)]
*  countries around the world that are our allies and partners who have untapped resources. I was just [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=78.8s)]
*  on a bipartisan trip to Europe. We visited Norway, which has critical minerals in abundance, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=84.8s)]
*  several of them that we need, that China currently has. There is a plan and a path forward. And as [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=90.16s)]
*  long as we sustain our bipartisan support for it, I think there is a clear path to transition away [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  from what is currently a dangerous dependency on China for these strategic minerals. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  I want to ask you about Europe. President Biden is leaving today on this trip that will involve [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=106.4s)]
*  a stop at NATO. I know that you have signed on to efforts to help Sweden get into NATO, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=111.84s)]
*  but Turkey is standing in the way. You've said you're fine with withholding F-16s, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=118.56s)]
*  those kind of military equipment provisions to Turkey, until they back down. Are they going to? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  We'll have to see. President Biden is directly personally engaged in this diplomacy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=129.04s)]
*  The Greeks need and deserve security reassurances that the lessening of tensions with Turkey will [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=134.08s)]
*  continue. We are continuing to provide cutting-edge equipment like the F-35 to our critical NATO [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=140.4s)]
*  partner Greece. As long as Greece is reassured, Sweden has taken the steps they should to address [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=147.52s)]
*  Turkey's legitimate concerns. I remain hopeful that there will be a resolution of this before [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=154.0s)]
*  the Vilnius summit. We have 31 members of NATO today. There should be 32. Adding Finland and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=159.6s)]
*  Sweden to NATO is a strategic defeat for Putin. It means that no matter the outcome on the ground [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=165.6s)]
*  in Ukraine, he has failed in his objective to divide and weaken NATO. Because of President [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=171.12s)]
*  Biden's leadership, NATO is the strongest it's ever been. You have another applicant, Ukraine, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  as you know. The president gave an interview in which he said he doesn't think Ukraine is ready [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=183.2s)]
*  to join NATO. Have you talked to him about it, and what specifically is it that he needs to see for [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=188.24s)]
*  them to be allowed in? They've been waiting since 2008. Well, first, we can't admit Ukraine to NATO [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=193.04s)]
*  right now. There's a war going on that has to be resolved, that has to end with Ukrainian victory. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  I was just on a bipartisan trip, as I mentioned, with Senator Murray, chair of appropriations, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=202.88s)]
*  to meet with EU leaders and NATO leaders. It's important to keep in mind that what the Ukrainians [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=207.84s)]
*  are fighting for is full membership in Europe, and they are on track to join the EU. Joining the EU [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  also means improving their transparency, their rule of law, their civil society, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=218.88s)]
*  which lays the foundation for NATO membership in the future. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=224.32s)]
*  President Zelensky has said he knows it's in the future. It's not drawing the United States into a [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=229.12s)]
*  war, in other words, if he were to get in this week, which the White House said he won't. But [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  the president also said something about an Israel-style assurance of defense for Ukraine. That [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=237.6s)]
*  sounds very open-ended. We give billions of dollars to Israel. What does that mean for Ukraine? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=244.0s)]
*  There has to be a security guarantee for Ukraine going forward. For them to be conceivably [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=250.0s)]
*  admissible to NATO, their equipment, their training, their military has to be up to NATO [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=256.32s)]
*  standards. And we are moving them in that direction. But I'll remind you, back in 1994, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=261.68s)]
*  in Budapest, the US, UK and Russia persuaded Ukraine to give up their nuclear weapons [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=267.6s)]
*  in exchange for a commitment to a territorial security guarantee. Some sort of security [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=273.6s)]
*  guarantee for Ukraine has to be on the far side of this war, where so many Ukrainians are fighting [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=278.8s)]
*  and dying bravely to push back out the Russian aggressors who are occupying 20 percent of Ukraine [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=284.48s)]
*  today. But you don't expect any firm assurances out of this week's summit? No timeline, no specifics? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=290.56s)]
*  That's a decision for 31 NATO members to make. My hunch is they'll make real progress on Sweden [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=296.32000000000005s)]
*  accession. They'll make real progress on sustaining our critical support in the middle of this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=302.64s)]
*  counteroffensive. But I don't think they'll leave Vilnius with a specific timeline. President Biden [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=307.12s)]
*  said that Ukraine's military is running out of ammunition, and that was a factor in his decision [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  to greenlight providing cluster munitions. Do you think that morally justified his decision to do [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=318.4s)]
*  this? I do. This was a very hard decision. The president really, he listened to all sides. Did [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=325.44s)]
*  you speak to him about it? I did not speak directly to him about this decision. I weighed in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=331.36s)]
*  indirectly through folks in his core team, but bluntly he looked at several different core factors. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=335.68s)]
*  First, we are running out of 155 artillery munitions, and they are burning through them at a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  remarkable rate, six to eight thousand a day. That's a million a year. We have a plan to bring [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  back online the manufacturing of 155 shells at scale, but that won't happen for months. They are [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  at risk of losing this counteroffensive if they run out of their shells. We have a large stockpile [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=357.76s)]
*  of 155 shells that are cluster munitions. It's the Ukrainians who are asking to be able to use these [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  on their own soil. They've committed to monitoring their use, to remediating them after the war, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  and frankly they will be tactically helpful against dug-in Russian troops that are behind [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=373.84s)]
*  large minefields. So weighing all of those factors, the president made a tough call that I will support. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=379.28s)]
*  You will support. I want to ask you as well about Iran. The president's envoy to Iran, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=385.84s)]
*  his name is Rob Malley, and he told CBS that he is on leave right now pending a review of his security [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  clearance. He's so central to the nuclear talks and also the point of contact for the hostage [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=398.8s)]
*  families. Have you been briefed on what's happening? I have not. On his security situation, I have not. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=404.64s)]
*  In your key role on Senate Foreign Relations, I would imagine there is some oversight. There [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  is some reporting that the FBI is now involved. Are you concerned? How should people understand this? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=416.4s)]
*  Look, I can't share anything about the FBI and what they are or are not doing with regards to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  the special envoy. But there is a lot of concern and interest in Congress on that committee and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=427.67999999999995s)]
*  others about the status of any potential negotiation with Iran. The Iranians are providing [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=432.64s)]
*  the Russians critical drones and munitions for their aggression in Ukraine. I think that puts [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=438.24s)]
*  even greater tension on any possible conversations between the United States, our regional allies, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=444.48s)]
*  and Iran. And I do think we need a briefing to update the members of Congress. On this matter [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=450.56s)]
*  as well as the talks, do you think that the president should meet with the families of those [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=455.92s)]
*  hostages in Iran? They have been asking for some time. Look, you know, I'm an advocate for the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=461.76s)]
*  hostages, broadly speaking. Jason Rezaian, who was held in an Iranian prison for more than 500 days, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=467.28s)]
*  came home and received an IRS bill in the mail as a result for unpaid taxes. I just introduced a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  bipartisan bill to get rid of those undue, unexpected, unreasonable harms. Yes, I think [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  the president should meet with hostage families. He has a lot on his plate. He has been a strong [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  advocate for recovering Americans from overseas. As you know, his administration led the return of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=492.64s)]
*  Brittany Greiner. I am hoping that there will also be some movement in the case of a Wall Street [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  Journal reporter who is unjustly imprisoned in Russia as well. Evan Grishkovich. Do you have reason [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  to believe that that is moving forward? I have reason to believe the administration is working [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=509.52s)]
*  tirelessly on trying to return all Americans who are unjustly detained. Senator, thank you for your [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=513.84s)]
*  time this morning. Thank you. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhocUmNKDFI&t=519.28s)]
