# Why is Trump reportedly considering military action against Iran in his next term?
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY)
*  President-elect Donald Trump and his allies are reportedly considering military action against Iran after he takes office [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=0.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reports Trump is considering options to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon including potential preemptive airstrikes [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=6.12s)]
*  The warning comes after Trump addressed tensions with Iran in a Time magazine interview [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=14.18s)]
*  When asked about the chances of going to war with Iran during his next term Trump responded quote anything can happen [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=19.28s)]
*  It's a very volatile situation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=26.060000000000002s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd joins us now for our weekly national security wrap-up [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=28.38s)]
*  So Sam, what do we know about Trump's approach to Iran? We've learned a lot obviously from his first term in office [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=34.379999999999995s)]
*  I'm wondering if that has changed and can you also give us just an update on the state of Iran's nuclear program? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=40.8s)]
*  Well Trump and Biden have historically had different approaches to trying to counter Iranian aggression [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=47.7s)]
*  During his first term President Trump bombed Iran directly launched a direct military strike [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=53.36s)]
*  Against former general Qassem Soleimani [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=59.28s)]
*  So the notion that Trump would consider preemptive military strikes in a second administration is totally plausible [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=61.959999999999994s)]
*  Trump also withdrew the United States for the from the Iran nuclear deal [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  After Trump Iran withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal Iran's nuclear program progressed under the Biden [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=73.44s)]
*  administration [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  Secretary of State Blinken said just this summer that Iran was one to two weeks away from breaking out to a nuclear weapon in a more [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=82.18s)]
*  recent US intelligence community report indicated that Iran has greatly increased its stockpiles of nuclear material and is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=89.72s)]
*  operating several underground facilities as part of its nuclear program [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  Importantly though the US intelligence community has assessed that Iran has not [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=103.04s)]
*  Made a decision to actually break out to a nuclear weapon at this stage [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=108.32s)]
*  So Trump has not taken military action off the table [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=112.88s)]
*  But as of now Iran reportedly has not decided to move forward towards actually building a nuclear weapon [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=116.32s)]
*  So Sam here in the Northeast there's been a lot of talk about drone sightings [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=123.16s)]
*  We're gonna move on to a slightly different topic if we could the governor of New Jersey [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=127.88s)]
*  Is asking the federal government for more resources to respond to these sightings? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=132.44s)]
*  There's some [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=137.08s)]
*  Theories that these are foreign actors. I'm wondering what more you can tell us about the drone situation [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  The federal government has said very clearly that there is no foreign nexus [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=144.44s)]
*  Associated with these drone sightings and that these drone sightings don't pose a public safety or national security risk at the same time [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  There have been hundreds if not thousands of reported sightings over New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=155.38s)]
*  The federal government has surged resources to try to investigate the sources of these drones and to where appropriate [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=161.72s)]
*  Try to mitigate these drones in the national airspace [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=168.88s)]
*  Unfortunately state and local law enforcement currently lacks the authority and the equipment to mitigate or safely land these drones [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=173.0s)]
*  So the ball is really in federal authorities court to figure out who is behind these drones and then to try to mitigate any [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=181.0s)]
*  Potential risk facing the public at this time [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=188.12s)]
*  So Sam how concerned should be people should people be about some of these high-profile targets that these drones are? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=191.2s)]
*  Reportedly flying over the military has said that these drones don't pose a threat to military installations [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=198.56s)]
*  What is of utmost concern to me at this time Lana is the fact that individuals? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  May seek to take action themselves and try to mitigate these drones and shoot them down themselves [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=209.6s)]
*  President-elect Trump did urge individuals to shoot the drones out of the sky [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  But if an individual does engage in some sort of vigilante action that they view as necessary from a self-defense perspective [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=219.88s)]
*  That could actually lead to aerial debris that poses a real risk to the communities underneath the drone [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=226.96s)]
*  Yeah, because some of these drones are reported to be as large as the size of a car [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=233.16s)]
*  So that's different from maybe the little toy drones that some of us have out there and significantly different when it comes to raining debris [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=237.24s)]
*  Sam let's talk about inauguration because there was a lot of speculation about Chinese President [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=244.6s)]
*  Xi Jinping who was invited to come to Trump's inauguration [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=249.72s)]
*  He's expected to decline, but there's also an active [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=254.0s)]
*  Invitation that's out to Viktor Orban of Hungary. He is not the kind of person that normally would be on [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=258.76s)]
*  the list to to come to the White House let alone the very [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=267.12s)]
*  significant change of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=272.12s)]
*  Inviting heads of state actually to inauguration unlike lower-level diplomats [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=273.6s)]
*  What stands out to you about these? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=279.4s)]
*  Invites and what might it mean about in terms of the type of foreign policy that we should expect from the Trump administration? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=282.68s)]
*  Well, the invitations are unprecedented a foreign leader has never visited a president as part of inauguration lower-level foreign officials have attended [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=291.0s)]
*  What this really tells me is that President Trump is going to really value face-to-face [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=299.6s)]
*  Interactions as part of his next administration [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=304.8s)]
*  He has of course already said he'll impose greater tariffs on China about 10% at this point [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=307.6s)]
*  So he's invited President Xi Jinping to his inauguration who is viewed at the very least at a strategic competitor [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  His invitation to Viktor Orban is unsurprising insofar as Viktor Orban has been a staunch ally of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  President-elect Trump even during the interregnum between President-elect Trump's first term the Biden administration and his reelection [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  so we should expect President-elect Trump to reward loyalty with invitations and to try to use face-to-face engagement with strategic competitors and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  adversaries to try to win them over and to convince them to do what President-elect Trump views is in the best interest of the United States [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  So those were two of the names Sam, but is it possible that we might see other invitations extended to world leaders? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=348.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't think we can rule out any invitations going out to any world leaders ahead of this inauguration based upon President-elect Trump's [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=354.18s)]
*  Unprecedented approach to this upcoming inauguration Lana. All right, Sam Vinograd always enjoy speaking with you. Thank you [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKjKnvBhOY&t=362.82s)]
