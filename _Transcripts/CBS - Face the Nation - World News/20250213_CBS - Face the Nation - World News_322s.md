# How Haitian gang violence affects children
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4)
*  A new Amnesty International report is giving us a deeper look at the harrowing effect gang violence has had on children in Haiti. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=0.0s)]
*  We want to warn you, some of the details of this report may be disturbing. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=8.0s)]
*  Amnesty International interviewed 51 Haitian boys and girls ages 10 to 17 in 2024. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=12.0s)]
*  Many of them spoke about being coerced into working for violent gangs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=19.0s)]
*  In many cases, young girls say they were subject to sexual violence, including being raped in order to save their lives and that of their families. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=24.0s)]
*  Amnesty International called the violent environment in Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince, quote, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=33.0s)]
*  nothing short of an attack on childhood. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=38.0s)]
*  For more, let's bring in Jacqueline Charles. She's a Caribbean correspondent for the Miami Herald. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=41.0s)]
*  Jacqueline, very disturbing indeed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=46.0s)]
*  Before we get to the report, can you please give us an update on what's been going on inside Haiti politically in regards to the ongoing violence? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=48.0s)]
*  Well, yes, I mean, today, as we were preparing to talk, a gang set fire to the largest public hospital. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=55.0s)]
*  It is the only place that someone who doesn't have the means can go and get dialysis treatment. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=64.0s)]
*  Just in December, they opened fire on the courtyard and two journalists were killed. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=70.0s)]
*  Others were injured. They were waiting for a press conference. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=75.0s)]
*  There still isn't an election, although the head of the presidential council said that he sees elections this year. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=79.0s)]
*  But that remains to be seen. As we're speaking, gangs have occupied an area above the capital in the mountains. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=86.0s)]
*  It's a farming community. More than 100 people have been killed. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=94.0s)]
*  People have been forced out of their homes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=98.0s)]
*  People who are self-sufficient are now dependent on others for three meals a day if they can get that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=101.0s)]
*  And the reason why this is critical is because they are trying to move into the last parts of the capital that are not currently under occupied by gangs. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=107.0s)]
*  And if they do, then the quarter principal will just be completely controlled by gangs. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=115.0s)]
*  How has this gang violence, particularly involving children, gotten worse in recent years? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=121.0s)]
*  I have to tell you, you know, I was in Haiti around the same time that the industry was there and was doing this reporting, and it has gotten worse. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=127.0s)]
*  You have children who have been forced to flee with their parents. They can't go to school. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=134.0s)]
*  In many cases, when the gangs do move into these communities, they are raping. And oftentimes it's a gang rape situation. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=139.0s)]
*  Even in the camps where many children and their parents have had to flee, there are now over a million people who have been forced out of their homes, were displaced. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=148.0s)]
*  They are not safe. The camps don't have adequate lighting. They don't even have latrines sometimes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=158.0s)]
*  The UN just issued a report that says that there were 6,500 cases of gender-based violence last year. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=164.0s)]
*  A third of them were rapes, 64% committed by armed gangs. And they acknowledge that this is an undercount. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=172.0s)]
*  This is just what they know, the people who managed to report what has happened. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=179.0s)]
*  Which we know often doesn't happen out of fear of retaliation or what have you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=183.0s)]
*  For many of these children, though, there's no place for them to turn to other than gangs. Can you explain that? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=188.0s)]
*  Yes, the other reports that have come out is the fact that gang recruitment has gone up by 70% and a lot of it is children. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=195.0s)]
*  People will tell you they'll see young kids, 8, 9 years old, with AK-47 and other automatic weapons. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=203.0s)]
*  They are in these poor communities where there are no jobs, there's no food, there really is no future. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=209.0s)]
*  And so the gangs, sometimes they are left with no choice but to join the gangs or joining the gangs becomes a matter of survival. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=215.0s)]
*  They're useless lookouts. And today where we're seeing the cuts in U.S. aid and other funding, it begs to be asked, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=221.0s)]
*  while you have a thousand foreign troops on the ground being led by Kenya, what sort of assistance, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=229.0s)]
*  what kind of money is going to be available to go into these programs to encourage children, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=237.0s)]
*  you know, generation lost, not to continue to join these gangs and to help them recover from the trauma that this violence is creating. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=242.0s)]
*  What needs to be done? What can be done? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=251.0s)]
*  Well, I think it has to be a multi-pronged situation. You know, while you're focusing on how do you return security, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=254.0s)]
*  how do you take some of these communities out of the clutches of gangs, you have to figure out a way of how to make it safe for children to say no. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=260.0s)]
*  You have to give them opportunities. And that is not something that we've yet seen. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=267.0s)]
*  I've been asking, you know, the folks who get paid more than I do, are you having these conversations in terms of how do you, you know, secure communities? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=271.0s)]
*  How do you put investments in communities to give people something to fight for? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=279.0s)]
*  And how do you give children, especially the alternatives? Because that doesn't exist right now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=283.0s)]
*  Even in terms of jobs, like factory jobs, Haiti has lost tens of thousands of jobs as a result of this violence. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=288.0s)]
*  Right now, the International Airport continues to be shut down because of the FAA restrictions after gangs shot at three U.S. airliners. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=294.0s)]
*  There are no domestic flights. And if you're in the Capitol, you're completely locked in. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=302.0s)]
*  It's like a huge prison if someone has once, you know, described it. But you have to break it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=307.0s)]
*  You have to figure out how to create opportunities to play better tomorrow. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=312.0s)]
*  Jacqueline Charles, thank you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=318.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEDS4jwviH4&t=321.0s)]
