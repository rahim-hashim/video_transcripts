# Pope Francis celebrating Christmas Eve mass in newly restored St. Peter's Basilica
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw)
*  Well, Pope Francis will celebrate the Vatican's traditional Christmas Eve midnight mass in a newly restored St. Peter's Basilica. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's one of a series of projects all over Rome as the city prepares to usher in the Catholic Jubilee. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=7.0s)]
*  The Eternal City expects to see millions more visitors than usual in the new year. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=13.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Libsay has more from Rome. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=17.0s)]
*  Well, all of this because 2025 is a Jubilee year. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=22.0s)]
*  That's a tradition that dates all the way back to the year 1300. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=26.0s)]
*  It's a time of renewal and reconciliation both on the inside and on the outside. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=30.0s)]
*  And to find out exactly what the Catholic Church means by that, we got a close up look inside St. Peter's Basilica. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=37.0s)]
*  It soars 450 feet into the sky and spans more than four football fields, making it the biggest church in the world. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=44.0s)]
*  And with roots dating back more than 1600 years, it's also one of the oldest and was in need of a few touch ups with better excuse than the Jubilee, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=53.0s)]
*  a year of pilgrimage that traditionally falls every 25 years in the Catholic Church. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=63.0s)]
*  One of the biggest restorations was of Bernini's masterpiece, the Baldachian. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=68.0s)]
*  It's a canopy that sits atop the tomb of none other than the first pope ever, St. Peter, also restored the chair of St. Peter, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=74.0s)]
*  one of the most important symbols of papal power dating back to the year 875. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=83.0s)]
*  No matter if you can't come in person, the Vatican has recreated St. Peter's digitally with the help of AI, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=89.0s)]
*  allowing you to zoom in on every little niche nook and cranny from your device. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=96.0s)]
*  If you can come in person, brace yourself. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=101.0s)]
*  You'll be joined by more than 35 million visitors to Rome over the course of 2025 as the Eternal City undergoes its own facelift from the Colosseum to the Trevi Fountain. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=104.0s)]
*  But the main event is at St. Peter's, where Michelangelo's tear inducing Pieta is protected by new bulletproof glass. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=116.0s)]
*  And just beside it, the Holy Door representing the path to salvation. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=125.0s)]
*  Pope Francis will open the Holy Door or the Porta Santa later tonight at 7 p.m. Rome time, followed by his midnight mass. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=131.0s)]
*  Local authorities say they have tightened security all around the city of Rome following that Christmas market attack in Germany. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=141.0s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=150.0s)]
*  All right, Chris, live, say thank you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBNmKbYLKw&t=151.0s)]
