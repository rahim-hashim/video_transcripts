# Trump vows to impose tariffs on major U.S. trading partners
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ)
*  You want to allow drugs to come through our southern border? We're going to tariff you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You want to allow them to come through Canada? We're going to tariff you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=4.0s)]
*  We are going to cost your countries, your economies, we're going to cost your businesses [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=7.0s)]
*  billions, hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=11.0s)]
*  That was Eric Trump, the son of President-elect Trump, defending his father's promise to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=14.0s)]
*  impose major tariffs on goods from the United States, three largest trading partners. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=19.0s)]
*  The president-elect has justified this position as what he believes is an effort to curb [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=24.0s)]
*  migration and the flow of fentanyl into the United States. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=29.0s)]
*  He's been making that case publicly. Trump is now threatening to add 25 percent on tariffs, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=32.0s)]
*  25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, plus an extra 10 percent on goods from China. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=38.0s)]
*  He was already, I believe, based on our reporting, proposing 60 percent tariffs on Chinese [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=44.0s)]
*  goods. To discuss all of this and the economic and political impact, Mario Parker joins us now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=49.0s)]
*  He is a Bloomberg News managing editor and focused on the economy and government. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=54.0s)]
*  Let's begin, Mario, by looking at what the Canadian leader Justin Trudeau had to say about all of this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=59.0s)]
*  I had a good call with Donald Trump last night again. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=67.0s)]
*  We obviously talked about letting out the facts, talking about how the intense and effective [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=71.0s)]
*  connections between our two countries flow back and forth. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=80.0s)]
*  This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on, and that's what we'll do. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=83.0s)]
*  So you hear Prime Minister Trudeau. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=88.0s)]
*  Do you believe Canada, Mexico, China will retaliate on these tariffs or at least these promises come next year? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=92.0s)]
*  Well, what you heard from Prime Minister Trudeau was a little bit of muscle memory there, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=101.0s)]
*  He's gone through round one with Trump. He sees how this has gone before. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=105.0s)]
*  In terms of his rhetoric hasn't been as tense as, say, the shine bombs has, right? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=109.0s)]
*  Where Xi, surprisingly... [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=116.0s)]
*  The Mexican leader. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=118.0s)]
*  Yes, the Mexican president. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=119.0s)]
*  Where Xi said that essentially no one wins in a trade war, however, expect some tariffs and pain to be inflicted on both sides. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=120.0s)]
*  And then, of course, China with its rhetoric saying that, again, similarly, no one wins in a trade war. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=129.0s)]
*  But we've seen the tit-for-tat trade war between Washington and Beijing that marked Trump's first term here in Washington. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=135.0s)]
*  What's notable about what Trump is saying, if anything, on China? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=142.0s)]
*  I mean, he's already proposed sweeping tariffs. What do you make of the escalation? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=145.0s)]
*  Well, I interviewed President Trump over the summer, and it was remarkable just how much he thought that tariffs were the panacea for anything [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=149.0s)]
*  that he has to confront him in terms of geopolitics, right? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=158.0s)]
*  We saw whether or not there were mixed results from the first trade war, right? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=163.0s)]
*  What did he say to you? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=168.0s)]
*  He talked about that tariffs are a way to level the playing field, that he's been able to avert wars that we don't know about [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=169.0s)]
*  or conflicts that we don't know about due to the threat of tariffs before, how tariffs are... [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=176.0s)]
*  The American people, economists, have it wrong, right? This is what he's saying. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=182.0s)]
*  Economists say that this will lead to inflation here in the U.S. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=187.0s)]
*  President Trump is saying that actually, on the contrary, tariffs are a wash. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=190.0s)]
*  And again, they solve all of the problems. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=194.0s)]
*  You heard him say that they would be used to fund some of the pay-fors for his tax cuts that he's presented as well. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=196.0s)]
*  In terms of the relationship with China specifically, what is surprising... [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=203.0s)]
*  Again, he's been signaling that he's going to do this for a while. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=209.0s)]
*  What is surprising is that now he's saying essentially if you add on 10 percent to the 60 percent he's already proposed, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=212.0s)]
*  now we're looking at about upwards of 70 percent in tariffs before he even is inaugurated into office. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=218.0s)]
*  What do you make, though, of the president-elect talking a big game on tariffs, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=224.0s)]
*  but two of the biggest proponents of tariffs in his circle, Peter Navarro and Robert Lighthizer, have yet to be named to the administration? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=229.0s)]
*  It is remarkable that Lighthizer, because he was the architect of the first go-round with the tariffs, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=236.0s)]
*  whether or not, we'll see whether or not he's still, the administration is still coming together. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=242.0s)]
*  He's named some of his key economic advisers so far. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=246.0s)]
*  We'll see whether or not Lighthizer has a role in the administration. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=252.0s)]
*  Navarro will probably have a role in the administration in some part as well. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=256.0s)]
*  Does Congress have a role in trade policy anymore or not? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=261.0s)]
*  And that's what we'll see, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=264.0s)]
*  We'll see whether or not the Republicans have a majority here [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=266.0s)]
*  and whether or not the Senate, the House, will be the rubber stamp that Donald Trump expects it to be. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=270.0s)]
*  We saw some pushback with some of the nominations, one in particular over the last few days, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=277.0s)]
*  whether or not Congress goes along with this, because what you have to remember, as you well know, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=283.0s)]
*  is the economic pain that will be inflicted, round one, a lot of the economic pain was inflicted in the heartland. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=289.0s)]
*  These countries know how to strategically and surgically pinpoint parts of Donald Trump's base. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=296.0s)]
*  Whether or not those Congress folks who are associated with those districts are willing to take on the pain [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=302.0s)]
*  will be something we'll have to see. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=309.0s)]
*  Sounds like a trade skirmish on the horizon, if not a trade war. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=311.0s)]
*  We'll see. Mario Parker, thank you, we appreciate it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870yJxSXmoQ&t=314.0s)]
