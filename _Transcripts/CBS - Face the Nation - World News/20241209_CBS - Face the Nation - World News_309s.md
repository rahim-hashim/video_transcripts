# What we know about Syrian rebel group that overthrew Bashar al-Assad's regime
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik)
*  Thousands of Syrians poured into the streets around the world to celebrate the end of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=0.0s)]
*  half century regime of Bashar al-Assad and his family over the weekend. Hours after rebels seized [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=6.8s)]
*  control of the country's capital, Damascus, the ousted leader reportedly fled to Moscow. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  The takeover marked the first time opposition forces reached Damascus since 2018. President [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Biden called it quote a moment of historic opportunity. The leader possibly in control [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=25.28s)]
*  the country's future has ties to a group considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  and the U.N. National security advisor Jake Sullivan asked if that alternative to Assad [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=36.8s)]
*  is better on CBS mornings and he said this take a listen. Anything is better than a regime that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=42.32s)]
*  has brutalized and massacred its people over 50 years. There is an opportunity to build something [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=50.24s)]
*  significantly better going forward. But as you know there are risks too. There are risks associated [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=56.72s)]
*  with the possible resurgence of extremism and terrorism in Syria and we are trying to attend [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  to those risks immediately including airstrikes that President Biden ordered yesterday against [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=67.2s)]
*  ISIS so that they can't take advantage of the situation. We're going to work with all the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=71.92s)]
*  groups in Syria and as President Biden said yesterday the rebel groups including the ones [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=76.0s)]
*  that have been designated as terrorist groups have actually said all the right things. Now the question [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=80.96s)]
*  is what will they do to try to bring about a better Syria. CBS News national security contributor Sam [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=86.0s)]
*  Vinograd joins us now on what we need to know about all this. Sam first I want to get your reaction [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=91.84s)]
*  to what we just heard from Jake Sullivan. What do we know about this rebel group that's now controlling Syria? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=96.56s)]
*  This rebel group that led to the toppling of Bashar al-Assad is a designated foreign terrorist [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=103.36s)]
*  organization. That designation was made by the U.S. State Department in 2018. This group evolved [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=108.48s)]
*  out of an offshoot of Al-Qaeda known as the al-Nusra Front. This group has been focused on the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=114.8s)]
*  overthrow of Bashar al-Assad and what remains to be seen is whether they will in fact govern in a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  democratic and stable way and that's why Jake Sullivan indicated that their words in which [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=129.04s)]
*  they've said the right things and they've said what the United States has wanted to hear matter less [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=134.32s)]
*  than their actions. We do know that they are focused on establishing an Islamist state in Syria so [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=137.76s)]
*  there are a lot of unknowns about how they will choose to govern if ultimately this group [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=143.92s)]
*  does take over control of Syria but it is important to note we don't really know who was [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=148.88s)]
*  governing Syria right now. We know Bashar al-Assad is in Russia with his family but it is unclear [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=155.84s)]
*  who is actually calling the shots from Damascus at this moment. Now Sam the U.S. said it carried [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=161.84s)]
*  out airstrikes against ISIS operatives and camps on Sunday. They hit 75 targets and Defense [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=168.0s)]
*  Secretary Lloyd Austin says as the situation in Syria unfolds he said quote there's potential [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=174.32s)]
*  that elements in the area such as ISIS will try to take advantage of this and regain capability. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=180.88s)]
*  Can you talk to us a little bit about that? Well the coalition that led to Assad's ouster was led [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=187.6s)]
*  by Hayat Karir al-Sham but it is composed of a group of different groups so there could be [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=195.92s)]
*  a power vacuum that emerges and no clear power leader in Syria for some time. Basically the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=202.4s)]
*  base on that there are concerns that ISIS could try to take advantage of this moment. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=209.76s)]
*  Now the United States does have about 900 to 1000 troops in Syria that are solely focused on a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=213.92s)]
*  counter-ISIS mission. Their actions have continued unabated as we saw with these 75 strikes over the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=219.2s)]
*  weekend but at the same time there are tens of thousands of ISIS fighters and their families [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  and camps in Syria and there are concerns about the security and stability of those camps based [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=230.24s)]
*  upon the developments in country. So a lot of eyes are on what ISIS chooses to do in this moment [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=236.48s)]
*  and whether the safety and security of these detention camps remains in place based upon the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=242.72s)]
*  shifting dynamics on the ground. I want to ask you about Austin Tice Sam. He's the American [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=247.92s)]
*  journalist and former U.S. Marine who was captured in Syria more than 12 years ago. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=253.2s)]
*  The U.S. says finding him is a top priority. Now that the Assad regime has fallen will it be easier [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=258.32s)]
*  now? The signals we are getting from the White House is that thank God Mr. Tice is alive. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=265.28s)]
*  President Biden indicated yesterday that he is alive and at this point if the opposition groups [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=273.2s)]
*  that have seized power want to cooperate they will work with the United States on finding an [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=278.88s)]
*  exact location. That would certainly be a sign of good faith but the U.S. administration does [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=283.67999999999995s)]
*  sound optimistic about Mr. Tice's well-being thank goodness and about our ability to try to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=288.4s)]
*  bring him home and I imagine despite the leadership transition here in the United States [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=295.12s)]
*  hostage recovery will remain a priority for Mr. Trump just as it did in his first term. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=299.92s)]
*  All right CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd thank you so much Sam. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDQP75LQ_ik&t=305.04s)]
