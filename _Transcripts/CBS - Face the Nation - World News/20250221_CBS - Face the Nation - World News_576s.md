# Margaret Brennan sits down with Hungarian prime minister's political director
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM)
*  For years and years, CPAC was a domestic political event. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=0.0s)]
*  Conservative luminaries, aspiring conservatives, came to deliver remarks at that annual convention [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  here in Washington. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  This year, as in a couple of years past, many leaders from other parts of the world have [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=13.9s)]
*  come to appear. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=18.88s)]
*  And this is the largest, I think, collection. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=19.88s)]
*  Got conservative leaders from the U.K., Spain, Poland, Italy, and many others appearing at [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=21.64s)]
*  this event to burnish their image and their messaging. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=29.2s)]
*  One of them, the political director and adviser to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb치n, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=32.48s)]
*  who took the stage with CPAC chair Matt Schlapp yesterday. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=37.32s)]
*  CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent and Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=41.72s)]
*  sat down with him earlier today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  They began by talking about the growing alliance between conservatives here and in Hungary. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=49.0s)]
*  CPAC is playing a very important role. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=56.64s)]
*  It's growing, and this movement could identify some topics where we share concerns, like [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  in connection with the future of the Western civilization, like migration, gender issues, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=65.44s)]
*  role of Christianity, and so on and so on. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=72.8s)]
*  There was a bit of a scandal. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=76.72s)]
*  Today, the president of the French far-right party national rally, Jordan Bardella, said [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=78.72s)]
*  that he is going to cancel his speech at CPAC after a gesture alluding to Nazi ideology, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=84.28s)]
*  he said, was made that seems to be a reference to what Steve Bannon did when he took the stage. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=90.12s)]
*  How did you interpret what happened? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=97.64s)]
*  Well, in Hungary, and so far as I understood, among the participants, there is zero tolerance [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=100.12s)]
*  on anti-Semitism. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=111.0s)]
*  This is what I was realizing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=113.24s)]
*  And there are some Jewish and Israeli participants also. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=117.88s)]
*  So I don't see the scandal, honestly. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=122.28s)]
*  What did you think Steve Bannon was doing? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=125.83999999999999s)]
*  I think that if those Jewish participants and Israeli participants are saying that there [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=130.04s)]
*  was nothing anti-Semitic, then most probably there wasn't. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=136.92s)]
*  I don't know if you understood. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=141.8s)]
*  But if there was, that would be unacceptable. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=147.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=148.0s)]
*  Trump ally Steve Bannon has called your boss, Viktor Orban, Trump before Trump. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=149.0s)]
*  He has become very influential when it comes to the MAGA movement. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=156.0s)]
*  How do you see Orban and Trump working together? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=162.44s)]
*  Well, President Trump is representing the interest of the United States, and my prime [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  minister represents the interest of Hungary. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=173.28s)]
*  And we have some shared visions, shared problems we want to solve, and we are ready to cooperate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=176.56s)]
*  We mentioned migration, so fighting, pushing back illegal migration. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=184.4s)]
*  That's a top priority for us as well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=189.36s)]
*  Your prime minister has been on social media praising what President Trump has done with [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  USAID, with the international projects that the U.S. supported. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=198.04s)]
*  Elon Musk, of course, has said USAID must be destroyed. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=204.12s)]
*  What do you find so threatening about the U.S. projects in Hungary? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, that's a huge scandal, because American people and American taxpayers' money for [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=212.76s)]
*  used for pushing liberal progressive ideology. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=220.28s)]
*  They were financing the opposition directly and indirectly, opposition media, opposition [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=224.6s)]
*  NGOs. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=232.04s)]
*  And you know, if you're coming from a country which wants to take itself seriously, that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=234.04s)]
*  you cannot allow that politics is financed by a foreign country. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't matter which country it is. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  It's a question of sovereignty, whether you are ready to preserve your sovereignty, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  which means that no foreign funding in politics. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=251.8s)]
*  And this is what they were doing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=256.76s)]
*  And we are very happy that this operation seems to be stopping. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=259.48s)]
*  So USAID in 2022 launched a program to strengthen democracy in Hungary, that's what they called [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=264.36s)]
*  it, and civil society. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=270.44s)]
*  And it included financially supporting independent media in Hungary. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=272.76s)]
*  That's in part because 85% of the media in your country is under government control. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=277.8s)]
*  But it's not true. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=283.8s)]
*  This is a problem. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  It was portrayed as it is kind of a defense for democracy, but in reality, it's just [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=285.88s)]
*  a financial support for those who were opposing the government, because United States previous [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=291.32s)]
*  administration wanted to get rid of the Hungarian government, because we were opposing their [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=298.36s)]
*  war policy, we were not on the same side with the migration policy, and they were used that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=303.32s)]
*  funds to promote the opposition. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=308.76s)]
*  It's not about democracy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=312.2s)]
*  It's always how it is framed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=313.48s)]
*  But everybody knows that it's different. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=316.04s)]
*  So Reporters Without Borders says that FIDEZ, the ruling party that you are part of, controls [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=319.0s)]
*  80% of the country's media. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=324.76s)]
*  The State Department during Donald Trump estimated approximately 85% of all Hungarian media outlets [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  are under the control of a government-friendly owner. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=335.24s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not true. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=338.2s)]
*  The Trump administration was wrong about that? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=339.4s)]
*  We have a wonderful, yeah, probably the deep state was providing this information, false [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=342.44s)]
*  information for the president. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=347.56s)]
*  So it's like Hungarian language is a unique language. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=350.28s)]
*  It's a small market. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=353.96s)]
*  12 million people, the country itself, it's 10 million. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=355.24s)]
*  So it's very hard to follow how it's going on. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=358.68s)]
*  But if you come from Hungary, you follow the Hungarian media environment, it's obvious [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=360.68s)]
*  that the pro-governmental and anti-governmental or critical voices are very loudly heard. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=366.6s)]
*  It's much better and healthier environment than in many other Western countries. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=373.56s)]
*  So this is the reality. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=379.64000000000004s)]
*  Every voice can be heard in Hungary. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=381.08000000000004s)]
*  The U.S. money was specifically to try to delegitimize the current government. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=383.8s)]
*  And I think it's unacceptable. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=391.24s)]
*  Margaret Brennan joins me here at the table. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=394.44s)]
*  Margaret, that's quite an accusation from Orban's top political adviser. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=396.44s)]
*  It is. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=401.08000000000004s)]
*  It also tracks the things that Vladimir Putin has said. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=402.04s)]
*  Hungary's government very friendly with the Russian government. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=405.56s)]
*  But these accusations about what the State Department USAID have done is interesting [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=408.68s)]
*  because it's characterized as part by Orban of this international conservative movement. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=416.44s)]
*  And when you hear that there is a connection between ideology and media coverage and that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=423.32s)]
*  kind of language that they're using there, it deserves further digging in. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=432.36s)]
*  And that's why I cited back the Reporters Without Borders stats, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=437.72s)]
*  Committee to Protect Journalists. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=441.16s)]
*  The Trump Justice Department, State Department numbers, 85 percent. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=442.44000000000005s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=445.96000000000004s)]
*  And so there is this tendency within Hungary, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=446.68s)]
*  repeatedly under the Orban government, whether it's media or whether it's the university, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=449.8s)]
*  something that JD Vance, the vice president, has praised. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=453.24s)]
*  Viktor Orban has consolidated control by bringing control of those entities [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=455.8s)]
*  into the arms or boards of groups that his cronies are on. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=462.12s)]
*  So it may not be directly under control of the state, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=466.52s)]
*  but it's under control of boards of directors manned by his cronies. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=469.88s)]
*  And that is whether it's the media or whether it's the universities. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=473.96s)]
*  So I wanted to dig into this, you know, exactly what the thinking is, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=477.08s)]
*  because I find this idea that this is a global movement really interesting, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  particularly when we hear conservative leaders in this country praise Viktor Orban. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=485.56s)]
*  And it comes down to a definition of what is free speech and how loudly people can be heard. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=489.8s)]
*  And if you have 80 to 85 percent of the media in your country and you're the government, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=495.08s)]
*  and it's generally aligned with you, and there are some voices that can be heard, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=499.96s)]
*  you're probably very happy that voices can be heard. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=503.4s)]
*  It's all about proportion and definition. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=507.8s)]
*  It is. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=509.88s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=510.44s)]
*  I mean, we're having this ongoing debate over what free speech and censorship is [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=511.64s)]
*  in the context of where it's said and how it's said matters, clearly. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=515.48s)]
*  Viktor Orban also rewrote the Constitution when he came to power. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=518.76s)]
*  So he has redefined a lot of these things and done so with the judiciary. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=521.88s)]
*  So I think it deserves a second look when we see some of these international leaders appear [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=525.48s)]
*  at CPAC, whether it's here in Washington or the next conference major, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=530.2s)]
*  which is actually going to be in Budapest in May. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxDEeLkKEXM&t=533.72s)]
