# How a group of veterans helped a U.S. service member's mother get out of war-torn Gaza
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [May 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8)
*  On this Mother's Day, we have a story from Gaza that's unlike any we've heard before. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=0.0s)]
*  Zara Skake, a 44-year-old Palestinian woman living in Gaza City, escaped the war thanks [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=6.72s)]
*  to her American sons, one of whom is an army specialist. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=12.68s)]
*  Some of the things Zara has to say about how Hamas and the Israeli army have been treating [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=17.64s)]
*  civilians are hard to hear, and even harder to confirm as the fighting continues and foreign [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  journalists are largely barred from the area. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=28.48s)]
*  But Zara's story, unlike so many that we're learning about from this region, does have [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=31.16s)]
*  a somewhat happy ending. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=37.52s)]
*  We sat down with her last month, and Zara told us she left Gaza in late December with [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=39.9s)]
*  nothing but a small backpack and the same clothes she'd been wearing since the war began. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=45.88s)]
*  You didn't bring anything from your home with you? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=52.92s)]
*  No, it's, you know, if it's not, you know, damaged, it's burned. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=55.72s)]
*  And there was, you couldn't salvage anything? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=60.32s)]
*  I mean, if you got out alive, it's like a big thing for you, yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=63.56s)]
*  In 1998, Zara Skake and her husband Abdullah moved from Gaza to the U.S., where their three [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=69.4s)]
*  sons were born. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=75.24s)]
*  Ten years later, the family returned to Gaza City. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=77.12s)]
*  As their sons grew from little boys to young men, all three decided to live in the U.S., [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=80.48s)]
*  while Zara and Abdullah remained in Gaza City. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=86.2s)]
*  After Hamas's brutal attack on Israel on October 7th, Israel struck back and ordered over a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=90.76s)]
*  million Palestinians in northern Gaza to head south as it prepared for a ground invasion. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=98.16s)]
*  Why didn't you leave? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=104.16s)]
*  There's no place to go there. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=105.64s)]
*  We're going to just live on the street, you know? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we don't have anything to do with the Hamas, so we'll be safe. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=108.96s)]
*  We know that every war, it comes and past, like, you know, just a period of time. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=114.72s)]
*  We don't know that this is going to be different. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=119.88s)]
*  Israeli forces invaded Gaza in late October. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=123.24s)]
*  By mid-November, they were getting close to Zara's home. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=126.36s)]
*  One day, from the window of her building, Zara says she saw at least four pedestrians [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  and two cars carrying families blown up without warning as they tried to cross the street. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=135.72s)]
*  And we tried to scream from the window, tell them, no, don't pass this line. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=142.68s)]
*  He didn't even hear us. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=147.3s)]
*  He just passed and right away, you know, blow up. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=148.68s)]
*  And all the body like that, it was full of the car, and it have a lot of, like, mattresses [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=151.92s)]
*  and like that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=158.24s)]
*  They're moving, like, these seams. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=159.24s)]
*  And the woman just came, like, with all her, like, her body, like, full of blood. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=160.4s)]
*  She's only one alive between her kids and the driver and like that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=166.44s)]
*  She started screaming and telling everybody, kill me, like, again. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=170.6s)]
*  Kill me with my kids and with my family. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=173.68s)]
*  Just to be clear, because intentionally firing on civilians with children could be a war [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=176.36s)]
*  crime. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=183.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=184.32s)]
*  Do you believe that was deliberate? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=185.32s)]
*  Is that what you were saying? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=188.72s)]
*  Because, I mean, pretty much happened in front of me like that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=191.12s)]
*  Is it possible it was a mistake? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=193.92s)]
*  How come if it's a mistake from, like, one part, what about the others? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=198.0s)]
*  Civilian just walking, two women just walking by, one boy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  Come on, like, you know, there's something, like, wrong about it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=209.24s)]
*  When asked about Zahra's account, the Israel Defense Forces replied, quote, the IDF is [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=213.74s)]
*  not at war with civilians in Gaza. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=219.32000000000002s)]
*  The IDF is at war with Hamas. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  Hamas has embedded itself in civilian infrastructure. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  The area referred to as an active combat zone and in order to mitigate harm to civilians, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  an evacuation was carried out. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=232.84s)]
*  At her home that evening, Zahra says gunfire shattered the windows and shells hit the building. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=235.56s)]
*  With all this, like, noise and with the shells start one after one like that, we just start [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=241.08s)]
*  to crawl down, downstairs, just go down the first floor and hid somewhere. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=247.64s)]
*  You and your husband? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=254.72s)]
*  While we're crawling down, it's like the shooting didn't stop and the shells, like, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=255.72s)]
*  one after one like that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=260.88s)]
*  And you feel your house start to burn, you know, because, I mean, everything is hot around [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=263.52s)]
*  you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=268.0s)]
*  You can't even touch anything. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=269.0s)]
*  The bomb kept going until the second day in the morning. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=270.0s)]
*  You know, my husband started to, like, to fade because, I mean, his diabetic, his sugar [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=273.52s)]
*  was low and like that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=277.96s)]
*  So you know, something's going to happen to him if I didn't get him out. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=280.0s)]
*  But that's the, you know, the main thing, I couldn't get out like that, you know, because, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=285.32s)]
*  I mean, all the rocks like that, it covered the exit where we're, like, hidden. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=291.08s)]
*  So that what took me, like, a while, like, to get out. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=298.36s)]
*  And it was three days past. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=302.92s)]
*  You were three days under the rubble. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's like a miracle, I swear, like, you know. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  What happened to us, it's like you felt like, like you died and you just went back to life [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=312.68s)]
*  again. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=319.32s)]
*  With help from a neighbor, Abdullah walked with Zara to this building owned by his family. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=320.32s)]
*  In the lower level of a weightlifting center called the Super Gym, Abdullah's brother and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=325.68s)]
*  dozens of other relatives were taking shelter in a space with no electricity or running [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=330.56s)]
*  water and one bathroom. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=335.44s)]
*  It was here that Zara discovered Abdullah's foot had been injured during the attack on [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=338.04s)]
*  their home. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=342.04s)]
*  He was shivering from what appeared to be an infection. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=343.32s)]
*  Due to fighting, it was days before she could get to a hospital. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=346.6s)]
*  At the hospital, there were no antibiotics? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=350.36s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=352.56s)]
*  No painkillers? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=353.64s)]
*  No. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=354.64s)]
*  They gave you nothing? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=355.64s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=356.64s)]
*  Because they had nothing? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=357.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=358.64s)]
*  Al Ahly Arab Hospital was overwhelmed with patients. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=359.64s)]
*  While we're like waiting to get him into the operation, he passed away like while he was [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=363.76s)]
*  sitting down. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=371.64s)]
*  Waiting for the surgery? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=372.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=374.64s)]
*  I couldn't believe it at first. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=375.64s)]
*  The doctors kept talking. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=376.8s)]
*  They told me you should be happy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=378.68s)]
*  And I said, like, why? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=380.2s)]
*  I mean, why you're sitting like all that? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=381.64s)]
*  He said, because, I mean, he passed here in the hospital, not in the street like others. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=383.44s)]
*  So you should be happy. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=390.24s)]
*  I didn't understand that he's gone or, you know. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=393.44s)]
*  Because I mean, he's the only one for me in Gaza. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=398.48s)]
*  And I felt that loneliness. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=401.6s)]
*  It's just like, oh, what's going to happen to me? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=403.4s)]
*  So I started to hit him, I swear. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  You hit the doctor? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=411.44s)]
*  Because of what he was saying? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=413.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=414.4s)]
*  Because he was telling you, you were lucky. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=415.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=416.4s)]
*  He just said, I'll let the people just come and pick him up. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=417.4s)]
*  But I couldn't let go like that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=421.4s)]
*  I kept holding him. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  And everybody said, let go. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=428.32s)]
*  I couldn't let go that easy like that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=430.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  At that point, Zahra's eldest son Fadi was living in California. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=437.79999999999995s)]
*  He'd been struggling to stay in touch with his parents. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=442.0s)]
*  When you think about that last time you were able to speak to your father, do you remember [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=444.8s)]
*  a lot of it? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=451.04s)]
*  I don't think I'll ever forget it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=452.04s)]
*  He was, you know, screaming on the phone, you know, begging for mercy. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=453.92s)]
*  Did you ever say goodbye to your father? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=460.96s)]
*  Fadi had been in touch with the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem to help get his parents out of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=468.64s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  He was told the U.S. would try to get them permission to leave Gaza through the Rafah [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=474.2s)]
*  crossing in the south, but could not help them travel through the war zone to get there. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=478.76s)]
*  That's a very frustrating thing to be told by the most powerful government in the world. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=484.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=488.64s)]
*  I can't help you. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=489.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=490.64s)]
*  And I mean... [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=491.64s)]
*  As an American citizen. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=492.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=493.64s)]
*  His father's death made him more determined to help his mother. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=494.64s)]
*  After he passed, I knew that, you know, nothing matters more, like, to me than saving my mother [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=498.2s)]
*  from there, because honestly, she did not deserve to go through that. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=504.96s)]
*  I should have been the one there. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=509.76s)]
*  Back at the super gym, roughly a week after her husband died, Zahra says two armed men [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=512.72s)]
*  she believed to be from Hamas killed three Palestinian women when civilians sheltering [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=518.4s)]
*  there defied the men's orders to leave. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=523.64s)]
*  It was like, you know, didn't believe what happened exactly like that. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=526.52s)]
*  It's just like, even if it happened in front of you, they said if we're like, if they're [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=530.92s)]
*  Israeli and people, yeah, like, we can believe it like that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=535.92s)]
*  But they're one of us, like, you know, where they're Palestinian like us, like, they're [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=540.8s)]
*  doing this. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=545.76s)]
*  In an interview, the owner of the super gym denied that the incident happened there. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=547.0s)]
*  So did a Hamas spokesman who told us, quote, Hamas has never attacked civilians. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=551.68s)]
*  Hamas says it is fighting for the Palestinian people. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  Islamic Jihad says they are fighting for the Palestinian people. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=562.1999999999999s)]
*  Did you see from what you witnessed, any help being given by these groups to the Palestinian [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=567.4799999999999s)]
*  people? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=575.68s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=576.68s)]
*  I swear. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=577.68s)]
*  I swear. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=578.68s)]
*  It's like they're careless about their people. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=579.68s)]
*  Increasingly desperate to get his mother out of Gaza, Fadi turned to the Michigan-based [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=582.56s)]
*  Arab-American Civil Rights League. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=587.5999999999999s)]
*  Our calls, our emails are of this, the most incredibly sad stories that you could imagine [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=589.76s)]
*  from Americans talking about their family who are in war, in active live combat. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=595.8399999999999s)]
*  One of their attorneys, Alicia Nieves, first learned about Zara's case in mid-December. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=601.1999999999999s)]
*  How many Palestinian Americans that you know of are in a position like Fadi, where they're [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=606.54s)]
*  trying to get loved ones out now? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=612.66s)]
*  There are thousands right now that are trying to. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=615.6999999999999s)]
*  Still. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=617.5799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=618.5799999999999s)]
*  What struck me about Fadi's case was that it said that his brother was an active US [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=619.5799999999999s)]
*  military member. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=623.42s)]
*  And I thought at that moment, there was a possibility that something impossible could [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=625.0s)]
*  happen, which is we can actually get somebody from northern Gaza. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=629.8199999999999s)]
*  Why do you think the fact that his brother was active duty army made a difference? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=633.54s)]
*  Because I had experience in a previous conflict where I was introduced to military veterans [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=639.6999999999999s)]
*  that were demonstrating a willingness and a capability to extract people from active [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=646.5s)]
*  conflict zones. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=653.74s)]
*  I knew this was a time to make a call to the veterans that I knew to see if there was any [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=654.74s)]
*  way that they could help in this situation. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=660.04s)]
*  When we come back, how a team of special operations veterans got Zara Skake out of Gaza. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=663.02s)]
*  Attorney Alicia Nieves connected with the Special Operations Association of America, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=673.78s)]
*  an organization made up of former military and intelligence professionals who have experience [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=678.98s)]
*  volunteering to help civilians get out of conflict zones, including Afghanistan and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=684.18s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=690.34s)]
*  But Gaza posed some unusual challenges, especially the part of Gaza City where Zara Skake was [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=691.7s)]
*  struggling to survive. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=698.0600000000001s)]
*  But the rescue team started planning and Fadi got through to his mother to help tell her [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=700.4200000000001s)]
*  help is on the way. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=706.4200000000001s)]
*  In December, Zara Skake sent this photo of herself to her eldest son Fadi, who told her [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=709.26s)]
*  a group of people she'd never met needed it to identify her and rescue her from Gaza City. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=714.1800000000001s)]
*  You must have thought that's impossible. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=721.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=722.56s)]
*  But when I saw the first message from Brian, yeah, this is one of the team. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=723.56s)]
*  In that minute, I start to believe. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=731.4s)]
*  Alex Plitsis is a member of the Special Operations Association team that took on Zara's case. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=734.8s)]
*  So what was the situation on the ground when you began planning this escape? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=740.18s)]
*  How intense was it? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=744.86s)]
*  It was extremely intense. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=746.0s)]
*  At that point, Zara was trapped behind Hamas lines in an enclave in northern Gaza, so it [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=747.84s)]
*  was an active combat zone. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=752.36s)]
*  Plitsis is an Army combat veteran and former counterterrorism official at the Pentagon. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=754.12s)]
*  He worked with former Green Berets, intelligence professionals and a Marine fluent in Arabic, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=759.44s)]
*  all of whom were eager to help Zara's middle son. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=765.32s)]
*  Raji Skake, a 24-year-old Army specialist who was serving in Korea while his mother [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=769.04s)]
*  was in Gaza. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=774.66s)]
*  And so for us, it felt kind of personal. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=775.98s)]
*  We just pictured ourselves in those shoes. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=777.62s)]
*  So why can't the U.S. government do what you're doing? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=779.36s)]
*  There are no U.S. government employees of any kind, either military or civilian, on [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=782.34s)]
*  the ground inside Gaza. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=786.94s)]
*  Having had experience in this type of work in government and understanding what the legalities [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=788.3000000000001s)]
*  are, we're kind of able to step into the void and try to set it up the right way. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=792.86s)]
*  The group of special operators came together quickly in December. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=797.0600000000001s)]
*  My mother, she's just afraid. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=800.58s)]
*  Just days before, Fadi Skake had made a very public plea for his mother on U.S. television. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=803.46s)]
*  Every awakening second, it's hard to imagine losing her. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=809.58s)]
*  Things started to fall into place around Christmas. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=814.2s)]
*  Top officials at the State Department reached out to Israeli and Egyptian officials to secure [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=817.9000000000001s)]
*  their support for the special operations team to carry out the mission. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=823.1s)]
*  The Israeli military, just to be clear, had to help you get Zara out of Gaza. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=827.46s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=833.14s)]
*  We did need help from the Israeli government for approval to move inside of North Gaza [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=834.14s)]
*  because it can be incredibly dangerous when you try to operate as an independent actor, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=839.54s)]
*  especially in a war zone. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=843.3s)]
*  So can you tell us some of the options you considered? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=844.98s)]
*  Everything was on the table in terms of options to get them out. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=848.3199999999999s)]
*  Hamas still had shoulder-fired RPGs or small arms fire like AK-47s that could have hit [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=850.34s)]
*  helicopters and that type of rescue really wasn't feasible. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=856.3s)]
*  And then you look at maritime options, can you come in over the beach? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=859.78s)]
*  And you realize as you start to move through, you have to eliminate some of these options [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=862.18s)]
*  that are not realistic. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=866.14s)]
*  In this case, was someone driving up a car, a vehicle of some sort, to move her around? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=867.6s)]
*  That was really the only realistic option, but you can imagine trying to get cars and [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=872.34s)]
*  fuel inside Gaza is difficult. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=875.9s)]
*  Using satellite imagery and coordinating with multiple governments, the team of operators [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=877.9399999999999s)]
*  carefully planned the mission. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=882.66s)]
*  I was operating from an encrypted chat platform sitting in my living room in Connecticut. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=884.22s)]
*  My other teammates were kind of spread around the U.S. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=888.98s)]
*  But collectively, we worked our government contacts and they stepped in and helped. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=891.26s)]
*  But they called off the rescue twice because conditions on the ground weren't right. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=894.7s)]
*  This is crazy making. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=899.46s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=901.62s)]
*  You're getting all excited and nervous and then nothing happens. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=903.8199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=909.06s)]
*  But they kept me like really like strong like that. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=910.06s)]
*  Just telling you that I'm going to take care of you like, you know, just no panic. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=913.58s)]
*  I believe it from the first time like that. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=919.38s)]
*  They will do something. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=922.3s)]
*  They care about you. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=923.3s)]
*  You know, these are people you never met. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=924.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=927.26s)]
*  Thousands of miles away. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=928.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=929.74s)]
*  Who are trying to help get you out. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=930.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=931.74s)]
*  You see, it's like words like can like express how much you know you need to thank them. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=932.74s)]
*  When people hear the term special operators, they think of some out of the movie action [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=939.8s)]
*  scene. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=946.7s)]
*  Is that what we should be picturing here in North Gaza? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=947.82s)]
*  People have seen too many movies. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=951.4200000000001s)]
*  They're thinking, you know, you're going to see G.I. Joe show up in a giant truck. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=952.4200000000001s)]
*  What you need are people who can blend into the area. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=955.34s)]
*  So local, national, Palestinian Arabs who speak Arabic with a Gazan accent who are have [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=957.5s)]
*  a reason to be where they're supposed to be and everything else is really what you kind [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=962.5400000000001s)]
*  of need there to be quiet. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=965.3000000000001s)]
*  That was who was at the heart of the operation. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=966.38s)]
*  A network of trusted drivers got Zara Schake and her brother-in-law, who's a U.S. citizen, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=968.1800000000001s)]
*  out of Gaza City and all the way to Rafa. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=973.5200000000001s)]
*  What are you seeing as you're driving through North Gaza? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=976.62s)]
*  You don't know that this is Gaza or somewhere else. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=980.26s)]
*  Like you know, there's no street, there's no buildings. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=984.46s)]
*  You know, it's like all destroyed. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=987.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=989.42s)]
*  Gaza was like not Gaza anymore. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=990.42s)]
*  On December 31st, Zara Schake made it through the Rafa crossing into Egypt, where U.S. officials [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=993.42s)]
*  met her and expedited a green card for her. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=999.34s)]
*  Fadi met her in Cairo. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1003.02s)]
*  You could just tell by looking at her, she's been through hell. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1004.7s)]
*  Like I could literally see her bones and it was very visible and that was just, you know, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1011.5s)]
*  I didn't know what to say. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1022.0200000000001s)]
*  But it was a very happy moment for me just to be able to be next to her and to know that [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1025.3s)]
*  she's safe. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1032.82s)]
*  By February, Zara Schake and her sons were reunited in the U.S. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1034.9s)]
*  This is the first Mother's Day in 10 years that she'll spend with all three of them. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1040.5s)]
*  So if Zara's son hadn't been in the U.S. Army, what would have happened to Zara? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1045.14s)]
*  She'd still be stuck in North Gaza, along with a number of other folks, with no means [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1050.7s)]
*  of getting south, no food, no water, no access to medicine. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1054.54s)]
*  And whether she would still be alive at the moment, I simply couldn't tell you. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1058.3400000000001s)]
*  We were able to confirm aspects of Zara's story through relatives, photos and published [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1061.7s)]
*  accounts. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1066.46s)]
*  But with the war still raging, we could not find a second witness to the incidents in [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1068.5s)]
*  which she describes what sound like war crimes against civilians committed by both the Israeli [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1074.56s)]
*  Army and Hamas. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1080.38s)]
*  There are parts of what Zara shared with us that are very hard to confirm. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1082.14s)]
*  Do you think she's telling us the truth? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1089.1s)]
*  I find Zara to be a wonderful human being. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1092.1799999999998s)]
*  I think she's a person of integrity. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1094.82s)]
*  And I think for me to second guess her or the Israelis or Hamas or any of them, I would [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1096.3s)]
*  be speculating because I wasn't there. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1100.26s)]
*  But I certainly don't find her to be somebody who's less than truthful. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1102.1799999999998s)]
*  What do you hope people at home who hear your story understand about Gaza? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1105.54s)]
*  We're not just a number, you know. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1113.4599999999998s)]
*  We're like a human being like that. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1115.86s)]
*  I mean, we like deserve like better life. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1118.54s)]
*  The people like over Gaza. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1123.06s)]
*  I mean, it's not their choice to go through this war. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1126.06s)]
*  State Department officials say that so far they've helped get 1800 people out of Gaza, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1131.54s)]
*  most of them U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1137.14s)]
*  U.S. officials tell CBS News that there are, quote, active interagency conversations about [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1140.8600000000001s)]
*  what more the U.S. can do to help the Palestinian people caught in the crossfire like Zara [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1146.78s)]
*  Skake. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1153.26s)]
*  We want to thank two of our 60 Minutes colleagues, producers Andy Kort and Annabel Hanflig for [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1154.26s)]
*  their help getting this story on our broadcast. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1159.34s)]
*  And we also want to thank Face the Nation producer Richard Escobedo and editor Matt [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnD_0irdX8&t=1162.46s)]
