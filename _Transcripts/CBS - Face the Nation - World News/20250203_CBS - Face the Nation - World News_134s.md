**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo)
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio is pressing forward with his first international trip [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=0.0s)]
*  since being sworn into office. His first stop was in Panama, where he told the president there his [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=3.84s)]
*  country must reduce China's influence over the canal. The critical waterway is responsible for [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=8.48s)]
*  removing roughly 40 percent of the world's cargo traffic. The Trump administration says China's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=14.08s)]
*  influence poses a threat to economic security and global trade. CBS News senior White House [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=19.12s)]
*  and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe is there. So Ed, how is the trip going and what are officials [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=23.76s)]
*  in Panama saying in response to his visit? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=28.48s)]
*  Lindsay, good to be with you. This is the second full day of essentially a week-long trip across [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=34.0s)]
*  Central America and the Caribbean for Secretary Rubio, making his first overseas mission, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  one, to the Western Hemisphere. It began Sunday here in Panama with a warning to officials here [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=44.32s)]
*  that they, the United States, believes there's been too much increased influence of China along [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=49.68s)]
*  the Panama Canal. And if that continues, the U.S. may need to take steps subject to that treaty [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=54.64s)]
*  signed by Jimmy Carter back in the day that would in essence allow the United States to retake [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=59.52s)]
*  control. Now, shortly after his meeting with the Panamanian president, Panama's leader announced [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=63.68s)]
*  that Panama would be ending its partnership with China and its Belt and Road Initiative, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=68.64s)]
*  major global infrastructure project that's been used to curry favor with countries across the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Third World. And that was seen as an encouraging sign for the Trump administration, though the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=79.84s)]
*  president earlier today back in Washington suggested that he will be speaking with [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=84.4s)]
*  Panamanian leadership later this week. Since then, Rubio has gone to Costa Rica and is now in El [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  Salvador. He's set to meet with that country's president later today, President Bukele, a bit of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  a well-known figure across Latin America and credited by many for his get tough on crime and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=97.84s)]
*  drug gangs approach. There's been reporting by CBS News and other outlets that we may get word [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  of a new third country agreement between the United States and El Salvador that would have [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=109.44s)]
*  that country accept violent undocumented immigrants to be potentially imprisoned in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=114.0s)]
*  El Salvador's notorious prisons. And then also asylum seekers would be sent to El Salvador [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=119.68s)]
*  and told to apply for asylum from that country and await any response from the United States [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=124.88s)]
*  from there. Lindsay. Ed O'Keefe, thank you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8QemCc9gZo&t=130.96s)]
