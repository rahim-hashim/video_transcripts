# CBS News producer describes scene in Gaza: "I saw death, bodies, everywhere"
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas)
*  CBS News producer Marwan Alhul lives in Gaza, and he joins us by phone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=0.0s)]
*  Marwan, I know it's difficult to communicate with the outside world right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=5.8s)]
*  What can you tell us about what has changed since Israel expanded its operations in Gaza? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=11.38s)]
*  Well, first of all, once communication was cut, it was miserable life. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=19.68s)]
*  It was miserable before, but now it's more and more. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=29.2s)]
*  The worst thing, as no communication, once there is a strike and cause death of people, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=33.0s)]
*  injuries, nobody can call the ambulances, nobody can call the field defense. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=46.6s)]
*  Even the people themselves don't know who got dead or who got injured. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=53.12s)]
*  So it was really terrible life in case of cut all of the communication in Gaza. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=59.72s)]
*  Today morning I was driving from Rafah city in the south toward the north of Gaza. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=67.52s)]
*  In Gaza city, I saw empty streets, but a lot of destruction everywhere. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=76.04s)]
*  Are there any safe zones, Marwan? Is there any place safe to take shelter? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately not. There is no any safe place in Gaza. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  But so many displaced people went to another school, which is full of thousands and thousands [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  and they live miserable life in these schools. No enough water, no enough food, no place to sleep. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=104.8s)]
*  It's not healthy at all. It's very difficult to describe how the people who [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=114.6s)]
*  displaced in another school live in. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=121.64s)]
*  The United Nations said that order is beginning to break down, that people are panicking. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=124.36s)]
*  They are running low on food, on water, on basic supplies. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=131.64s)]
*  That's right. Today morning I saw people went to the United Nations stores and they break the doors [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  and took out some food like wheat and some water. It is not enough, but the people broke the gates [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=150.2s)]
*  and the siege of Anorwa and took the food over there. The people are hungry. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=161.08s)]
*  You need to lie a few hours to get bread, which is the most kind of food people need. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  It's really miserable. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  What about medical supplies, Marwan? Are the hospitals full? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=183.88000000000002s)]
*  What are you seeing in terms of who is being injured right now? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=188.04s)]
*  Yesterday I was in the hospital, which is the biggest one in Gaza. First of all, all of the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  beds, medical beds, are full of inside the departments, emergency departments, ICU, are [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=202.28s)]
*  all full. They keep the most dangerous inside and they release the others outside of the hospital [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=209.4s)]
*  in the garden. I saw tents full of injuries and some of them even in dangerous cases. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=218.44s)]
*  The medical beds are outside of the hospital. Some patients and some wounded people lie on the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=227.72s)]
*  ground. It's very difficult to describe. Anyhow, the medical sector in Gaza is almost collapsed. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=236.84s)]
*  It's very difficult to make operations. The number of doctors is few numbers in the normal time, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=247.96s)]
*  but now dozens come to the hospital at one time, at once. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=257.32s)]
*  Marwan, you've seen a lot of conflict in Gaza over the years. I wonder how you would describe [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=262.44s)]
*  what's happening now versus past conflict in Gaza. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=269.64s)]
*  I have been covering the conflict since 1988, but till now. I have never so covered such a war. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=276.12s)]
*  It's horrible. Before this war, I mean, about the war in 2014, the Israeli army used to send [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  message warning to the people to leave the house before they destroy it. Now they don't send any [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=305.0s)]
*  warning. Just suddenly, they strike the house, killing all of the people inside. So this is [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=311.8s)]
*  different, completely different from any other war before in Gaza. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=317.88s)]
*  Marwan Al Ghul, CBS producer living in Gaza. Marwan, please stay safe. Please keep your family safe. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=322.52s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smKaxUoJas&t=330.2s)]
