# Face The Nation: Tracy, Krebs, McMasters, Crawford
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk)
*  We now turn to our senior national and environmental correspondent Ben Tracy. Good morning to you. Good morning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=0.0s)]
*  So Ben we hear Florida's governor DeSantis say things like this is a 500 year flood event [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=6.44s)]
*  They've never experienced anything like this. What's making the storm hit differently? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=12.48s)]
*  Well, I think we have to look at this in the context of climate change and we should say first off that climate change doesn't cause [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=17.56s)]
*  A hurricane to happen but scientists increasingly [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=22.86s)]
*  believe that climate change is making hurricanes stronger and more destructive and the reason for that is pretty simple [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=25.72s)]
*  It's that the ocean waters are much warmer than they used to be and warm ocean water is rocket fuel for a hurricane [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=32.16s)]
*  So when one of these storms passes over this warm water, it just turbocharges this thing and it's what they call rapid [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=38.0s)]
*  Intensification and we're seeing this more often. They actually believe since 2017 [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  We've had about 30 storms that have rapidly intensified right before they hit the coast and that's a huge issue for people in these coastal [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Communities because they don't have as much time to prepare for that and in addition to all of that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=55.12s)]
*  Climate change is making the atmosphere warmer and that means there's more water [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=59.8s)]
*  So there's more rain when these storms hit and that leads to flooding so taxpayers just invested this [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=63.44s)]
*  Historic amount of money in trying to control climate change. That's what President Biden sold it as and Democrats supported [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=70.28s)]
*  You also have FEMA sending a record three and a half billion to states to help lessen disaster impact [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=79.0s)]
*  Is this record investment going where the scientists say it needs to go? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=85.34s)]
*  well [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=89.72s)]
*  The scientists would say that any money that is spent to more quickly wean us off of fossil fuels to transition us to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=90.16s)]
*  Renewable forms of energy is where the money is best spent [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=96.2s)]
*  Of course, if you're the government you also know that you have to deal with disasters when they happen and the impacts those are [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=99.2s)]
*  Having on people and property so they're trying to do both things here, but you talk about the historic investment [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=104.83999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is about three hundred seventy billion dollars for climate initiatives [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  But a very small amount of that only about four billion to five billion is going for what they call climate resilience [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=113.78s)]
*  So this would go to help some of these coastal communities [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=118.96s)]
*  Rebuild wetlands build sea walls the kinds of things that you need for protection [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  But scientists will say as long as we keep burning fossil fuels, we're just digging a hole and we're making that hole bigger [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=126.56s)]
*  So that's where the money needs to be spent [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=132.18s)]
*  That's why you hear a lot about [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=134.22s)]
*  Some of the renewable energy provisions of this the electric car credits the things that we can do in our own homes to stop using [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=135.46s)]
*  fossil fuels [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=142.26s)]
*  And that's an important part of this story [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=143.58s)]
*  But again immediate versus long-term exactly and you're gonna see projects all over this country where they're building massive [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=146.66s)]
*  Infrastructure projects to try to defend the coast [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  but the one thing most people never want to talk about is a phenomenon called managed retreat and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=156.58s)]
*  This is not something Americans like to hear but it's this issue of should we be rebuilding in these areas? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=161.66s)]
*  That are prone to get hit over and over again. And at what point does that just become financially irresponsible? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=167.17999999999998s)]
*  If you can't get insurance in these areas, so you then have people who lose their homes their businesses and they're just left flat broke [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=173.22s)]
*  And that's a question for any governor in coastal communities been great context [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=179.78s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us and we'll be right back with a lot more face the nation. Stay with us [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=185.26s)]
*  You [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=192.54s)]
*  Welcome back to face the nation [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=194.54s)]
*  We're joined now by the former director of the cyber security and infrastructure security agency Chris Krebs. Good morning [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=195.66s)]
*  Good to have you here in person morning [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=201.42s)]
*  I want to ask you first about hurricane [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=203.42s)]
*  Response because you were involved back in 2017 with the response to Hurricane Maria, which just devastated Puerto Rico [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=207.14s)]
*  What are the biggest challenges you see right now both for that island and for this devastation in Florida? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=213.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think the the first issue is the devastation as you mentioned what structures what communities can actually take power [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=220.06s)]
*  I think in general and speaking with the power restoration task forces [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=226.9s)]
*  They've done a good job of marshaling resources getting linemen and crews down into the areas that can actually be restored [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=230.54s)]
*  But as you heard from the mayor and the administrator there are areas that simply just cannot take [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=236.86s)]
*  Power right now and it's going to take time to evaluate [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=243.3s)]
*  See if they're condemned or otherwise and so but again that you know [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=246.34s)]
*  The power teams have done a good job in Florida and they've actually I think done a good job in Puerto Rico as well after [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=250.26000000000002s)]
*  Fiona when you're looking at you know, ten days after Fiona 90% of the power is restored in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=255.78s)]
*  Maria that took about seven months and they're still in many ways on the recovery track for Maria [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=262.54s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think over the last few years they have done a better job of management of investment and of maintenance [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=269.06s)]
*  But now they're at a position where I think they have to think about upgrading the system [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=275.7s)]
*  They're still a fairly antiquated older system and they do have to kind of move forward with that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=279.26s)]
*  I want to ask you about infrastructure beyond hurricane [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=283.46s)]
*  Of course, we are what 36 days from the midterms you have large displacement now people in Florida [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=286.94s)]
*  Is that going to have an impact on the ability to carry out? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=293.09999999999997s)]
*  Elections there are plans in place and you know, we heard the senator talk about Hurricane Michael from 2018 [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=295.82s)]
*  Which Mexico Beach was devastated there are rules and and systems in place that allow for [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=302.9s)]
*  Some flexibility and how the elections are conducted and they will ensure that those that want to vote can vote [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=308.7s)]
*  If I've seen anything its election officials are natural crisis managers and really good at the resilient side of it [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=314.34s)]
*  Well, they have to be right now getting all the pressures on them [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=320.08s)]
*  Switching to the cyber front so you were in office during the midterms in [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=324.53999999999996s)]
*  2018 and cyber command was pretty explicit that they went on the offense [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=330.06s)]
*  To protect our midterm races at that time [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=335.78s)]
*  Taking out Russian operatives to deter spreading disinformation [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=339.21999999999997s)]
*  We know they're watching what's happening this year [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  What does that look like? What is protecting our election against foreign interference look like? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=347.9s)]
*  Well, you know as I look at the concerns around the 2022 midterm elections [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=352.82s)]
*  I have three primary areas of you know [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=357.46000000000004s)]
*  focus first is the continued domestic efforts to undermine the process attack workers the second is this increase in insider risk and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=360.18s)]
*  As that all kind of manifests in political instability here domestically it gives a lot of opportunity and attack surface [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=368.5s)]
*  For the bad guys we've seen over the last couple years the foreign actors that is we've seen the Iranians [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=375.74s)]
*  We've seen the Russians and even recently we've seen the Chinese start to take some of the Russian plans [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=381.54s)]
*  And it's almost Russification of Chinese information operations. So what I would look at is more, you know plagiarizing [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=386.48s)]
*  domestic issues and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=395.0s)]
*  Driving wedges into the discourse here in the US probably not manufacturing [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=397.32s)]
*  New narratives or anything like that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  But instead really hitting on the issues that we're already talking about here and just making them that much more heated [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=403.92s)]
*  Meta took down a small Chinese network trying to influence [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=409.76s)]
*  Elections this is the Facebook sphere, right? Is that the prime platform for disinformation? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=413.8s)]
*  Well, I think they're using a number of different techniques and that's the Chinese [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=419.32s)]
*  We again it's still fairly rudimentary and remedial in terms of the the Chinese influence operations once they get a little bit more [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=423.8s)]
*  Sophisticated I think that's where they're they're probably gonna have a greater impact, but it's not just online. It's not just the social media platforms [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=431.76s)]
*  They're actually working at the local levels to support individual candidates and this is some [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=438.8s)]
*  Reporting I think that may come out in the near future, but it's the Chinese have been very very active at a local [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=444.08s)]
*  Corruption level where the Russians are more focused at the top on you know [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=451.08000000000004s)]
*  The more disrupting the election process a good friend in the intelligence community has said, you know [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=456.2s)]
*  Russia is the hurricane China's climate change in the sense of political interference [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=461.72s)]
*  The sort of slow creeping coming up on you I just want to come back you said insider risk to us elections [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=466.28s)]
*  What do you mean by that? Well, it's actually we're seeing [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=473.56s)]
*  actual election workers that have been [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=476.2s)]
*  Swept up in the continued efforts to delegitimize the 2020 election and now they are on the inside [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=479.2s)]
*  They're posing a risk we've seen in Mesa County, Colorado [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=485.4s)]
*  Coffee County, Georgia Antrim County, Michigan where workers have allowed access by [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=488.48s)]
*  Unauthorized people into the system and access to equipment and even just the other day in the primaries [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=494.08s)]
*  We saw that there was a worker that plugged the USB drive into a machine [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=501.08s)]
*  And now those systems are have been rendered or taken out of service [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=506.92s)]
*  So we actually rather than just the foreign [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  Interference threats that I think we really had to think about in 18 and 20 now we have actual insiders [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=514.8s)]
*  We have election workers that are posing a risk to the process itself. Well, that's terrifying [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=526.08s)]
*  So part of the balance for anyone who is in a role like you had how much do you publicize? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=527.44s)]
*  How much do you draw attention? And at what point does that undermine confidence rather than raise confidence in integrity? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=532.0s)]
*  That's the challenge the administration doing enough on what you just laid out [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=538.36s)]
*  Well, I unfortunately I don't think that there are a lot of tools right now available to counter both threats to election workers [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=542.0s)]
*  And we continue to see death threats and under intimidation [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=549.52s)]
*  Means against election workers, but then election workers themselves that have been again swept up into the process [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=553.68s)]
*  So the tools aren't necessarily there. We do need local law enforcement. I think to get more involved in [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=558.88s)]
*  investigating threats protecting [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  Election workers themselves ensuring that they're not being doxxed or their public information or their personal [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=566.4s)]
*  Contact information is being released so they can get so they get more threats [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=571.92s)]
*  So this is an area that I think Congress needs to take a hard look at are the right deterrence measures in place from criminal statutes [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=575.9599999999999s)]
*  And then do we have the investigation techniques? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=583.04s)]
*  It is you know, I personally have received a significant number of death threats and other you know other threats and some of them come in through [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=585.9599999999999s)]

*  Attention on these threats. Otherwise, we're gonna see a shortage of election workers [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=599.0s)]
*  That is quite a warning Chris, thank you for joining us [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=603.8000000000001s)]
*  We're gonna continue to track that story and turn to yet another crisis right now, which is the Trump administration [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=607.44s)]

*  Updating us on what's happening on the ground in Ukraine with the Russian invasion [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=626.12s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to what Defense Secretary Austin called a [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=630.32s)]
*  significant development on the battlefield in the past 48 hours [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=635.6400000000001s)]
*  What do you see happening? And what do you forecast as Vladimir Putin's next move? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=640.48s)]
*  Hey, good morning Margaret, it's great to be with you [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=646.88s)]
*  Well, this is a tremendous victory for for the Ukrainians [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=648.84s)]
*  And it's a victory that I think that they could turn into a cascading series of defeats of Russian forces [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=652.9000000000001s)]
*  This is the the the encirclement of Lyman and and the and the Russian forces pulling back [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=659.36s)]
*  But also in the last two days the Ukraine has also simultaneously [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=664.64s)]
*  Defeated a Russian a Russian counter-attack and also made progress further in the south near the strategically important city of Khursan [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=669.48s)]
*  and I think Margaret what we might be here is really at the precipice of [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=677.36s)]
*  Of really the collapse of the Russian army in Ukraine a moral collapse and and I think [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=681.88s)]
*  They must really be at a breaking point if you look at just the numbers of casualties [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=688.56s)]
*  The vast area that they're trying to defend and now of course Russia is trying to mobilize [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=693.4s)]
*  Conscripts and send them to the front untrained and I think it's very important to to also understand [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=700.48s)]
*  That these forces that are in full retreat now out of Lyman were really the first round of mobilization [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=707.28s)]
*  Remember when who was trying to recruit more and and more people with paying about three times the [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=713.5600000000001s)]
*  The average wages to get so-called volunteers to go forward those forces were hastily trained thrown into that front [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=719.4s)]
*  And these are the forces that are collapsing just right right now [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=725.98s)]
*  Well, and as that happens on the battlefield rhetorically you hear [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=729.96s)]
*  President Putin raise the volume again dangling that nuclear threat on Friday [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=734.8000000000001s)]
*  And there was another Russian leader who talked about using low-yield [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=740.6800000000001s)]
*  Nuclear weapons it's not clear what NATO or the US response would be if Russia used a nuclear [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=744.6800000000001s)]
*  Tactical weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine. What do you think it should be? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=752.2s)]
*  Well, I think the message to him is if you use a nuclear weapon [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  It's a suicide weapon and and the response from NATO and the United States doesn't have to be nuclear [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=760.96s)]
*  First of all, I would say Margaret he's under extreme pressure [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=766.24s)]
*  I mean you you have the failures on the battlefield which we talked about but also the mobilizations failing [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=768.96s)]
*  I mean what he's done is he's mobilized almost three hundred thousand people to leave the country [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=775.04s)]
*  These are these are men who were fleeing to neighboring countries to to escape this this conscription [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=780.1s)]
*  And you have the Russian people now saying okay. I thought this was a special military operation that Putin said [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  They just leave this to me. Don't worry about it now [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=791.34s)]
*  He's going to them to bail him out with this with this mobilization [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=793.66s)]
*  And what you're seeing, you know among the hyper nationalist group of bloggers and and and even on state media is a blaming of the military [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=797.4000000000001s)]
*  What the military is going back to Putin is saying hey, it's not our fault [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=806.2s)]
*  We just need more troops [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=809.1600000000001s)]
*  So it's the cycle that he's responding to with the only quiver he has left which is to to to to threaten [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=810.0s)]
*  The use of a nuclear weapon, but I'll tell you Margaret. I don't think a nuclear weapon is usable there [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=817.96s)]
*  You know, so I think that we ought to take it seriously [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=822.6s)]
*  But we ought to not allow this to cow us in terms of the support for the Ukrainians, right? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=825.6s)]
*  Well, the other weapon he has is energy, of course and [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  tracking this potential [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=835.64s)]
*  Sabotage on the gas pipeline. I want to also ask you about when you were in office back in [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=837.64s)]
*  2017 which is the first time that the US gave [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=843.72s)]
*  offensive weapons to Ukraine [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=847.64s)]
*  I [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  remember when you were put in that position of [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=851.2s)]
*  Having to explain a conversation then President Trump had with Russian officials in the Oval Office where he mentioned [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=854.2399999999999s)]
*  Classified information and you you called it wholly appropriate at the time [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=861.88s)]
*  Given what's going on now this investigation into the classified material at Mar-a-Lago [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=867.0799999999999s)]
*  Were you ever uncomfortable with the former president's handling of classified information? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=872.0s)]
*  Well more remember I left in February March of [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=876.44s)]
*  2018 but while I was there I did not see any problems in handling of [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=879.1600000000001s)]
*  Classified information and and what you're talking about really is a session of which the president did not disclose [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=883.5600000000001s)]
*  Classified information, but somebody leaked it and then it was published in a newspaper. So [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=889.6400000000001s)]
*  The classified information I think what is important is to go back to that period and that provision of [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=894.6400000000001s)]
*  The defensive capabilities to the Ukrainians was really important and and the argument I made to President Trump at the time [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=901.76s)]
*  Was hey these people who tell you that it's provocative to provide Ukraine with defensive capabilities [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=906.0400000000001s)]
*  Actually what provokes Putin is weakness and he was persuaded by that argument and I think that [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=911.36s)]
*  Argument is still relevant today. I mean as as Putin is encountering these difficulties [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=917.44s)]
*  I think it's now time to remove some of the restrictions that we've put on ourselves [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=921.8000000000001s)]
*  I think it's now time to remove some of the restrictions that we've put on ourselves in terms of the support to give the Ukrainians [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=926.5200000000001s)]
*  And I'm talking about really long-range surveillance capabilities tied to long-range precision strike [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=933.32s)]
*  And yeah, that's really what they need. I think to to maintain the momentum militarily at this stage [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=938.48s)]
*  I have a follow-up question on that but just to button up the question [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=943.2s)]
*  I asked you that was a no you were never uncomfortable with the hand handling classified information [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=945.96s)]
*  Okay, no, you know Margaret there were systems in place [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=951.96s)]
*  I don't know what happened to those systems, you know, but but I but I was never uncomfortable with it while I was there [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=954.52s)]
*  But you know that was a long time ago now, okay [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=959.64s)]
*  I know when you're in office, you never like answering counterfactuals, but you're not an office. So [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=962.18s)]
*  Was Vladimir Putin so committed to this invasion that he would have gone through with it no matter what I [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=969.68s)]
*  Don't think so think about all this support that we've given now to the Ukrainians [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=978.72s)]
*  What if we had done that a few years ago? I think Putin may have come to the conclusion [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=982.78s)]
*  Well, Ukraine cannot be can cannot be subsumed at an acceptable cost [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=987.3s)]
*  And of course he was wrong and all the assumptions that led to the invasion and he's been proven wrong by courageous Ukrainians [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=991.74s)]
*  Who are defending their sovereignty, but I think deterrence by denial for us was a failure [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=998.1s)]
*  I mean in many of the actions that we took in in the months before [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1003.42s)]
*  Before the invasion almost I think inadvertently greenlighted it, you know [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1007.4s)]
*  Pulling our forces out of the Black Sea [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1010.62s)]
*  Listing all the things we weren't going to do and I think the Biden administration has recovered from that very well [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1012.7s)]
*  But but I think now is the time Margaret to lift restrictions on the support that we're giving Ukrainians [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1018.14s)]
*  So they can finish this fight on their terms. All right HR McMaster. Thank you very much for your insight today [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1023.5400000000001s)]
*  We'll be back in a moment [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1030.5s)]
*  You [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1032.78s)]
*  Tomorrow's the first Monday in October which means a new Supreme Court term and new Supreme Court Justice Katanji Brown Jackson is now on the job [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1035.66s)]
*  Chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford is here with us [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1044.02s)]
*  Jan this is a change [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1047.66s)]
*  How much of a development is it to have a new justice on this court? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1051.38s)]
*  Well, I mean obviously we have an historic new justice the first black female justice on the Supreme Court [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1055.34s)]
*  She'll take her seat on that bench tomorrow for arguments for the first time we have four women on the court now [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1059.86s)]
*  That's never happened before either [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1065.3799999999999s)]
*  But what hasn't changed is this is a court that's firmly turned to the right. You've got six conservative justices three liberals [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1067.4199999999998s)]
*  It's a court that's willing to rethink decades of progressive ruling. So despite all the historic nature [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1074.46s)]
*  Justice Jackson really won't change the balance of the Supreme Court at all [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1081.1s)]
*  You were here in June and you left with kind of an ominous [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1085.1s)]
*  Statement in talking about [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1089.54s)]
*  potential political earthquakes coming out of Supreme Court decisions like what we saw out of the overturning of Roe v [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1091.86s)]
*  Wade the first key court case is Tuesday. What should we be expecting? Well, I mean, let me just say we're off the top though [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1099.86s)]
*  I mean buckle your seat belts because this contentious this last term was I think this term has the potential to be equally divisive [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1106.74s)]
*  You're going to have issues on affirmative action voting rights [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1114.1399999999999s)]
*  LGBTQ [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1117.78s)]
*  Discrimination environmental cases all of these cases and they're starting right away on Tuesday with a major voting rights case from Alabama [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1120.06s)]
*  challengers are saying that Alabama is diluting the power of black voters because they're packing most of the states black voters into one [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1127.78s)]
*  Legislative district they say there should be two [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1135.46s)]
*  Alabama is saying well, we shouldn't even be considering race in drawing these legislative [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1138.06s)]
*  Districts that would violate the Constitution if the court agrees with that that would be a major rethinking of the Voting Rights Act [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1142.74s)]
*  So this is a big case with significant implications well beyond the state of Alabama [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1149.58s)]
*  And you but but that's not the only issue this month on race at the end of the month [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1154.74s)]
*  We've got that affirmative action case coming out of Harvard and the University of North Carolina [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1159.44s)]
*  That is asking the Supreme Court a group of white and Asian American students to say that any consideration of race and emissions [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1163.58s)]
*  Affirmative action in college emissions violates the Constitution [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1171.14s)]
*  I expect the court to agree with that decision and the use of affirmative action obviously quite a controversial decision [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1174.6200000000001s)]
*  Then they have the the case involving a Colorado website designer and whether or not she can be forced to design a website for same-sex [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGo4DpD6Tk&t=1181.38s)]
