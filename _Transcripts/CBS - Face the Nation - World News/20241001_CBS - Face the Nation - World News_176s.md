# Netanyahu vows retaliation after Iran's missile attack against Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc)
*  Breaking news in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran has launched a missile attack against Israel. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=1.96s)]
*  Israeli military says there will be consequences for these strikes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=5.12s)]
*  The U.S. helped intercept some of the incoming missiles as it worked to defend its ally. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  The White House says the attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=14.8s)]
*  Vice President Harris addressed this situation earlier. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=19.2s)]
*  I condemn this attack unequivocally. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=22.8s)]
*  I'm clear-eyed. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=26.16s)]
*  Iran is a destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East, and today's attack on Israel [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=27.84s)]
*  only further demonstrates that fact. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=34.44s)]
*  CBS News' senior foreign correspondent, Elizabeth Palmer, joins us now from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  Elizabeth, what's the latest on the ground in Israel? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=42.08s)]
*  Well, we've just heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time since [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=47.32s)]
*  those missiles came in. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=52.56s)]
*  And he says that ifâ€”he said basically Iran has made a big mistake tonight and if it's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=55.2s)]
*  going to pay. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  We heard earlier from Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, that there would be grave [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=64.16s)]
*  consequences and the U.S. would work with Israel to make sure that they happen. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=68.08s)]
*  So the rhetoric here is aggressive and it is also in Iran, where the Revolutionary [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=73.44s)]
*  Guards have made it clear that if Israel does retaliate, there will be serious escalation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=80.08s)]
*  So it's pretty tense. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=86.0s)]
*  What do we know about what got us here? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=90.24s)]
*  Why did Iran carry out this strike? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=91.6s)]
*  Well, today Israel did limited ground incursions into Lebanon. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=96.56s)]
*  That might have been a catalyst. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=103.12s)]
*  But the Revolutionary Guard made it clear that this is a retaliation that's been coming [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=105.6s)]
*  for some time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=112.8s)]
*  You may recall that back in July, the head of Hamas was killed while he was visiting [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  Iran by a rocket that went into his room inside a Revolutionary Guard compound. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=120.0s)]
*  So deadly, it killed the head of Hamas, but also very embarrassing for Iran's Revolutionary [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=126.96s)]
*  Guard. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=132.48s)]
*  They had threatened to retaliate for that and we've been waiting to see what that retaliation [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=133.44s)]
*  would be. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=139.2s)]
*  Add to that the death of the head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, last week in Beirut. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=140.56s)]
*  The Revolutionary Guard have said this is a double retaliation for those two murders of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=147.76s)]
*  allies who were very important to us. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=154.32s)]
*  So they've tied it to, in a sort of tit for tat, to those two incidents. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=157.36s)]
*  And now Israel is going to have to decide how or if it wants to carry this on and escalate. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=163.68s)]
*  Elizabeth Palmer, thank you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0eMOAEAzzc&t=173.6s)]
