# U.S. and Panama sign agreement to curb Darién Gap crossings
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls)
*  The United States and Panama signed an agreement Monday to block migrants who used the treacherous [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=0.0s)]
*  Darien Gap jungle to reach the American southern border. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=4.98s)]
*  Under the joint initiative, American officials will help the Panamanian government deport [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=9.72s)]
*  migrants who entered Panama illegally from Colombia using the largely lawless corridor. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=13.34s)]
*  In recent years, Panama has reported record numbers of crossings along the road in the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=19.28s)]
*  Darien jungle, including over half a million in 2023 alone. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=26.72s)]
*  CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya Galvez joins us from Douglas, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=31.0s)]
*  Arizona. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=35.66s)]
*  Camilo, how significant is this agreement? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=36.66s)]
*  Well, we'll start there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=39.6s)]
*  Hi, John. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=42.72s)]
*  This agreement with Panama is the latest step taken by the Biden administration to try to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=45.08s)]
*  reduce illegal crossings here along the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=49.36s)]
*  It is also the latest measure that the administration has taken to take a more regional approach [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=53.96s)]
*  to this incredibly vexing and complex issue of migration across the Western Hemisphere. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=59.32000000000001s)]
*  As you mentioned, the Department of Homeland Security is now preparing to send a team of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=66.08s)]
*  U.S. immigration officials and asylum officers to Panama to help their counterparts there [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=70.36s)]
*  screen migrants who make asylum claims, but also to deport and repatriate migrants who [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  are not able to meet the eligibility requirements for legal protection in Panama. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=82.86s)]
*  And most of these migrants, as Hugh Well underscored, are crossing the notorious Darien jungle that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=89.3s)]
*  divides Panama and South America. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=95.22s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of migrants, John, have been crossing this roadless jungle that divides [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=97.9s)]
*  Panama and Colombia to try to reach the U.S. in recent years, including half a million [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=103.06s)]
*  just last year. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=107.72s)]
*  And how's the cost? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=109.52s)]
*  Who's going to cover the cost of doing these deportations? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=110.52s)]
*  This will all be subsidized, John, via State Department funds. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=117.24s)]
*  Congress was already notified that the State Department will be sending money and allocating [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  funds towards this effort. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=126.8s)]
*  And again, it is an American-driven and subsidized program, but it is important to underscore, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  John, that Panamanian authorities will be the ones screening migrants and deporting [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=134.52s)]
*  them to countries like Venezuela or other nations across Latin America that are seeing [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=139.36s)]
*  some of their citizens cross the Darien jungle. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=144.66000000000003s)]
*  The U.S. will not directly be involved in deporting people. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=146.78s)]
*  The extent of the help that the U.S. will provide will be limited to training and financial [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=151.12s)]
*  assistance. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=155.8s)]
*  Panama's new president, who took office on Monday, has faced pressure to curb the illegal [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=156.8s)]
*  immigration. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=162.66000000000003s)]
*  How's he responding to this, or what's he saying about this? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=164.22s)]
*  Yeah, Panama's new president has taken a very tough stance against migrant arrivals across [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=167.22s)]
*  the Darien Gap, vowing to close the jungle to migrants and also accusing international [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  aid workers who work in this region of facilitating illegal immigration. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=180.38s)]
*  It is still very unclear how the new president would be able to accomplish a goal of closing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  the border. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=191.6s)]
*  That rhetoric here in the U.S., John, and as you know, closing a border is not an easy [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=192.64s)]
*  task for sure, and some say it is actually impossible because of operational, logistical, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=198.2s)]
*  and legal reasons, but that is what the president in Panama has vowed to do, to close the border [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  to recent arrivals. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=208.56s)]
*  And this agreement with the U.S. certainly indicates that this new administration in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=210.24s)]
*  Panama wants to deport more people from the Darien Gap and reduce the number of people [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=214.56s)]
*  who are crossing that jungle. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=219.28s)]
*  Camilo, the agreement, this agreement has apparently been in the works for months. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=221.32s)]
*  What do you make of the timing of this announcement? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=227.72s)]
*  Well, as you know, the Biden administration has been taking several actions to try to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=231.0s)]
*  curb illegal immigration here at the border. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  More recently, the administration issued that sweeping executive action by President Biden [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=237.56s)]
*  that is disqualifying most migrants from being able to request and win asylum here at the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=242.68s)]
*  border. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=248.16s)]
*  That has allowed U.S. border officials, John, as we have discussed, to more quickly deport [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=249.16s)]
*  thousands of migrants on a weekly basis to Mexico across this wall or to their home countries [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  without allowing them to request asylum in the first place. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=259.0s)]
*  The administration also announced today, John, that it conducted the first repatriation flight [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=262.76s)]
*  to China since 2018. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=268.04s)]
*  We have seen record numbers of Chinese migrants come to the border in recent years, and so [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=270.56s)]
*  this agreement with Panama, rather, is the latest effort in this broader campaign by [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=274.76000000000005s)]
*  the Biden administration to try to reduce the number of people crossing the border before [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  the election. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  And so far, U.S. officials would say that these policies are working. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=285.48s)]
*  We have seen a dramatic drop in illegal crossings. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  In June, Border Patrol recorded the lowest level in illegal crossings along the border [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  since President Biden took office. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=298.76000000000005s)]
*  Camilo Montoya-Galvez in Douglas, Arizona. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=300.44000000000005s)]
*  Thank you, Camilo. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZefzRPwls&t=303.40000000000003s)]
