# Breaking down U.S.-Iran relations as Trump restores "maximum pressure" on Tehran
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8)
*  This morning Iran's president claimed that President Trump is aiming to bring Iran to its knees the remarks were made during Iran's celebration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=0.0s)]
*  marking the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution the country's president also claimed that the United States is not sincere in seeking [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=6.36s)]
*  Negotiations with Tehran. I want to bring in CBS News national security contributor Samantha Vinograd who is in Washington [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=14.4s)]
*  And joins me now to talk about all this so Sam [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  How would you classify the relationship between the United States and Tehran right now? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=24.38s)]
*  The relationship between the United States and Iran at this moment is frosty at best [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=29.86s)]
*  46 years since the Iranian Revolution the Iranian economy is under intensive pressure because of us and other [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=35.5s)]
*  international sanctions [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=43.6s)]
*  military pressure from Israel [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=45.34s)]
*  United States against its proxies throughout the region and of course Israel's direct attack within Iran itself [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=47.78s)]
*  energy shortages are racking the country and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=54.46s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=58.14s)]
*  continuing a pace despite [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  President Trump's announcement of restoring maximum pressure against Iran just last week Vlad [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=63.82000000000001s)]
*  What is the future for Iran look like during the Trump administration [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=71.62s)]
*  You know one of the things I have noted Sam is while the president continues to talk tough on Iran [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=76.42s)]
*  He's also used language about quote-unquote making a deal with Iran and not sure exactly over what but it does sound like he's open [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=82.1s)]
*  to some type of diplomacy [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  Well when we look at Iran's nuclear program Vlad Iran today is closer to a nuclear weapon than they've ever been in their history [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=92.82s)]
*  They're really at a nuclear threshold [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=100.22s)]
*  they have more higher grade and rich uranium than ever before and their quote-unquote breakout time to actually [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=102.38s)]
*  translate that into a weapon is [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=109.5s)]
*  Shortened now the intelligence community has assessed that the regime has not decided to actually build a weapon [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=112.02s)]
*  But they're closer than they've ever been before [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=117.66s)]
*  President Trump withdrew the United States from the nuclear agreement with Iran back in 2018 and since [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=120.38s)]
*  Coming back into office president Trump has voiced a willingness to engage with Iran on how to curtail its nuclear program [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=128.02s)]
*  on the Iranian side we've heard mixed messages the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=135.82s)]
*  President of Iran expressed a willingness to potentially engage in negotiations [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=140.02s)]
*  But then the supreme leader who is ultimately going to be in charge of deciding whether to engage in negotiations [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=144.54s)]
*  Chuck those off the table [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=150.86s)]
*  I will add one caveat Vlad having worked on the early days of the Iran nuclear deal under President Obama [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=152.22s)]
*  whatever we are hearing publicly is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=158.74s)]
*  definitively not indicative of private messages that may be [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=161.66s)]
*  Passed behind the scenes between the United States and Iran either directly or via intermediary [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=165.62s)]
*  So I would say we are seeing signals that there's an openness on both sides to at least broach the topic of nuclear [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  Negotiations and yet Sam the president has revoked the security [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=179.34s)]
*  Details of several former administration members including the CIA director Mike Pompeo [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=183.86s)]
*  National Security Adviser John Bolton [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=189.46s)]
*  We know that the United States under President Trump and President Biden carried out very successful [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=192.02s)]
*  Operations against some key Iranian targets including military leaders there [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=198.10000000000002s)]
*  How dangerous is it for the president to have done something like that? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=202.66s)]
*  How dangerous is it for folks like Pompeo and Bolton and others to be out there without any protection from? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=206.3s)]
*  nefarious Iranian agents [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=213.74s)]
*  Well having seen the threat assessments [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=216.38s)]
*  But without going into classified information there remains an ongoing threat to former National Security [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  Adviser John Bolton to President Trump himself and to a few others [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=224.86s)]
*  We know that Iran remains intent on seeking retribution for the US military strike that killed Qasem Soleimani [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=229.02s)]
*  We also know that there have been court cases against individuals [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=235.62s)]
*  Directed by the regime in Iran to carry out assassinations on US soil [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=239.5s)]
*  So it is certainly a dangerous move to remove John Bolton's security detail [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=243.98s)]
*  Among others these assassination plots as well as Iran's nuclear program is a regime's trump card [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  Under enormous pressure from the United States Israel and international sanctions [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=256.7s)]
*  These are their trump cards in terms of trying to dissuade the United States dissuade Israel from taking more advanced action [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=261.02s)]
*  And so they will likely hold on to their ability to conduct these plots as well as their nuclear program [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=268.6s)]
*  long enough to test US credibility [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=275.56s)]
*  When it comes to actually engaging in meaningful negotiations [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=279.16s)]
*  All right, Sam Vinograd for us always great to have you my friend. Thank you. Thanks, Glenn [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMcDU5dQ9r8&t=283.44s)]
