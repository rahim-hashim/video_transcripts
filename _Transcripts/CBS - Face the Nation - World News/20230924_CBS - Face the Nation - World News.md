# Robert O'Brien, U.S. hostage envoy under Trump, "very concerned" about fallout from deal with Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [September 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8)
*  And we turn now to Robert O'Brien. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=0.0s)]
*  He served as national security advisor [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=2.5s)]
*  under former President Trump, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=4.42s)]
*  and he joins us this morning from Park City, Utah. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=5.88s)]
*  Ambassador, it's good to have you here with us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=9.58s)]
*  Nice to be with you, Margaret, thank you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=12.48s)]
*  I wanna ask you about a number of national security matters, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=14.66s)]
*  but I wanna start on this idea [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  of a potential government shutdown. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=19.76s)]
*  National security-wise, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=22.82s)]
*  what do you think the message is to the world [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=24.16s)]
*  when basic matters of governance [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  seem politically insurmountable [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=28.98s)]
*  and the government shuts down? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=31.46s)]
*  Well, what we used to say in the NSC [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=34.42s)]
*  and President Trump's administration [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=36.38s)]
*  was economic security is national security. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=37.66s)]
*  And we've got too big of a debt, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=40.46s)]
*  and we've gotta get the debt under control. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=41.94s)]
*  I think Speaker McCarthy's done a great job [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=43.86s)]
*  and negotiated a good deal, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  and I think it'd be great [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=47.78s)]
*  if the Republicans got behind Speaker McCarthy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  But I understand why there's concern [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=51.42s)]
*  over the size of the debt, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=52.82s)]
*  and I understand the frustration [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  of some of the GOP members. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=56.58s)]
*  I mean, it's understandable. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=58.019999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, Republicans have objected [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=59.339999999999996s)]
*  to even passing defense spending at this point. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=61.48s)]
*  Aren't we in a sort of dangerous moment? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=66.17999999999999s)]
*  Well, I came out in favor of passing the NDA, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=70.42s)]
*  and I think a lot of our other conservatives [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=72.46s)]
*  like Mike Gallagher and Mike Walz and others did. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=74.06s)]
*  So I think we need to get [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=76.18s)]
*  that defense bill passed immediately. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=80.46s)]
*  You were the hostage envoy under President Trump [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=81.74s)]
*  before you became his national security advisor, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=84.94s)]
*  and you did help bring three citizens home from Iran. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=88.14s)]
*  This week, we saw a number of Americans return [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  in a very happy reunion. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=95.7s)]
*  Siamak Namazi, Ahmed Shargi, Maraad Tabaz. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=97.46s)]
*  Why wasn't the last administration able to get them out? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=101.58s)]
*  Why is it so hard to bring home Americans from Iran? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=105.18s)]
*  Well, we had unprecedented success [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=110.18s)]
*  in the Trump administration. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=111.97999999999999s)]
*  As you know, Margaret, we brought home [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=112.86s)]
*  over 58 hostages from countries all over the world, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=114.02000000000001s)]
*  North Korea, Iran, Russia. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=117.30000000000001s)]
*  But we had a ground rule, we wouldn't pay ransom. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=120.86s)]
*  And I was so pleased to see Siamak and Maraad [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=123.42s)]
*  and the others come home. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  I felt like I failed them by not getting them home. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=128.38s)]
*  But we weren't gonna pay $6 billion. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=130.82s)]
*  We weren't gonna pay a billion plus per hostage [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=132.34s)]
*  because that creates a market for hostages. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=134.86s)]
*  It makes your blue passport worth a billion dollars. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=138.06s)]
*  And so I'm concerned that Americans traveling abroad [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=140.26s)]
*  are gonna be targeted by countries like Russia [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=143.5s)]
*  and China and Iran, but also terrorist organizations [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=145.78s)]
*  who know that they can get a big ransom [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=148.58s)]
*  if we pay these sorts of fees. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=150.74s)]
*  And we just weren't prepared to do it, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=153.74s)]
*  but we had unprecedented success bringing Americans home [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=155.14s)]
*  from all over the world. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=157.34s)]
*  The other issue, Margaret, is what is Iran gonna do [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=158.62s)]
*  with that money? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=161.7s)]
*  We saw this with the JCPOA. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=162.54s)]
*  They took that money and they spent it on terrorism [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=164.58s)]
*  and on ballistic missiles and on nuclear programs. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=166.62s)]
*  I'm afraid they're gonna build more drones [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=168.98s)]
*  that kill Ukrainians with the money we just gave them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  So I'm thrilled to see Siomak and Murad [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=172.38s)]
*  in the other's home, but I'm very concerned [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=175.54s)]
*  about the look of the deal internationally. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=177.74s)]
*  Well, as you know, the current administration would argue [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=180.18s)]
*  that those funds are being held in a restricted account [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=183.06s)]
*  in Qatar, just like they were held in a restricted account [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=185.46s)]
*  in South Korea under the Trump administration, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=187.9s)]
*  where Iran did have access, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=190.3s)]
*  though they had difficulty getting to that money. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=191.62s)]
*  Why is that not a sufficient level of protection? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=194.14s)]
*  Well, the president of Iran came to the UNGA last week [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  and said he'll use the money any way he pleases it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  It's the money of the people of Iran [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=203.57999999999998s)]
*  and he'll use it however he wants. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=206.1s)]
*  And we have to understand, Margaret, money is fungible. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=208.14s)]
*  So the money that they're spending now [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=210.89999999999998s)]
*  on children's hospitals and on food, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=213.26s)]
*  they'll use that for the military and for terrorism [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=215.26s)]
*  and take this money and replace it with the other programs. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=217.89999999999998s)]
*  So money's fungible. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=220.89999999999998s)]
*  This money is going to the Iran regime. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=222.33999999999997s)]
*  It's a terrorist regime. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=224.14s)]
*  It's the largest state sponsor of terrorism [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=225.26s)]
*  and it's gonna kill a lot of people, unfortunately. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=227.38s)]
*  Should travel be banned to Iran? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=229.54s)]
*  I believe so, absolutely. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=232.7s)]
*  The problem is, is this happened after the JCPOA [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=234.78s)]
*  when we paid hundreds of millions per hostage. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=237.01999999999998s)]
*  The price went up from Obama to Biden, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  but as soon as they let a couple of hostages go, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  Jason Rezarin and others, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=245.89999999999998s)]
*  they just restocked the pool of hostages. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=247.45999999999998s)]
*  They went and took a few more dual citizens [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=249.14s)]
*  who were visiting family in Iran and took them hostage. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=250.7s)]
*  So we've got to stop Americans going to Iran, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=254.06s)]
*  but we've got to start thinking about [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=256.34s)]
*  Americans going to China and Russia as well, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=257.74s)]
*  where they're taking hostages and using this against us. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=259.62s)]
*  I wanna ask you about national security [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=263.86s)]
*  as it relates to the upcoming US election as well. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=266.38s)]
*  You have been very clear that Joe Biden won [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  the 2020 election. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=272.06s)]
*  You helped with the transition of power [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=273.42s)]
*  between administrations. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=275.54s)]
*  CNN reported you considered resigning after January the 6th. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=277.46000000000004s)]
*  Is that report true? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=281.94s)]
*  That's an inaccurate report. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=284.38s)]
*  I had never considered resigning. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  My feeling as national security advisor is that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=287.86s)]
*  you took the job for the good days and the bad days. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=290.06s)]
*  And the Abraham Accords. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=292.14s)]
*  That was a pretty bad day. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=293.98s)]
*  That was a bad day, but we had the Abraham Accords. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  We had Serbia Kosovo. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=297.38s)]
*  We got NATO to spend money defending themselves, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=298.54s)]
*  which is now helping Ukraine. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=301.26s)]
*  So President Trump had a really successful [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=302.90000000000003s)]
*  foreign policy run, but there are bad days too. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=305.14s)]
*  And that was a bad day, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=308.62s)]
*  but I was gonna stick around for the president [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  and for the American people. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=311.18s)]
*  And fortunately I had a lot of senators and congressmen [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  who reached out and said, please stay. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  We've got foreign adversaries, China and Russia. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=316.62s)]
*  We wanna take advantage of the chaos. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=319.26s)]
*  And so Mike Pompeo and John Radcliffe and myself, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=321.62s)]
*  the national security team, Chris Miller over at defense, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=324.46s)]
*  we stuck around and we send a strong message to the Chinese. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=327.66s)]
*  We send a strong message to the Russians [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=330.18s)]
*  that the American people are united, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=332.5s)]
*  that we remain fundamentally strong [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=333.86s)]
*  and we're not gonna let them take advantage [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=335.86s)]
*  of any domestic political discord in the United States. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=337.9s)]
*  And I think that served the president well, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=341.74s)]
*  and I think it served the American people well. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=343.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, given Donald Trump's role in the events [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=345.1s)]
*  leading to that day, I wonder if you would serve [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=349.62s)]
*  in a second Trump administration. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=353.1s)]
*  Look, I had a great run as national security advisor [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=356.66s)]
*  and as the hostage envoy and I served the country well, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  I think, but you always have to wait and see [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=362.82000000000005s)]
*  what the president of the United States asks you to do [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=365.98s)]
*  and what your family wants to do. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=367.66s)]
*  But I grew up in a household with a dad who was a Marine [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=368.90000000000003s)]
*  and a mom who was a big patriot. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=371.86s)]
*  By the way, it's our 80th birthday today, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=373.98s)]
*  so happy birthday, mom. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=375.21999999999997s)]
*  And my feeling is if the president asks you to serve, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=376.78s)]
*  and I've got kids who are serving in the military, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=379.74s)]
*  you salute and say yes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=382.18s)]
*  But that's really up to President Trump if he wins, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=383.26s)]
*  which right now, according to the Washington Post, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=385.1s)]
*  he's up by 10 points. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=387.26s)]
*  So it looks good for him, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=388.82s)]
*  but that's up to him and my family. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=389.86s)]
*  You don't have any doubts? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=392.9s)]
*  Well, I think there's gonna be a great team [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=395.86s)]
*  and I think we need to return. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=397.14s)]
*  America looks weak now, we're not weak, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=398.62s)]
*  we're fundamentally strong, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=400.38s)]
*  but America looks very weak right now [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=401.38s)]
*  and we have to return to a posture of peace or strength [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=403.3s)]
*  or we're gonna have real problems with China, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=405.14s)]
*  with Russia, with Iran in the future. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=408.1s)]
*  And so I think anyone who believes in peace or strength [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=409.5s)]
*  and is asked to serve and has experience to do so [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=412.82s)]
*  should do so and defend America, absolutely. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=415.74s)]
*  And I know you cannot talk about the details [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=419.78000000000003s)]
*  of the two investigations brought by the special counsel, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=421.94s)]
*  Jack Smith, because you were subpoenaed. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=425.38s)]
*  So we have to leave that part of the conversation there. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=428.3s)]
*  Robert O'Brien, thank you very much [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=431.98s)]
*  for joining us on Face the Nation. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPQlxDi4S8&t=433.70000000000005s)]
