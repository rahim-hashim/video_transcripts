# Biden says NATO "more powerful than ever" in speech marking 75 years of alliance
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [July 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o)
*  I would appreciate it. President Biden is speaking at NATO's 75th Anniversary Summit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden, including President Truman, came together in this very room. Came together [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=4.4s)]
*  in this very room. History was watching. It had been four years since the surrender of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=8.88s)]
*  the Axis powers, and the end of the most devastating war that the world had ever, ever known. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=16.0s)]
*  Here, these 12 leaders gathered to make a sacred pledge to defend each other against aggression, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=23.6s)]
*  provide their collective security, and to answer threats as one. Because they knew, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  to prevent future wars, to protect democracies, to lay the groundwork for lasting peace and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=38.88s)]
*  prosperity, they needed a new approach. They needed to combine their strengths. They needed [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=44.8s)]
*  an alliance. And here they signed the Washington Treaty and created the North Atlantic Treaty [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=51.84s)]
*  Organization, the single greatest, most effective defense alliance in the history of the world. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=58.88s)]
*  Mr. Secretary General, leaders of NATO countries, foreign and defense ministers, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  representatives from partner nations, and the European Union, and members of Congress, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=73.12s)]
*  distinguished guests, welcome, welcome to the 2024 NATO Summit. It's a pleasure. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=78.32s)]
*  It's a pleasure to host you in this milestone year, to look back with pride at all we've achieved, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=90.96s)]
*  and look ahead to our shared future with strength and with resolve. Together, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=97.28s)]
*  we rebuilt Europe from the ruins of war, held high the torch of liberty during long decades [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=104.56s)]
*  of the Cold War. When former adversaries became fellow democracies, we welcomed them into the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=111.36s)]
*  alliance. When war broke out in the Balkans, we intervened to restore peace and stop ethnic cleansing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  And when the United States was attacked on September 11th, our NATO allies, all of you, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  stood with us, invoking Article 5 for the first time in NATO history, treating an attack on us [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=129.52s)]
*  as an attack on all of us, a breathtaking display of friendship that the American people will never, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=136.8s)]
*  ever, ever forget. Through all this history, when great changes occurred, people would ask, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=142.96s)]
*  can NATO adapt? And every time we proved we could adapt, and we did, evolving our strategies to stay [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=150.24s)]
*  ahead of threats, reaching out to new partners to increase our effectiveness. And here with us today [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=159.04s)]
*  are countries from the Indo-Pacific region. They're here because they have a stake in our success, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  and we have a stake in theirs. Today, NATO is more powerful than ever. 32 nations strong. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=173.04s)]
*  For years, Finland and Sweden were among our closest partners. Now they have chosen to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=182.64s)]
*  officially join NATO, and because of the power and meaning of Article 5 guarantee, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=188.8s)]
*  that's the reason. It was the most important aspect of the alliance in 1949, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  and it is still the most important aspect. I'd also note Finland and Sweden joined the alliance [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  not just because their leaders sought it, because their citizens called for it in overwhelming [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=207.28s)]
*  numbers. Remember, NATO's character is fundamentally democratic, always has been and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=212.56s)]
*  always must continue to be. And today, NATO is better resourced than it ever has been. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  I want to pause on this because it's significant. In the year 2020, the year I was elected president, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  only nine NATO allies are spending 2 percent of their defense and GDP on defense. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  This year, 23 will spend at least 2 percent. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  And some will spend more than that, and the remaining countries that have not yet reached [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=250.08s)]
*  that milestone will get there soon. This remarkable progress [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=255.68s)]
*  proves that our commitment is broad and deep, that we're ready, that we're willing, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=260.79999999999995s)]
*  we're able to deter aggression and defend every inch of NATO territory across every domain—land, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  air, sea, cyber, and space. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  My friends, it's good that we're stronger than ever, because this moment in history [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=280.4s)]
*  calls for our collective strength. Autocrats want overturned global order, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=286.64s)]
*  which is by and large kept for nearly 80 years and counting. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=293.68s)]
*  Terrorist groups continue to plot evil schemes to cause mayhem and chaos and suffering. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=297.76s)]
*  In Europe, Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine continues, and Putin wants nothing less [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=303.92s)]
*  than Ukraine's total subjugation to end Ukraine's democracy, to destroy Ukraine's culture, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=311.28s)]
*  and to wipe Ukraine off the map. And we know Putin won't stop at Ukraine, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=321.12s)]
*  but make no mistake, Ukraine can and will stop Putin. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=327.2s)]
*  And they have our full support. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=332.88s)]
*  Even before Russian bombs were falling in Ukraine, the alliance acted. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=345.68s)]
*  I ordered the U.S. reinforcements at NATO's Eastern flank. More troops, more aircraft, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=351.2s)]
*  more capabilities. And now the United States has more than 100,000 troops on the continent of [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=358.08s)]
*  Europe. NATO moves swiftly as well, not only reinforcing the four existing battlegroups in [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=364.08s)]
*  the east, but also adding four more in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, essentially [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  doubling NATO's strength on the Eastern flank. Together, we've built a global coalition to stand [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  with Ukraine. Together, we've provided significant economic and humanitarian assistance. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=386.24s)]
*  And together, we've supplied Ukraine with weapons it needs to defend itself — tanks, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=392.48s)]
*  armored fighting vehicles, air defense systems, long-range missiles, and millions of munitions. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=398.08s)]
*  The United States and nearly two dozen allied partners have signed a bilateral security [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=405.36s)]
*  agreement with Ukraine. And more countries will follow. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=411.28s)]
*  Today, I'm announcing the historic donation of air defense equipment for Ukraine. The United States, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=415.12s)]
*  Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, and Italy will provide Ukraine with the equipment [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  for five additional strategic air defense systems. And in the coming months, the United States and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=429.28s)]
*  our partners intend to provide Ukraine with dozens of additional tactical air defense systems. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=434.88s)]
*  The United States will make sure that when we export critical air defense interceptors, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  Ukraine goes to the front of the line. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=445.67999999999995s)]
*  But we'll get this assistance before anyone else gets it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=454.4s)]
*  All told, Ukraine will receive hundreds of additional interceptors over the next year, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  helping protect Ukrainian cities against Russian missiles and Ukrainian troops [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=463.67999999999995s)]
*  facing air attacks on their front lines. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=468.64s)]
*  Make no mistake, Russia is failing in this war. More than two years into Putin's war of choice, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  his losses are staggering. More than 350,000 Russian troops dead or wounded. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=479.68s)]
*  Nearly one million Russians — many of them young people — have left Russia [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=485.91999999999996s)]
*  because they no longer see a future in Russia. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=489.36s)]
*  And Kiev — remember, fellas and ladies? It was supposed to fall in five days. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=493.2s)]
*  Remember? It was still standing two and a half years later, and it will continue to stand. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=498.24s)]
*  All of our allies knew that before this war, Putin thought NATO would break. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=510.64000000000004s)]
*  Today, NATO is stronger than it's ever been in its history. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=517.2s)]
*  When this census war began, Ukraine was a free country. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=521.52s)]
*  Today, it is still a free country. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=525.92s)]
*  And the war will end with Ukraine remaining a free and independent country. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=529.44s)]
*  Russia will not prevail. Ukraine will prevail. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=535.44s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a pivotal moment for Europe, for the Transatlantic Community, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=543.92s)]
*  and I might add for the world. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=550.48s)]
*  Let's remember the fact that NATO remains the bulwark of global security did not happen by [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=552.48s)]
*  accident. It wasn't inevitable. Again and again, at critical moments, we chose unity over disunion, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=557.2s)]
*  progress over retreat, freedom over tyranny, hope over fear. Again and again, we stood [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=565.4399999999999s)]
*  behind our shared vision of a peaceful and prosperous Transatlantic Community. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=572.08s)]
*  Here at this summit, we gather to proclaim NATO is ready [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=576.72s)]
*  and able to secure that vision today and well into the future. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=580.64s)]
*  Let me say this. An overwhelming bipartisan majority of Americans understand that NATO makes [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=591.12s)]
*  us all safer. The fact that both Democratic and Republican parties are represented here today is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=598.1600000000001s)]
*  a testament to that fact. The American people know that all the progress we've made in the past 75 [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=604.96s)]
*  years has happened behind the shield of NATO. And the American people understand what would happen [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=612.32s)]
*  if there was no NATO. Another war in Europe. American troops fighting and dying. Dictators [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  spreading chaos. Economic collapse. Catastrophes. Americans, they know we're stronger with our [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=627.52s)]
*  friends. And we understand this is a sacred obligation. As President Reagan put it, and I [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=635.68s)]
*  quote, for our fellow democracies are not secure, we cannot be secure. If you are threatened, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=642.72s)]
*  we are threatened. If you're not at peace, we cannot be at peace. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=649.68s)]
*  Reagan knew it then, and we know it now. Our nations will continue to keep faith with what we pledged in years to come. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=655.04s)]
*  Now, if you'll indulge me, I'd like to end my remarks a slightly unusual way. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=665.92s)]
*  NATO is an alliance of nations, but also made up of leaders. And one person in particular [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=672.32s)]
*  has done an extraordinary job leading NATO for the last decade, Secretary General Stoltenberg, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=679.28s)]
*  when he come forward. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=685.68s)]
*  So much of the progress we've made in the alliance is thanks to the Secretary. He's a man of integrity [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=699.68s)]
*  He's a man of integrity and intellectual rigor, a calm temperament in the moment of crisis. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=705.52s)]
*  A consummate diplomat who works with leaders across the political spectrum and always [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  finds a way to keep us moving forward. Secretary, you've guided this alliance through one of the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=718.08s)]
*  most consequential periods in its history. I realize, I was talking to your wife, I personally [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=723.2s)]
*  asked you to extend your service. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=729.6s)]
*  Forgive me. And you put your own plans on hold. When the Russian war in Ukraine began, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Z7hfIuO3o&t=733.6s)]
