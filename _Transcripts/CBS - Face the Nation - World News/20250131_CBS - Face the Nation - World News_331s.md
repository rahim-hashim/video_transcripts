# How Trumpâ€™s tariffs could impact the U.S. economy
**CBS - Face the Nation - World News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM)
*  Welcome back. Trump administration's sweeping tariffs on our three biggest trading partners, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=0.0s)]
*  Canada, Mexico, and China, set to go in effect tomorrow. I want to bring in David Wessel [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  for analysis. He's senior fellow for economic studies at the Brookings Institution, someone [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=10.24s)]
*  I've known for a long time and admired each and every year I've known him. David, this [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=14.64s)]
*  is no longer theoretical. Stock traders and economic analysts and others were saying, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=19.3s)]
*  Trump talks a big game, but it's not really going to happen or it won't happen to the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=27.16s)]
*  effect he promises. It sounds like it's going to. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=30.32s)]
*  That's absolutely right. I mean, we still don't know the details exactly what are these [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=34.36s)]
*  tariffs going to apply to. Is it everything? What is his objective here? It's very unusual [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=38.36s)]
*  to say we're going to use tariffs to get you to stop sending fentanyl precursors or people [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=43.32s)]
*  to the United States. So I think a lot of people are thinking, yeah, he's going to impose [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=47.8s)]
*  these tariffs. He's going to try and make a deal. On the other hand, we know that Mexico [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=52.36s)]
*  and Canada and perhaps even China are going to retaliate. So that's going to complicate [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=57.36s)]
*  things and may make life difficult for our exporters. He's trying to reduce our imports. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=62.68s)]
*  But remember, we export about 11 percent of GDP and that's going to be affected if these [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=68.28s)]
*  countries impose tariffs on our exports. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=73.76s)]
*  And David, as I looked at the numbers, let's just deal with Mexico for a second. One hundred [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=77.32s)]
*  and twenty nine billion dollars last year in autos or auto parts trade with Mexico. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=81.06s)]
*  Fifty percent of U.S. auto parts come to the United States either from Mexico or Canada. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  That's just one sector of the economy. People will feel this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=93.06s)]
*  Right. Absolutely. So it's very the auto industry is very integrated across Canada and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=97.1s)]
*  Mexico. So one question is, is the president really going to impose these tariffs on parts [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=104.3s)]
*  that are going back and forth to U.S. plants? Because that's that's going to be really [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=110.1s)]
*  disruptive. Or will he not? The other thing is we import a lot of fruit and vegetables for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=114.17999999999999s)]
*  Mexico and we don't have domestic suppliers in the winter who can supply those. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=118.78s)]
*  So people are going to see an increase in prices. I don't think it's going to be an [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=123.46s)]
*  enormous increase in the inflation rate. That'll be small. We only import about 15 percent [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  of GDP. But in specific sectors, this is going to be a real effect. And I expect Democrats [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=133.22s)]
*  are going to be calling attention every time a price goes up. They're going to blame it [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=138.58s)]
*  all on President Trump. And we'll see how he handles that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=142.74s)]
*  And David, let's talk about energy. As I understand it, Canada is the largest supplier of U.S. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=145.9s)]
*  energy imports on an annual basis. One point four billion barrels of crude oil. Sixty [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=152.58s)]
*  percent of our total imports last year came from Canada. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=158.38000000000002s)]
*  Right. But remember, the U.S. now produces more than enough oil to meet its own needs. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=161.9s)]
*  So we are now an oil exporter. The president seems to think that if by making it's kind of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=168.5s)]
*  weird because on one hand he wants to lower oil prices, but that's going to have less [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=176.74s)]
*  incentive for U.S. producers to drill. On the other hand, he wants to raise prices, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=181.1s)]
*  apparently, by taxing these imports, which will make it more attractive for American [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=186.82s)]
*  producers to drill. So it's very confusing. But again, it can only help increase prices. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=191.54s)]
*  And that's not what he ran on. So this is going to be really interesting over the next few weeks. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=197.78s)]
*  And David, what is your expectation based on what you've been reading, what you've been [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=202.54s)]
*  reporting, what you've been analyzing about the likely response from Canada, Mexico, China? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  I'm absolutely certain that Canada and Mexico will respond with compensatory tariffs. Whether [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=213.18s)]
*  they also make an offer to him to do something on immigration in fentanyl remains to be seen. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=219.9s)]
*  And I expect the same is true in the Chinese. I think the Chinese really hope they can make a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=225.98000000000002s)]
*  deal with President Trump. They think he's very transactional, and they're trying to find a way [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=230.54000000000002s)]
*  to defuse the thing. But I think they won't be afraid to block exports of things that we need [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=235.98s)]
*  from China, because we are dependent on China for a number of rare earths and stuff like that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=243.66s)]
*  And someday we may be domestic producers, but we're not yet. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=249.66s)]
*  And I have to believe, David, and I'd like your thoughts on this, that Canada and Mexico might [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=253.74s)]
*  reasonably say, Mr. President, not only are we your geographic neighbors, our economies are [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=258.7s)]
*  integrated, as you indicated, David, but if you're talking about fentanyl or trade deficits, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=264.78s)]
*  China is the much bigger problem. Much larger trade deficit in the U.S. to China than it has [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=269.5s)]
*  with Canada and Mexico. And fentanyl comes through Mexico to the United States, but it originates [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  many times in China. And yet China is getting the lesser of these tariffs to come. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=278.78s)]
*  Absolutely. And don't forget, we have a trade agreement, the U.S.MCA trade agreement, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  that President Trump negotiated. He took an old treaty and made it, but he said better. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=290.94s)]
*  And so we have this pact with them, and he's tearing it up. And you're absolutely right. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=296.38s)]
*  If our enemy is China, why are we going bigger tariffs on Mexico and Canada? And why are we [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=301.18s)]
*  spending all this time talking about DEI's if DEI was the one that was eroding American jobs? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=308.22s)]
*  It's really, really hard to figure out what the strategy is here. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=313.98s)]
*  We had Gremlins galore and David Wessel's zoom. That's not his fault or our fault. It's just [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=317.90000000000003s)]
*  Gremlins. They exist. They complicated the video just a little bit. David Wessel, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=323.26s)]
*  thanks for being with us. Hope to see you again. Thank you very much. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq4oo0ybIFM&t=327.18s)]
