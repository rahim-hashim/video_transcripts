Video Description: We take it for granted that entertainers can—and probably should—advocate for the causes they believe in, political and otherwise. That wasn’t always the case: at one time, entertainers were supposed to entertain, and little else. Harry Belafonte, who died on April 25th at the age of ninety-six, pioneered the artist-activist approach. One of the most celebrated singers of his era, he had a string of huge hits—“The Banana Boat Song,” “Mama Look a Boo Boo,” “Jamaica Farewell”—while appearing as the rare Black leading man in the movies. At the same time, Belafonte used his platform to influence public opinion. He was a key figure in the civil-rights movement, a confidant of Martin Luther King’s; a generation later, he worked with Nelson Mandela to help bring down apartheid in South Africa. Belafonte joined The New Yorker Radio Hour in 2016, when the staff writer Jelani Cobb (https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jelani-cobb) visited him at his office in Manhattan.

# Harry Belafonte, the Pioneering Artist-Activist
**New Yorker Radio Hour:** [April 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs)
*  This is the New Yorker Radio Hour, a co-production of WNYC Studios and The New Yorker. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the New Yorker Radio Hour. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=9.96s)]
*  I'm David Remnick. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=11.24s)]
*  We take it for granted today that entertainers can and maybe should speak out for the causes [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=12.9s)]
*  they believe in, political and otherwise. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=17.56s)]
*  That certainly wasn't the case in the past, but there was a great pioneer in this, the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=20.32s)]
*  artist activist Harry Belafonte, and he just died at the age of 96. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=25.6s)]
*  One of the great entertainers of his era, Belafonte had a long string of hits, the banana [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=31.36s)]
*  boat song, Jump in the Line, Jamaica Farewell. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=36.36s)]
*  Down the way where the nights are gay and the sun shines daily on the mountain top. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=40.32s)]
*  I took a trip on a sailing ship and when I reached Jamaica I made a stop but I'm sad [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=48.32s)]
*  to say. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=55.68s)]
*  As well as a career as a leading man in the movies. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=56.68s)]
*  But at the same time, Belafonte was a key figure in the civil rights movement, a friend [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=59.24s)]
*  and confidant of Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=64.28s)]
*  And a generation later, he worked with Nelson Mandela to help bring down apartheid. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=67.6s)]
*  In 2016, The New Yorker's Jelani Cobb went to pay him a visit at his office in Midtown [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=72.72s)]
*  Manhattan. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=77.84s)]
*  At the age of 90, Belafonte was still at work with his team planning the details of an upcoming [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=80.8s)]
*  festival. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  So Mr. Belafonte's office is like an archive. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=89.04s)]
*  When you walk in there are his gold records that are on the wall and then there are posters [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=94.92s)]
*  from some of his films and you kind of walk through his biography by looking at what's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=101.28s)]
*  on the walls. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=106.56s)]
*  When we got there, we talked for a moment with his daughter. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=108.44s)]
*  She's really heavily involved in working out the logistical details for the festival. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=112.36s)]
*  We were waiting for Mr. Belafonte to arrive and some people walk into a room and some [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=121.88s)]
*  people make an entrance. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=127.68s)]
*  At 89 years old, Harry Belafonte still makes an entrance. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=136.52s)]
*  I jokingly told him that a friend of mine, when I mentioned that I was going to be talking [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  to him, I asked her if there's anything that I should ask him for her. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=147.8s)]
*  And she said, yes, ask him if I can have his phone number. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=153.4s)]
*  And this is someone who was in her 30s. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  He walks with a cane and he's thinner than he has been in earlier points of his life. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  But there's still something really very dignified about him. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  Sir, it's good to see you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  I've discovered it's nice to see anybody. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  With Belafonte, it's like picking up an encyclopedia and flipping through the pages. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=181.48s)]
*  There's so much information there and there's so much lived experience. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  The fact that he owned a burger joint in the village at some point in his career when he [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=191.12s)]
*  was convinced that he wouldn't make it as an actor. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=195.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=198.6s)]
*  He didn't own it long because he wasn't bankrupt. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=199.6s)]
*  I didn't charge enough for the hamburgers. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=203.52s)]
*  Most of the people who came to eat in the restaurant were all my friends, acting students, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=206.84s)]
*  who also broke and said, I'll pay when I get from my next gig. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=212.48s)]
*  Well, I got a drawer full of next gigs. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  No money. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  But when you talk to him, he kind of grounds his sense of identity and everything he is. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  And being the child of two very hardworking but nonetheless disadvantaged West Indian [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=229.39999999999998s)]
*  immigrants. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=235.48s)]
*  That's a young person watching my mother go through the dignities of poverty. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=236.48s)]
*  She came home too often a broken person. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=241.72s)]
*  She stood in line down onto the L on Third Avenue to get day work. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=246.5s)]
*  And this is in Harlem? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=252.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=253.3s)]
*  Somebody said it was really interesting, which is that you said people think of you [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=254.3s)]
*  as an artist who became an activist, but you think of yourself as an activist who became [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=259.62s)]
*  an artist. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=264.58s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly correct. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=265.58s)]
*  When people say, when did you become an activist? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=271.84s)]
*  I just said, well, I don't know how you can ask citizens of color who were born into poverty, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=274.5s)]
*  when did you become an activist? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=281.94s)]
*  You really become an activist the day you're born, because your whole lust and thrust and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=284.06s)]
*  effort is to get out of poverty. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=290.18s)]
*  And that requires a lot of work. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=293.62s)]
*  One of the more notable things, I think, was the story he told about going to Mississippi [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=295.88s)]
*  with Sidney Poitier to bring $100,000 to civil rights activists there. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=301.5s)]
*  Sidney Poitier is, of course, the great African American actor and Harry Belafonte's oldest [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=310.38s)]
*  friend. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=316.1s)]
*  I called Sidney Poitier, which I'd been in the habit of doing, for us to go for fun and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=317.1s)]
*  games. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=323.22s)]
*  So he thought this was that kind of call. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=324.22s)]
*  So I called him and I said, I got to go down to Greenwood, Mississippi. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=327.14s)]
*  And there was this long pause. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=333.9s)]
*  Belafonte, what are you going to Greenwood, Mississippi for? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=335.9s)]
*  And I spelt it out. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=340.5s)]
*  And so on the face of it, it sounds absurd. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=342.74s)]
*  These are two of the most recognizable figures in Hollywood, in American culture at this [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=348.14s)]
*  And they are trying to organize a clandestine trip to Mississippi to funnel money to a civil [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=354.26s)]
*  rights organization that can't get it any other way. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  When we got to Greenwood, it was one of the darkest nights I'd ever remembered seeing [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=364.5s)]
*  no electricity at all in this little dirt airport. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=370.3s)]
*  And just at that moment, in a circle around the airfield, these lights went up. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=375.7s)]
*  In the distance, there were cars. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=382.74s)]
*  And I was with a guy named Willie Blue. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=384.74s)]
*  I had said to Sidney, I think those are the feds. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=387.22s)]
*  And Willie Blue said, feds my ass. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=390.5s)]
*  That's the Klan. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=393.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=394.18s)]
*  I looked at Sidney and he was not in a humorous mood. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=395.18s)]
*  There's just really kind of an amazing story and the dynamics between the two of them and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=400.42s)]
*  driving around in the middle of the night and being concerned that the Klan is going [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=405.90000000000003s)]
*  to come get them. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=408.78000000000003s)]
*  It's funny, but it's also poignant. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=410.7s)]
*  At 89 years old, it's very easy to just talk about life in the past tense. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=414.46s)]
*  But I think the other reason why I wanted to talk to Mr. Belafonte was the fact that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=421.65999999999997s)]
*  he is so deeply enmeshed in things that are contemporary and current. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=426.05999999999995s)]
*  He's not talking about things that happened in 1966, except as a means of shedding light [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=432.05999999999995s)]
*  on what happens in 2016. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=437.78000000000003s)]
*  Have you been surprised or dismayed by anything that's happened in our current politics that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=440.46000000000004s)]
*  makes this moment particularly important? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=449.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=454.02s)]
*  What really stuns me is the absence of black presence in the face of the kind of animus [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=456.86s)]
*  that's being heaped upon us. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=467.1s)]
*  To gerrymander voting districts, to change the voting zones, to close down privileges [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=469.54s)]
*  that are given to workers who Sundays and weekends to be able to vote. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=477.38s)]
*  This onslaught is all about race and there is no real substantial voice coming out of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=482.74s)]
*  the black movement. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=491.26s)]
*  Our organizations are fallow. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=492.90000000000003s)]
*  Where is SNCC? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=495.42s)]
*  Where is SCLC? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=496.42s)]
*  The NAACP? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=497.42s)]
*  It is the absence of black consciousness and black response to these things that I think [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=498.42s)]
*  that has ennobled people, emboldened them. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=508.94s)]
*  Black Lives Matter, I presume? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=518.58s)]
*  Black Lives Matter is something we created. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=520.38s)]
*  I'm thinking the Donald Trumps of the world. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=522.78s)]
*  Where's the black voice? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=526.14s)]
*  Where's the black congress? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=528.26s)]
*  Where are the committees? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=530.1s)]
*  Not individuals, but where's the collective? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=531.1s)]
*  We don't have a labor movement like we had when we did the march on Washington because [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=534.34s)]
*  labor movement by and large belly-upped. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=540.54s)]
*  There is no labor movement in this country. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=544.06s)]
*  There's a labor struggle, but there's no labor movement. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=547.22s)]
*  We have no peace movement. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=550.9s)]
*  What do you see the difference between those two things, a labor struggle and a labor movement? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=551.9s)]
*  A movement I think is an organized body with purpose, with declared targets, with clarity [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=555.82s)]
*  of philosophy, with an ideology. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=564.98s)]
*  A struggle is when somebody slaps you and you try to cover yourself from the blow. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=568.1s)]
*  There is no underbelly. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=573.94s)]
*  There's no grit. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=576.34s)]
*  There's no challenge. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=578.46s)]
*  And we certainly don't have the political leadership. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=579.46s)]
*  It's not in the White House. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=582.74s)]
*  It's not in the Congress. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=585.26s)]
*  I kind of welcome this. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=586.82s)]
*  Mr. Belafonte was trying to orient himself, I think, in time and in a kind of activist [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=587.82s)]
*  space. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=592.1s)]
*  He began talking about what he saw as the failures of organizations that were led by [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=593.1s)]
*  his contemporaries and that they left a void that had to be filled by other groups. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=598.0400000000001s)]
*  I think he was implying that the rise of things like Black Lives Matter was as a result of, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=605.2199999999999s)]
*  I think it's probably not too harsh to say, other people dropping the baton. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=612.18s)]
*  There is no voice that stands strong in leading some mighty response, some righteous response [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=616.54s)]
*  to what's going on. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=625.8199999999999s)]
*  I think it's important to recognize also the reverence that a lot of younger people have [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=628.38s)]
*  for Belafonte. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=633.8199999999999s)]
*  John Legend certainly is one of those people. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=637.18s)]
*  And then various voices and elements of Black Lives Matter that have been in dialogue with [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=639.8199999999999s)]
*  him. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=645.62s)]
*  And there is a cadre of younger artistic and activist people who see in Belafonte kind [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=646.62s)]
*  of a mentor figure, kind of one of the last vital links to the civil rights movement that [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=655.5s)]
*  much of this work is still inspired by. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=663.46s)]
*  And I'm not sure there's anyone else who quite occupies that niche. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=666.86s)]
*  When I listen to young people like Jesse Williams, when I listen to John Legend step in and speak [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=670.66s)]
*  out, I feel rewarded that somewhere along the line, these are the dividends for what [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=679.1s)]
*  we invested. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=687.38s)]
*  All my colleagues were now dead and gone because I now understand that I'm officially at the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=688.38s)]
*  end. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=700.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't want to do it anymore. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=701.1800000000001s)]
*  It was jarring to see him talk about the fact that we all have a finite amount of time here. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=704.66s)]
*  And he's thinking very much about what it is that he's done. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=711.62s)]
*  I am going to spend the rest of my days perhaps being more radical than I ever thought I would [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=716.3399999999999s)]
*  ever be, saying things that are more radical, because I no longer want to lead anything [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=723.9s)]
*  or be part. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=732.78s)]
*  I just want to say the truth and what it is. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=733.9s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff to be said. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=737.6999999999999s)]
*  Where I go with it, I don't know, but I'll be knocking at your door. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=742.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm always eager to talk to you, Mr. Belafonte. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=748.22s)]
*  My heart is down, my head is turning around. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=751.06s)]
*  I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=754.74s)]
*  The late Harry Belafonte. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=761.74s)]
*  He spoke with The New Yorker's Jelani Cobb in 2016. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=762.74s)]
*  That's the Radio Hour for today. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=766.66s)]
*  See you next time. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=768.78s)]
*  Sounds of laughter everywhere and the dancing girls swing to and fro. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=769.78s)]
*  The New Yorker Radio Hour is a co-production of WNYC Studios and The New Yorker. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iv3OQOFbEs&t=778.7s)]
