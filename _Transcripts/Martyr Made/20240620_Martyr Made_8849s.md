# Thoughts on Ukraine (Updated and Remastered)
**Martyr Made:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY)
*  Hey everybody, it is Daryl Cooper. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=0.0s)]
*  You are listening to the Martyr Made Podcast. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6.24s)]
*  Some of you heard this episode before. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=10.08s)]
*  I decided to re-record it to correct the audio issues that I had the first time around. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=11.88s)]
*  Some people said I should have just let it ride, but I don't know. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=18.44s)]
*  If you guys are going to give me your time, I need to have more respect for you than that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=21.04s)]
*  So I do apologize for the quality the first time around and I added a fair amount of new [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=24.52s)]
*  material that I thought of since I released the first version. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=29.9s)]
*  As you all know, Russia has invaded Ukraine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=34.5s)]
*  At the time that I'm releasing this, I guess it's now the 16th of March 2022, the war is [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=40.78s)]
*  ongoing and shows no signs of abating. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=47.34s)]
*  The Russian assault seems to be increasing in ferocity as Ukrainians put up a solid defense [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=53.019999999999996s)]
*  in many areas of the country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=59.18s)]
*  This is obviously the fog of war. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=60.58s)]
*  It's hard to tell what's going on, but things don't look great. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=62.86s)]
*  Several cities have been captured by the Russians. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=68.02s)]
*  The city of Kharkov is under attack in the east. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=72.42s)]
*  Mariupol in the south is surrounded and cut off. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=75.82s)]
*  A large force of Ukrainian soldiers seems to be mostly encircled in the east of the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=79.22s)]
*  country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=84.06s)]
*  The capital city of Kiev is nearly surrounded as well. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=85.06s)]
*  It's being bombarded the outer suburbs right now and nobody seems to be quite sure what [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=89.38s)]
*  the Russians intend for it, but I guess we'll find out soon enough. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=94.02s)]
*  Russian artillery and rockets and missiles and jets are hitting targets all over the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=99.98s)]
*  country every day, all the way over to the Polish border they're hitting targets. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=104.9s)]
*  Western governments have responded with unprecedented sanctions, the effects of which are likely [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=111.5s)]
*  to be grave for Russia and unpredictable for the rest of the world. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=116.78s)]
*  We've got important leaders in the United States and Europe calling for a no-fly zone [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=124.62s)]
*  to be set up over Ukraine, which would involve putting American pilots in direct combat with [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=131.5s)]
*  Russian pilots and air defenses and would require not only destroying Russian air defenses [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=139.06s)]
*  that are in Ukraine, but Russian air defense batteries that are in Belarus and Russia as well. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=144.98s)]
*  Many of you asked me to share my thoughts on this crisis and that's what this episode is. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=154.73999999999998s)]
*  It is different from most other episodes that I release on the Maine Martyr Made feed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  It's not one of my really long, in-depth, all sides of the issue type of episodes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=163.85999999999999s)]
*  I put it together pretty quickly. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=171.62s)]
*  I wanted to get it out to you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=172.94s)]
*  I draw on the work of other people when I can, when they echo my own thinking. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=175.34s)]
*  I don't pretend that this is the final word on anything contained in this podcast. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=181.7s)]
*  There's a lot more to say. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=184.94s)]
*  I want to thank everybody for your patience the last few weeks. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=186.9s)]
*  I know I've been a little bit out of commission. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=190.66s)]
*  I took a short vacation, just great timing there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=193.06s)]
*  I've just been slammed since I got back. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=196.78s)]
*  We flew in three guys for a Jocko podcast episode I put together. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=200.26000000000002s)]
*  I flew in another guy, Scott Horton. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=204.26000000000002s)]
*  Some of you may have heard that episode for an unraveling. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=206.86s)]
*  Now I'm preparing for an interview with Tucker Carlson, full hour interview on his show Tucker [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=211.26000000000002s)]
*  Carlson Today at the end of this month. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=216.74s)]
*  That's pretty scary. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=220.62s)]
*  I'm a little focused on that right now. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=221.62s)]
*  Anyway, this episode is the kind of thing that I would normally release on the sub stack [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=225.46s)]
*  to subscribers only. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=229.42s)]
*  So if you can spare $5 a month to help feed your favorite podcasters favorite podcaster, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  please do consider subscribing at martyrmade.substack.com. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=238.14s)]
*  But for this episode, I promised you guys I would put it out for gen pop. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=244.78s)]
*  And so here you go. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=248.86s)]
*  These are my thoughts on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=250.7s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=254.38s)]
*  It is a place. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=280.7s)]
*  It is somewhere. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=283.9s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=285.9s)]
*  But its reference is to something that transcends all things. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=289.9s)]
*  I must tear ourselves apart for this small question of religion. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=295.9s)]
*  Well, as I said in the intro, I did pick the wrong week to go on vacation up in the mountains. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=305.9s)]
*  This isn't what I planned on talking about this week. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=317.73999999999995s)]
*  I had something else queued up. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=321.41999999999996s)]
*  In fact, I've got a lot of other things that I that I'd like to be talking about. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=322.85999999999996s)]
*  But like many of you, I have not really been able to think about really anything except [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=326.85999999999996s)]
*  for what's going on in Ukraine. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=331.41999999999996s)]
*  And to be honest, it's been a little bit paralyzing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=334.78s)]
*  I just look around and I don't like anything that I am seeing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=339.82s)]
*  I have a very, very bad feeling about everything I am seeing from just about everybody. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=345.82s)]
*  And it includes Putin, of course. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=351.82s)]
*  But I don't like what I'm seeing from Western leaders, American and European. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=355.29999999999995s)]
*  I don't like what I'm seeing from the media. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=360.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't like what I'm seeing from the American and European publics in general. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=363.74s)]
*  I see people panicking. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=369.58s)]
*  I see a lot of building just vitriolic, irrational hatred and impulsiveness and vindictiveness [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=373.14s)]
*  and and a group think on this issue that is policed more aggressively than anything I [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=380.82s)]
*  saw in the lead up to the 2003 Iraq War, which was pretty bad. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=388.58s)]
*  These headlines are from just the last week, week and a half. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=394.38s)]
*  The Canadian Hockey League bans Russian 16 and 17 year olds from draft. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=397.38s)]
*  German Clinic refuses to treat Russian patients. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=403.14s)]
*  Russian piano prodigies performances canceled despite denouncing invasion. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=407.34s)]
*  Daniel Medvedev, the world's number one tennis player, could face a ban from Wimbledon unless [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=413.62s)]
*  he provides public assurances that he is not a supporter of President Putin. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=419.26s)]
*  This isn't a guy who's been out there taking pictures with Putin and kissing his feet. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=424.78000000000003s)]
*  They're just going to him and say, you better give us these assurances or else. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=431.58000000000004s)]
*  Italy's main university in Milan banned teaching Dostoevsky. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=438.5s)]
*  They walked that one back, but other places are banning Tchaikovsky and Tolstoy. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=442.02s)]
*  Come on. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=446.78s)]
*  Every time in history that this has ever happened before, we wake up a little while later and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=448.14s)]
*  realize that we lost our minds for a little while there and that the people doing it were [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=454.62s)]
*  in fact the bad guys every time. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  This time will be no different. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=464.14s)]
*  And a lot of the people who are cheering this stuff on right now are going to be denying [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=465.74s)]
*  ever supporting it for long. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=469.58s)]
*  Headline from The Hill, Facebook, Instagram to allow calls for violence against Russians [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=473.5s)]
*  temporarily. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=479.02s)]
*  From Reuters, Facebook owner Metta is also temporarily allowing some posts that call [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=481.3s)]
*  for death to Russian President Putin or Belarusian President Lukashenko, according to internal [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=486.9s)]
*  emails to its content moderators. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=492.62s)]
*  From The Intercept, Facebook lifts ban on Ukraine's neo-Nazi Azov battalion. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=496.5s)]
*  Until the other day, Facebook didn't allow support of the Azov battalion, just like they [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=504.9s)]
*  don't allow posts in support of the KKK. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=510.56s)]
*  But now they're killing people that we've decided we hate, along with the Jews and other [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=513.66s)]
*  groups that were already on their shit list. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=518.58s)]
*  So apparently it's all good. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=520.72s)]
*  I read that Western governments are just seizing the property of Russians abroad. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=524.74s)]
*  No accusations of any wrongdoing, no semblance of due process. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=529.98s)]
*  They're judged to have ties to the Putin regime as if any ultra wealthy person with global [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=535.1800000000001s)]
*  operations is not tied in one way or another to their government. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=540.14s)]
*  Most countries around the world vehemently opposed our invasion of Iraq, but you didn't [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=544.86s)]
*  see France seizing the property of American private citizens over it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=550.5s)]
*  You've got do-nothing senators like Mitt Romney, that vulture capitalist who took four deferments [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=556.3s)]
*  to avoid the Vietnam War, calling US Army Lieutenant Colonel Tulsi Gabbard, who served [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=562.32s)]
*  multiple tours in Iraq, a traitor. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=568.18s)]
*  You've got people on mainstream television, mainstream daytime television, saying that [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=573.82s)]
*  Tucker Carlson and Tulsi Gabbard need to be investigated and possibly jailed. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=579.54s)]
*  And so things are just going great over here, guys. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=586.3s)]
*  Just going great in our rational and tolerant liberal democracies where we don't do things [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=589.3399999999999s)]
*  like ascribe collective guilt to whole populations. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=596.06s)]
*  As I said, I've already recorded this once and some people told me not to do it again [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=601.3199999999999s)]
*  because I would lose some of the emotion that I had in the first one. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=605.38s)]
*  And I can already tell you that's not going to be an issue. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=608.86s)]
*  I was a little worried about that, but my blood's warming up just reading those headlines. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=610.66s)]
*  Now, those of you who follow me on Twitter know that I have something of a contrarian [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=615.62s)]
*  take on this whole situation, to say the least. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=620.5s)]
*  For starters, I don't like war. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=624.14s)]
*  That might have been different at a different period in my life, but I'm past that part [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=627.38s)]
*  of my life. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=630.54s)]
*  I don't like war. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=631.54s)]
*  I especially don't like wars between cousins and I really don't like wars that could have [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=632.54s)]
*  been easily avoided. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=638.26s)]
*  Now right here at the beginning, let's just get a few things out of the way. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=643.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=646.22s)]
*  Vladimir Putin made the decision to invade Ukraine and the responsibility for this war [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=647.22s)]
*  falls on him. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=652.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=653.98s)]
*  I'm going to say that as clearly as I can say it, but as Scott Horton recently put it, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=654.98s)]
*  while Putin's responsible for this current round of violence in Ukraine, a good deal [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=660.14s)]
*  of the responsibility for this new cold war in which the current fighting has its context [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=665.56s)]
*  falls on us, on the United States. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=670.28s)]
*  And in this episode, I'm going to try to explain why it is that I feel that way. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=672.84s)]
*  The first time around, the first time I recorded this, some people objected that I wasn't presenting [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=680.16s)]
*  a full picture here and those people are correct. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=685.2s)]
*  What I try to do in this episode is to provide the other side of the story that you're already [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=689.36s)]
*  getting on every TV channel and every newspaper and every magazine and from every politician. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=693.72s)]
*  The information here is not supposed to be taken as a replacement for what you're seeing [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=700.32s)]
*  on the news. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=705.0400000000001s)]
*  It's supposed to be a supplement. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=707.2s)]
*  Something I said at the end, the first time around, I want to say upfront this time, this [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=710.36s)]
*  episode is not really even about Russia or Ukraine. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=715.96s)]
*  It's about the United States, my country, and whether we ought to be able to look ourselves [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=720.16s)]
*  in the mirror and say with a straight face that at least we did everything on our end [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=725.48s)]
*  to avoid this horrible situation, all this death and destruction, not to mention the [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=731.7199999999999s)]
*  threat of escalation to great power war, or whether we have done just about everything [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=736.26s)]
*  in our power to egg it on and make it worse. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=742.4s)]
*  There was a time not very long ago when you would hear our leaders talk about something [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=748.16s)]
*  called strategic empathy. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=753.7199999999999s)]
*  That doesn't mean agreeing with the other side's position. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=757.52s)]
*  It means understanding it so that when we go out and make decisions, we're actually [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=760.8199999999999s)]
*  dealing in reality. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=765.12s)]
*  The great Cold War diplomat George Kennan wrote his famous long telegram in 1946 in [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=769.3199999999999s)]
*  which he laid out the containment policy that ended up defining our Cold War strategy. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=775.2s)]
*  But a year later when he was the first director of the Office of Policy Planning, just before [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=780.12s)]
*  he became the ambassador to the Soviet Union, he wrote it up as an anonymous article for [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=784.32s)]
*  Foreign Affairs Magazine and he titled it, The Sources of Soviet Conduct. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=790.46s)]
*  The sources of Soviet conduct. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=795.8000000000001s)]
*  And Kennan, who knew the Soviet Union as well or better than anyone in the upper echelons [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=798.0s)]
*  of U.S. policy circles at the time, spent much of the article trying to correct the [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=803.0600000000001s)]
*  almost complete ignorance of American policymakers regarding the motivations of the Soviet communists. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=808.0600000000001s)]
*  To explain to people how they saw the world and the geopolitical situation, what their [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=815.0600000000001s)]
*  priorities and their goals were. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=820.86s)]
*  And when he did that, he wasn't called a Stalin apologist or a Soviet sympathizer. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=824.66s)]
*  And if you called George Kennan a traitor, he probably would have laid you out. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=830.74s)]
*  Since the rise of the third generation neoconservatives in the 1990s, strategic empathy is out the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=836.66s)]
*  window. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=843.46s)]
*  Not only has it been thrown out the window, but anybody who tries to reintroduce it or [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=845.1800000000001s)]
*  any kind of nuance into situations like this are attacked as Saddam apologists or Assadists [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=849.54s)]
*  or Putin apologists or Gaddafi lovers or bin Laden apologists, whoever the Hitler of the [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=857.14s)]
*  moment is, because that's how neocons see the war hold. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=861.46s)]
*  Every enemy is Hitler. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=864.74s)]
*  Anyone who tries to understand the adversary's perspective is a Nazi sympathizer. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=867.1s)]
*  And leaders have a binary choice. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=874.1s)]
*  You can either be a weak appeaser like Chamberlain or a brave stalwart like Churchill. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=876.14s)]
*  Those are your two options. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=880.74s)]
*  It's this Manichaean cartoonish and above all, cynical way of looking at the world. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=881.74s)]
*  But it's a very effective way of getting what you want, which is why the neocons, who are [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=889.5s)]
*  relatively small in number, have gotten their way on most foreign policy questions over [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=894.26s)]
*  the last 30 years. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=898.7s)]
*  They did the same thing before the second Iraq war. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=903.62s)]
*  Just as we were launching ourselves into that disaster, David Frum, one of the nastiest [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=906.7s)]
*  parasites attached to the American body politic, wrote an article for National Review called [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=912.5s)]
*  Unpatriotic Conservatives, in which he denounced and effectively excommunicated any conservative [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=918.86s)]
*  thinker who tried to keep us out of that catastrophe. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=926.6s)]
*  David Frum wasn't even an American. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=930.1400000000001s)]
*  He didn't get his dual citizenship until 2007, and yet he was able to drive good men, good [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=932.22s)]
*  patriotic men like Pat Buchanan and Justin Raimondo, Thomas Fleming, guys with more patriotism, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=938.7s)]
*  not to mention intelligence in their little finger than Frum has in his entire family [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=945.94s)]
*  line. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=950.26s)]
*  He was able to drive them out of polite company. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=951.26s)]
*  And of course, it turned out that they were right and he was wrong. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=954.9s)]
*  And the war that he was being paid to help lie us into was a disaster. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=959.58s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=962.5400000000001s)]
*  Those guys are still banned from polite company. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=964.14s)]
*  And David Frum has spent the last 20 years getting paid to accuse people of being Gaddafi [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=966.98s)]
*  lovers for not wanting to destroy Libya or Assadists for not wanting to destroy Syria. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=972.5400000000001s)]
*  And now Putin apologists for wanting to de-escalate this situation with Russia. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=977.76s)]
*  These people don't even bother arguing their points. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=983.5400000000001s)]
*  They just accuse and insult their opponents, threaten them, and let everybody else know [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=987.14s)]
*  that that's what they're going to get if they speak up. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=992.18s)]
*  And they do it because it works. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=994.58s)]
*  It worked in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=996.7s)]
*  It worked during the Red Scares of the 20th century. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1000.06s)]
*  It worked to get us into Iraq, and it's working pretty well right now. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1002.3s)]
*  And today dissenters have more avenues to express themselves, thanks to the advent of [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1005.9s)]
*  the internet. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1011.86s)]
*  These people are doing everything that they can to censor people and regain their monopoly [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1012.94s)]
*  over the narrative. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1016.62s)]
*  Well screw David Frum and the caribou he rode in on. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1018.82s)]
*  So far, Substack has stood tall in their commitment to free speech. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1022.7s)]
*  And so I'm going to say my piece. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1025.66s)]
*  Now you ready? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1028.8600000000001s)]
*  Are you sitting down in your safe space? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1031.14s)]
*  Take a breath. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1034.26s)]
*  Here goes. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1035.26s)]
*  Putin is not Hitler, actually. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1036.9s)]
*  However, Hitler is a decent place to start this discussion because I think it's really [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1041.4199999999998s)]
*  hard to avoid a lot of comparisons between what has happened between Russia and the West [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1047.5s)]
*  since the end of the Cold War and what happened between Germany and the countries that won [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1053.6599999999999s)]
*  the First World War in the 1920s and 1930s. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1058.3799999999999s)]
*  Let's start with Germany. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1062.1399999999999s)]
*  It's 1918. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1064.3799999999999s)]
*  The war is turning against the Germans, but the fight is far from over. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1066.3s)]
*  The Germans had the capacity to potentially fight on for quite a while. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1073.22s)]
*  Some people think years. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1078.4199999999998s)]
*  Of course, that would have bled the Germans white, but it would have bled the other side [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1081.1s)]
*  too. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1084.34s)]
*  And they had already seen the stress of war cause Russia to collapse, take them out of [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1085.34s)]
*  the war. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1088.98s)]
*  The French army came so close to mutiny in 1917 that their generals told the British [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1091.22s)]
*  that they were done going on the offensive for the foreseeable future. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1095.62s)]
*  So the Germans could have kept things going in the hope that maybe the other side would [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1099.26s)]
*  break first. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1102.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, the Russians are out of the war. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1103.8999999999999s)]
*  France might not be able to take another Verdun or two. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1106.06s)]
*  You would have cost both sides millions more lives. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1109.8999999999999s)]
*  Instead, the Germans agreed to an armistice, believing Woodrow Wilson's rhetoric about [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1113.82s)]
*  peace without victory and so forth to 14 points. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1119.5s)]
*  And part of the reason they stood down was that they expected and were given every reason [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1123.94s)]
*  to expect that they would be able to negotiate a just peace in good faith, something that [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1128.46s)]
*  would not be on the table if they made the Allies fight their way all the way to Berlin, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1135.5s)]
*  as they did the second time around. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1140.98s)]
*  And so the Germans begin to demobilize. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1143.74s)]
*  But instead of standing down, the British Navy keeps in place its starvation blockade [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1147.42s)]
*  of German ports. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1152.06s)]
*  Most estimates are that between 600 and 800 thousand Germans died of starvation and diseases [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1155.58s)]
*  related to malnutrition, including some 80,000 children. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1163.94s)]
*  I mean, that's merely if you were to just proportion it to the population of the United [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1167.5s)]
*  States today, that would be like losing three or four million people. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1172.7s)]
*  It's about three times as many people starving to death proportionally as died from COVID-19 [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1177.14s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1186.0600000000002s)]
*  It's a greater percentage of the population than we lost to the Spanish flu pandemic. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1188.0200000000002s)]
*  The Germans laid down their arms thinking they were going to be going into treaty negotiations [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1192.26s)]
*  as junior partners. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1197.7800000000002s)]
*  Junior, for sure, but partners. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1199.7800000000002s)]
*  But instead they were treated as if they had made the Allies fight tooth and nail all the [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1203.66s)]
*  way to Berlin, and then finally submitted to an unconditional surrender. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1207.46s)]
*  The British kept the blockade in place until the Versailles Treaty was secured in 1919. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1213.02s)]
*  It's like eight months after the war was over, essentially threatening Germany with more [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1217.3000000000002s)]
*  starved children if they didn't accept the terms that were being imposed. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1221.18s)]
*  Winston Churchill told Parliament, quote, We are holding all our means of coercion in [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1227.18s)]
*  full operation or in immediate readiness for use. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1232.22s)]
*  We are enforcing the blockade with vigor. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1235.66s)]
*  We have strong armies ready to advance at the shortest notice. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1238.3s)]
*  Germany is very near starvation. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1241.8600000000001s)]
*  The evidence I have received from the officers sent by the war office all over Germany shows, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1244.5s)]
*  first of all, the great privations which the German people are suffering. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1249.3400000000001s)]
*  And secondly, the great danger of a collapse of the entire structure of German social and [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1253.78s)]
*  national life under the pressure of hunger and malnutrition. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1259.34s)]
*  Now is therefore the moment to settle. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1263.6599999999999s)]
*  End quote. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1266.26s)]
*  So again, the blockade was kept in place for eight months after the war was over, never [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1269.6599999999999s)]
*  mind the fact that there had been a revolution that overthrew the Kaiser. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1273.5s)]
*  So the government that the Allies had been fighting this whole time was out of the picture. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1277.02s)]
*  The Kaiser moved to the Netherlands, lived out his days comfortably, hunting and going [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1282.1799999999998s)]
*  out on archaeological digs. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1286.94s)]
*  The punitive Versailles Treaty didn't target the Kaiser, didn't target his government. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1290.18s)]
*  It targeted the German people themselves, the people who had been conscripted into the [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1295.3400000000001s)]
*  Emperor's Army, same as the British and French and Russian soldiers. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1300.46s)]
*  Many, many, many of the most experienced strategic thinkers at the time, economic thinkers, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1305.6200000000001s)]
*  too, denounced the Versailles Treaty. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1310.8600000000001s)]
*  The US Senate refused to ratify it, saying it was guaranteeing another war in some time [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1313.54s)]
*  in the future with a bitter and resentful Germany. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1319.94s)]
*  But those people were denounced as weak, need, hun loving borderline traitors. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1322.54s)]
*  And the people who wanted to keep Germany's face in the mud got their way. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1327.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, of course, the 1920s turned into a complete disaster for Germany. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1334.7s)]
*  While the rest of the Western world was celebrating their victory and the roaring economy of that [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1339.54s)]
*  decade, the German economy and its civil society just collapsed completely when they hyperinflated [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1344.98s)]
*  their currency to try to keep up with the reparations that were being imposed by the [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1352.1399999999999s)]
*  Allies. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1355.74s)]
*  And hyperinflation is one of the worst things that can ever happen to a society. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1356.74s)]
*  There's a good book about the Weimar hyperinflation called, what is it, When Money Dies by Adolf [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1362.1399999999999s)]
*  Adam Ferguson. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1368.5s)]
*  You can check that out if you want an idea of the damage that it does. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1369.5s)]
*  You've probably seen pictures from the Weimar hyperinflation where people are going to buy [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1374.62s)]
*  bread with literal wheelbarrows full of cash, or else they're using cash as toilet paper [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1378.1s)]
*  because it was cheaper than buying actual toilet paper or anything else. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1383.7s)]
*  That's how worthless the Deutschmark had become as a result, as a direct result of conditions [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1387.22s)]
*  imposed by a treaty that pretty much every German, and I mean right, left, center, communist, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1395.14s)]
*  capitalist, nationalist, every German felt was forced on them under the gun after they [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1401.22s)]
*  had been tricked into laying down their arms. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1406.8200000000002s)]
*  One of the purposes of the treaty was to ensure that Germany no longer had the ability to [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1412.94s)]
*  wage war. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1417.74s)]
*  So in addition to preventing them from having a military, at a time when the Soviet Union [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1419.1799999999998s)]
*  was tooling up just to the east, the Allies stripped Germany of a lot of its territory [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1424.62s)]
*  to create new countries that were hostile to or afraid of Germany, like Poland and Czechoslovakia. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1429.1399999999999s)]
*  These territories cut 10% of Germany's ethnic German population out of Germany, making them [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1437.1799999999998s)]
*  citizens all of a sudden of new countries with a stroke of a pen. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1443.8799999999999s)]
*  Every German suddenly had a cousin or a friend or a friend of a friend who was now a foreigner, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1449.08s)]
*  and pretty much every German on both sides of these new borders experienced this as an [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1455.28s)]
*  extreme injustice. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1459.1999999999998s)]
*  The Weimar government pretty much forfeited all credibility before it ever even got started [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1463.1999999999998s)]
*  because it happened to be the government when these terms were forced on Germany. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1469.36s)]
*  By the time you get to 1933 when the Nazis take power, people were ready to accept pretty [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1474.84s)]
*  much anything other than the Weimar government. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1479.48s)]
*  As a result, this terrible situation developed from which you can draw a direct line to the [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1483.24s)]
*  Second World War. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1489.08s)]
*  You had this new Weimar German state, but all around it, right on the other side of [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1491.54s)]
*  the border, were millions of these ethnic Germans who constituted a supermajority in [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1496.52s)]
*  these regions of their new countries. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1501.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, Germany would have liked to have those people back. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1504.72s)]
*  Most of those people wanted to be back in Germany. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1507.56s)]
*  So naturally, the majority populations in those countries, the Poles, the Czechoslovaks, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1510.92s)]
*  et cetera, these are people who had been subjects of the Kaiserreich until yesterday. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1515.64s)]
*  They were very jealous of their independence for good reason, but they looked askance at [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1520.28s)]
*  their new ethnic German populations as potential fifth columnists. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1524.48s)]
*  Of course, a situation like that tends to become self-fulfilling. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1530.52s)]
*  The majority population doesn't trust the ethnic Germans. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1535.4s)]
*  The ethnic Germans sense that and become more alienated from the broader society and say, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1539.0s)]
*  see, this just proves that we're not real citizens of Poland and that we belong in Germany. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1543.8799999999999s)]
*  What's Poland supposed to do with a population who would probably break away if they could? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1549.48s)]
*  You start seeing official and unofficial discrimination against Germans manifesting in various ways. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1555.24s)]
*  Once that starts happening, it alienates the Germans even more. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1560.44s)]
*  It makes the Germans in Germany even more determined to bring their exiled brethren [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1565.48s)]
*  back into the fold, if only to get them out from under a society and a government that's [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1569.56s)]
*  perceived as hostile to them. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1574.72s)]
*  Then hostility was often exaggerated, but I get that's natural too. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1577.4s)]
*  Things start to happen. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1582.44s)]
*  People are going to tell stories. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1583.44s)]
*  Rumors are going to start. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1584.44s)]
*  natural and in any way was partly true. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1586.44s)]
*  Germans celebrated when Hitler brought the Sudetenland Germans and the Austrians back [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1591.0800000000002s)]
*  into the Reich. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1595.16s)]
*  German papers were full of lurid stories about Polish persecution of Polish Germans for months [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1597.04s)]
*  before Hitler used it as a Casus Belli to invade. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1602.68s)]
*  Get back to the hyperinflation of 1923. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1608.3600000000001s)]
*  When I say it laid waste to Germany, it's people lost everything. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1611.52s)]
*  Try to imagine that you're 60, 65 years old, been working your whole life, you saved your [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1617.0s)]
*  pennies for retirement. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1622.7s)]
*  I'll just put it in American currency terms to make it more familiar. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1624.2s)]
*  You've got $500,000 put away in a 401k and a pension of say $1,000 a month squirreled [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1629.0s)]
*  away. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1635.76s)]
*  So you're not rich, but you're going to make it. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1637.04s)]
*  You're going to keep a roof over your head until, you know, until the final day is the [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1641.08s)]
*  fruit of your life's labor. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1646.44s)]
*  You've got what you need to survive until the lights go out. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1647.8799999999999s)]
*  And then practically overnight, I mean, really a loaf of bread cost $10 billion. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1650.96s)]
*  What's your little $500,000 nest egg and $1,000 pension worth now? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1659.64s)]
*  I mean, literally nothing. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1663.84s)]
*  And this happened to virtually the entire German middle class. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1666.84s)]
*  They were completely wiped out right on the heels of a war that killed about one in six [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1671.8799999999999s)]
*  military age German men. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1678.06s)]
*  And people who had watched their children starve just a few years back now watch their [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1680.44s)]
*  elderly parents lose their savings and get put out on the street because they had to [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1685.56s)]
*  sell the house for a pittance along with any other hard assets and personal belongings [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1689.48s)]
*  that they had just to feed themselves. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1694.04s)]
*  And you might ask if the money had no value, what were people buying your parents' house [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1697.64s)]
*  and your mother's jewelry with? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1701.72s)]
*  Well, the people they were forced to sell to were those who had access to outside capital, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1703.84s)]
*  you know, dollars or British pounds, whatever. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1709.88s)]
*  So if you had a relative in the United States and could get them to send you a hundred bucks, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1713.32s)]
*  you were suddenly a king in a land with no other money. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1718.62s)]
*  And people did do that on the individual level, but it wasn't just people. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1723.5s)]
*  It was institutional. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1727.1s)]
*  Western banks were hiring local agents to go out all over Germany to buy up real estate [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1728.9399999999998s)]
*  and businesses and, you know, anything, jewelry, furniture, or anything that held value from [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1735.9799999999998s)]
*  these desperate people who needed something to eat just to get through the next month. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1741.1799999999998s)]
*  Now make no mistake about it. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1746.7s)]
*  Most middle-class German Jews got their faces ripped off by the hyperinflation as much as [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1748.98s)]
*  any ethnic German. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1755.18s)]
*  But the unfortunate fact is that a lot of the people who were buying this stuff up at [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1757.3400000000001s)]
*  pennies on the dollar happened to be Jewish just for the simple reason that Jews have [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1762.26s)]
*  a lot of relatives in other countries. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1767.46s)]
*  There were people spread out all over the world, so they were able to draw on connections [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1769.3s)]
*  abroad to access foreign currency when nobody else was able to. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1773.5s)]
*  And so while the German middle class, again, including most of the German Jewish middle [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1778.82s)]
*  class, was completely destroyed, some people were getting obscenely rich by buying up the [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1783.1s)]
*  German economy for next to nothing. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1789.74s)]
*  And of course, this led to a tremendous amount of resentment. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1792.1s)]
*  The 1935 anti-Jewish Nuremberg laws passed by the Nazi regime included things like not [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1797.42s)]
*  allowing German women to work as servants in Jewish households. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1804.26s)]
*  Now people usually think of this as just reflecting the Nazis' paranoia about, you know, Jewish [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1808.8200000000002s)]
*  sexual proclivities in the Nazis' way of looking at things. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1813.78s)]
*  But while that might have been part of the motivation, the real drive behind it was the [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1818.68s)]
*  fact that there were a lot of German women working as servants for wealthy Jews, many [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1823.26s)]
*  of whom were perceived to have made their money by joining with foreign financial institutions [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1829.02s)]
*  to loot the German economy. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1833.26s)]
*  Now of course, that does not excuse the Nazis' anti-Semitism. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1835.26s)]
*  That's not what this is about. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1839.9s)]
*  It's just to say that the actions taken by the Allies in the aftermath of the war helped [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1841.44s)]
*  to create the conditions in which many average Germans would listen to what the Nazis had [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1847.62s)]
*  to say. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1852.02s)]
*  Of course, you have to be careful with historical analogies, but sometimes you really can learn [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1855.26s)]
*  something about the present and the future by looking at the past. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1859.5s)]
*  And I think that the similarities to what happened with Russia after the Cold War ended [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1863.3s)]
*  in 1991 are too obvious to ignore. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1867.7s)]
*  And start with how the Cold War ended. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1872.1s)]
*  Ronald Reagan begins negotiating an end to the Cold War with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1874.74s)]
*  in 1988. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1879.6s)]
*  Gorbachev begins opening the USSR up not only to the outside world, but also opening things [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1882.32s)]
*  up within its own borders, starting to allow things that were forbidden before, things [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1888.6s)]
*  like that. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1893.56s)]
*  The first part of David Remnick's really great book, Lenin's Tomb, is all about those very [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1896.28s)]
*  early days of glasnost when the Russians, the Russian people were not really sure what [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1901.9399999999998s)]
*  to make of it. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1907.32s)]
*  Many of them thought it was like a trick or something. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1908.52s)]
*  Once the people who dared to go out and start saying things that would have gotten them [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1912.04s)]
*  in trouble before, then the curtain would come down and the authorities would round [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1917.44s)]
*  them all up. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1920.92s)]
*  Well, it turned out not to be a trick. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1921.92s)]
*  And it became apparent very quickly that glasnost had unleashed a sleeping beast and that it [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1924.72s)]
*  was opening up enough room for nationalists and other dissidents that there was a real [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1931.52s)]
*  chance it was going to lead to the dissolution of the Soviet Union altogether. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1937.76s)]
*  Now Gorbachev could have called in the tanks. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1942.68s)]
*  He could have called in airstrikes. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1946.96s)]
*  He thought about it at first. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1949.72s)]
*  In the very early stages, he took some steps to nip it in the bud, but he didn't escalate [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1951.0s)]
*  as the dissolution accelerated. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1957.28s)]
*  If he had, it might not have worked to save the USSR in the end, but there were still [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1960.8s)]
*  people willing to kill and die for the Soviet Union, for their country as they saw it, and [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1966.08s)]
*  it could have gotten very ugly and very dangerous. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1970.84s)]
*  But in 1989, when the Berlin Wall came down, he didn't call in the tanks and the USSR acquiesced [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1973.28s)]
*  to a massive, massive concession, especially when you consider the history of how the whole [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1981.52s)]
*  Warsaw Pact NATO world order came into existence. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1988.52s)]
*  Mikhail Gorbachev agreed not to resist the reunification of Germany and to go along with [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1992.16s)]
*  its entry into NATO. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=1998.72s)]
*  Just a massive concession. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2002.5600000000002s)]
*  And then what did we do? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2004.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, we followed the path laid down by the Allies treatment of Germany after the First [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2008.4s)]
*  World War, pretty much to a tee, taking advantage of the opportunity to put our foot on Russia's [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2013.88s)]
*  neck geopolitically and to engage in probably the single biggest looting operation since [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2019.84s)]
*  the Protestant Reformation. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2027.04s)]
*  I suggest everybody read up a little on what happened to Russia in the 1990s. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2029.84s)]
*  It is shocking. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2035.04s)]
*  And more than that, it's a disgraceful episode in America's foreign relations. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2037.1999999999998s)]
*  And some of you have asked for a reading list on this, so I'll put one together and post [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2041.4399999999998s)]
*  it on the substack. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2044.8s)]
*  As far as the economy, what happened in Russia in the 1990s had many similarities to what [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2048.28s)]
*  happened in Germany the first time around. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2053.0800000000004s)]
*  Not identical, but many similarities. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2055.0s)]
*  Western banks descended like vultures on the corpse of the USSR, sending in agents to go [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2057.5600000000004s)]
*  make contacts in Russia to make sure that they got a piece of this gigantic economy [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2063.44s)]
*  as it was transitioning from communism to capitalism. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2068.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, just imagine you're talking about a huge developed industrialized country with [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2072.6s)]
*  assets worth trillions, in at least today's dollars, that were about to be up for grabs. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2078.68s)]
*  Under the Soviet system, there was a command economy. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2086.48s)]
*  The state owned all the important industries. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2089.52s)]
*  Now they needed to transition away from that to a system where all of it would be owned [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2092.3199999999997s)]
*  by private individuals and operated as profit-making enterprises, just like they do here. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2096.32s)]
*  Well, the Russians asked some prominent Western economists, who had already helped Poland [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2102.1600000000003s)]
*  through a similar transition with some success, to now come over to Russia and show them how [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2105.88s)]
*  to do it. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2110.2000000000003s)]
*  And one of the main guys that they called in was the Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2112.0s)]
*  I think he might have been at Columbia at the time. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2116.2400000000002s)]
*  I should have looked that up. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2118.6400000000003s)]
*  Sachs has been demonized by critics of shock therapy as this process of privatization is [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2120.52s)]
*  called, but I think mostly unfairly. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2125.52s)]
*  Sachs and others had already run the same playbook in Poland, privatized the economy [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2128.84s)]
*  while loans and other aid from the IMF helped smooth out the bumps in the road. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2134.28s)]
*  And he went to Russia with the intention to do the same thing. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2140.28s)]
*  Now just think about what a historic opportunity this was. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2145.2s)]
*  You listen to Jeffrey Sachs talk about this and you can tell he's just foaming at the [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2150.64s)]
*  mouth angry about it. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2156.64s)]
*  Just think about what a historic opportunity this was. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2158.0s)]
*  50 years of nuclear close calls and proxy warfare with the Soviet Union. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2160.8399999999997s)]
*  And we had this opportunity, the West, specifically the United States, to be gracious in victory [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2167.68s)]
*  and to show some respect to the Russian people who had just overthrown communism and were [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2174.24s)]
*  asking for our help. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2179.0s)]
*  Instead, we did the exact opposite. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2180.72s)]
*  We did the exact opposite. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2182.92s)]
*  Jeffrey Sachs has complained about this ever since, that once he got over there and started [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2185.68s)]
*  the privatization process going, and again, it's usually known as shock therapy. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2191.08s)]
*  It gives you an idea of how disruptive and traumatic the process is and why any country [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2196.04s)]
*  that's trying it needs some support if it's going to work, if it has any chance of working. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2200.28s)]
*  And so Sachs calls back to Washington, D.C. and says, all right, we're ready. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2206.42s)]
*  You know the drill. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2211.2200000000003s)]
*  It worked in Poland. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2212.2200000000003s)]
*  It'll work here. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2213.2200000000003s)]
*  We just need the IMF to run the same playbook and we'll have Russia back on its feet in [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2214.34s)]
*  no time. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2218.7000000000003s)]
*  But when he was in Poland, people were like, yeah, totally, let's do it. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2219.7000000000003s)]
*  When he was in Russia, he calls back and he's not getting the same response. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2225.98s)]
*  He just got resistance and refusal. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2229.88s)]
*  And he says that he couldn't understand why Washington was suddenly acting like this. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2232.26s)]
*  He was dealing with the same people he had dealt with when he was in Poland. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2236.42s)]
*  They knew how the process was supposed to work. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2240.8s)]
*  They knew that it was working in Poland. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2243.7400000000002s)]
*  But he says that over time, as he had more and more of these conversations and his other [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2247.78s)]
*  people kind of came to him on the down low and let him know what was really going on, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2251.7400000000002s)]
*  he began to understand that back in Washington, D.C., they did not want Russia back on its [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2256.6000000000004s)]
*  feet. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2261.54s)]
*  They wanted Russia to stay face down in the dirt so that we could pick her pockets and [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2263.66s)]
*  dance on her grave. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2269.06s)]
*  Sax resigned in disgust in 2004. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2270.26s)]
*  The 2004 Russia is just the beginning of its problems. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2272.94s)]
*  See, the way they decided to privatize the economy was very crude. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2277.86s)]
*  What they do is create paper vouchers. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2282.38s)]
*  I mean, just think about you have everything and all the big industries are owned by the [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2284.98s)]
*  government. Now you have to figure out, well, who gets what? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2288.1s)]
*  Right. So what they did is create a paper voucher. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2290.26s)]
*  And give one to each Russian citizen and each voucher represented your share [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2292.46s)]
*  of the Russian formerly state industries. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2298.3s)]
*  And you can do with it whatever you want. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2300.82s)]
*  The people had no idea what to do with them. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2304.14s)]
*  You know, they had no food. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2306.74s)]
*  These people couldn't buy medicine or meet any of their basic needs. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2308.42s)]
*  And it's like these vouchers pay dividends or something. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2311.9s)]
*  So for most people, their value at the time was entirely abstract. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2314.62s)]
*  And you just imagine you're in that desperate situation. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2318.58s)]
*  No food on your kids table. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2321.98s)]
*  And they come around and give you a piece of paper that says one share of Russian [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2323.46s)]
*  industry or whatever. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2326.86s)]
*  What can you do with it except sell it to somebody who has some money and who has [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2329.62s)]
*  money in a post-communist economy, except for gangsters running the black market [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2334.06s)]
*  and ex-KGB and military officers who have been selling off the Russian armory [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2339.22s)]
*  to the black market and people who have connections with the West. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2344.22s)]
*  And so Western financial institutions did pretty much the same thing they did in [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2349.22s)]
*  Germany. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2353.3799999999997s)]
*  They sent agents to go hook up with some unscrupulous locals and offered them US [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2354.62s)]
*  dollars in British pounds to go buy up everybody's vouchers for practically [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2360.2599999999998s)]

*  When you hear about the Russian oligarchs, this is how they got to be oligarchs. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2369.8199999999997s)]
*  By 1997, seven men owned 58 percent of the entire Russian economy. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2374.86s)]
*  And we're talking about gangsters and killers. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2385.7000000000003s)]
*  You might remember after Putin took over, he put the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2389.5s)]
*  on trial, the guy who ran Yukos Oil. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2394.26s)]
*  They had him in a cage in the courtroom. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2397.5s)]
*  It was quite a picture. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2399.1s)]
*  Well, the Western press made out like Khodorkovsky was just some political [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2402.02s)]
*  dissident, a victim of political persecution. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2405.26s)]
*  If that guy had been an American and done what he had done over there, over here, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2407.94s)]
*  he would have been lucky to avoid death row. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2413.14s)]
*  These gangsters were taking advantage to buy up the Russian economy and shipping [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2416.34s)]
*  the money that they made out of the country into foreign accounts as fast as [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2420.86s)]
*  Western banks could launder it for them. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2424.54s)]
*  Meanwhile, Russia was in a state of panic. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2427.34s)]
*  Meanwhile, Russian civil society and public health completely collapsed. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2430.38s)]
*  I mean, completely collapsed. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2435.94s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2437.1400000000003s)]
*  In the United States in recent years, we've had a lot of problems with deaths of [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2439.1000000000004s)]
*  despair, drug overdoses, things like that, unprecedented spikes in mortality from [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2444.1000000000004s)]
*  these things, as well as from COVID-19. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2448.38s)]
*  Drug overdose deaths are up 137 percent in the United States since 2000. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2451.5800000000004s)]
*  With all of those factors combined, all of these things that have been hitting us [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2456.54s)]
*  at once, average life expectancy for the worst impacted demographics in the United [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2460.2599999999998s)]
*  States has dropped by about a year and a half. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2465.54s)]
*  Average life expectancy. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2469.3s)]
*  The life expectancy of Russian men dropped from the high 60s in 1990 to the low to [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2472.14s)]
*  mid 50s by the middle of the decade. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2478.98s)]
*  And it's even worse than that sounds because when you actually get to the [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2481.7s)]
*  numbers, life expectancy for women was basically unchanged. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2485.46s)]
*  Life expectancy for young children and senior citizens was basically unchanged. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2490.66s)]
*  Virtually the entire drop, this massive drop in life expectancy was concentrated [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2495.86s)]
*  among Russian men just due to a massive spike in early deaths, deaths almost [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2502.34s)]
*  entirely due to suicide and violence and drug and alcohol poisoning. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2509.62s)]
*  You have any idea how many murders, suicides, drug overdoses and alcohol [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2516.22s)]
*  poisonings a country has to have for its life expectancy to drop 15 years? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2521.66s)]
*  I mean, it was just a catastrophe. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2528.62s)]
*  Life expectancy in countries that were hardest hit by the 1918 Spanish flu [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2530.58s)]
*  pandemic never dropped that much. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2535.34s)]
*  It was just a total full spectrum disaster. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2537.1s)]
*  And again, it's happening at the same time that Western financial institutions [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2540.7799999999997s)]
*  are picking the bones of the Russian economy clean with the help of local gangsters. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2544.98s)]
*  Nobody to this day really knows how much was looted, but at least hundreds of [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2550.46s)]
*  billions of dollars were siphoned out of the Russian economy into foreign bank [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2554.54s)]
*  accounts as regular Russian people were literally starving to death and dying [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2558.5s)]
*  from lack of basic necessities. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2563.22s)]

*  And the oligarchs who owned Russia's television and radio stations and newspapers [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2582.46s)]
*  did their part to make sure that he won. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2586.2200000000003s)]
*  Here's part of an article written by Mark Weisbrot. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2587.9s)]

*  To say this is long overdue would be an understatement. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2626.06s)]
*  The corruption is certainly mind numbing in scale and scope with some of the West [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2630.7400000000002s)]

*  representative at the IMF, at the center of the investigation. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2640.34s)]
*  But the tribute that the Russian mafia skims off the top is just one part of the [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2644.9s)]
*  looting of Russia. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2649.06s)]
*  The other part has been scripted by Washington and its most powerful financial [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2651.18s)]
*  institution, the International Monetary Fund. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2655.2599999999998s)]

*  They have used both to colonize Russia, turning a once developed economy into a [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2685.38s)]
*  third world country. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2690.22s)]
*  The results have been devastating. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2692.02s)]
*  Over the last eight years, the economy has shrunk by more than half. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2694.54s)]

*  Like a battered spouse who sees no alternative but to return to her abuser, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2733.5s)]
*  Russia comes back to the IMF for more credits. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2737.98s)]
*  But the hundreds of billions that have fled the country in the 1990s have canceled [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2741.3399999999997s)]

*  At the same time, Russia has accumulated more than 150 billion dollars in [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2751.2599999999998s)]
*  foreign debt, with the burden of debt service now reaching a crushing 29 percent [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2755.54s)]
*  of total export earnings. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2760.54s)]
*  At some point, any rational, non-corrupt political leader in Russia has to question [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2764.06s)]
*  whether the country's friendly relations with Washington are worth the price of [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2770.34s)]
*  continued impoverishment. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2774.86s)]
*  That time may be approaching as Russia elects first a parliament and then a [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2777.22s)]
*  president over the next 10 months. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2781.22s)]

*  loosen, the chains that bind Russia to its Western tormentors. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2787.14s)]
*  The American press will dismiss these demands as nationalist finger pointing and [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2792.14s)]
*  attribute Russia's demise to its failure to hew more closely to the IMF's [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2796.62s)]
*  prescriptions, and Washington will pour money into the Russian elections as it [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2800.66s)]
*  did in 1996 to support its friends. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2805.34s)]
*  But the Russians might well be better off cutting this toxic umbilical cord, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2808.14s)]
*  which could at least give them a fighting chance against the powerful domestic [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2812.74s)]
*  criminal class that our own government and private sectors have helped to [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2816.5s)]
*  create. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2821.02s)]
*  Now that article was written in 1999, about three months before Vladimir Putin [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2824.06s)]
*  pushed Boris Yeltsin out of office and took the helm of the Russian government. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2830.74s)]
*  At first, the West was cautiously optimistic about Putin. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2835.62s)]
*  He looked like a guy from within the system, and they expected him to keep the [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2842.42s)]
*  grift going as long as he got his cut. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2847.62s)]
*  But very quickly it became apparent that that was not going to happen. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2850.58s)]
*  Putin told the oligarchs, you know, you guys can stay rich, but you can't [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2854.8199999999997s)]

*  asserting its prerogatives again. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2889.14s)]
*  Well, many of the oligarchs, mostly ethnic Russians, accepted the deal. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2891.66s)]
*  And those are the oligarchs that are still in Russia today, now getting their [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2897.42s)]
*  yachts seized in European ports. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2901.8599999999997s)]
*  Many others didn't, and they took their hundreds of billions of dollars and [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2904.62s)]
*  fled to New York and London and Tel Aviv, where they have spent their money [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2908.7799999999997s)]
*  ever since lobbying our governments to maintain our belligerent stance toward [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2913.74s)]
*  Russia as long as Putin's in command. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2918.54s)]
*  Now let's circle back to the beginning, the Cold War's ending. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2920.66s)]
*  The Soviet government is trying to decide whether to step off and let its [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2927.66s)]
*  various parts break away or to do whatever it takes to preserve their country. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2932.3799999999997s)]
*  And in 1989, they agreed not to resist the reunification of Germany and its [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2937.06s)]
*  integration into NATO. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2942.8199999999997s)]
*  And so I take you back to that moment and I want you to just imagine the [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2945.66s)]
*  discussions that must have taken place in the Soviet government over this. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2949.82s)]
*  I'm talking about over the reunification of Germany and its entry into NATO. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2955.1400000000003s)]
*  Just imagine the behind the scenes discussions. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2959.1400000000003s)]
*  Germany, the country that had brought the apocalypse to the Soviet Union, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2961.6200000000003s)]
*  within living memory, there were guys in the Soviet government who had fought the [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2968.38s)]
*  Nazis in World War II. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2971.98s)]
*  So Germany was not only coming back together, but it would be joining what had [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2973.42s)]
*  always been an explicitly anti-Russian military alliance. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2979.7400000000002s)]
*  Today we see Germany and we're like, ah, the Germans. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2985.1400000000003s)]
*  And we might think any concern over them going back to militarism is a silly [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2988.42s)]
*  concern, but that wasn't how it was at the time. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2992.82s)]
*  The big reason we insisted on putting them in NATO is so that we could keep control [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2995.9s)]
*  of them in case they got wild again. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=2999.94s)]
*  And there was real concern over that. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3003.78s)]
*  Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister of the UK at the time, she was completely [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3005.78s)]
*  against German reunification and tried to stop it to the point that we essentially [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3009.26s)]
*  just went behind the UK's back and got the rest of NATO on board and then just [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3013.1400000000003s)]
*  dropped it on our desk and said, eh, sorry. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3017.58s)]
*  And so if Thatcher, Margaret Thatcher was that worried about the danger of German [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3021.1800000000003s)]
*  reunification, you can imagine how the Russians had reason to feel about it. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3025.54s)]
*  And especially again, since it would be joining an explicitly anti-Russian [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3030.34s)]
*  military alliance. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3034.14s)]
*  But they went along with it. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3037.14s)]
*  They didn't resist it. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3038.82s)]
*  They had a ton of troops, ton of military hardware in Germany. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3041.5s)]
*  That's where the bulk of their forces, where they could have put up a fight, but [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3045.38s)]
*  they didn't. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3048.94s)]
*  Well, primary reason for that is that the United States and other NATO countries [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3051.34s)]
*  promised them that if the Russians did not resist with Germany, that that would be [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3056.22s)]
*  it. That's as far as NATO would move to the east. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3061.3399999999997s)]
*  And for years, there was dispute over the precise wording or whether it was actually [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3065.18s)]
*  promised or maybe just implied and the Russians took it that way. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3069.8599999999997s)]
*  But today we know that not only the Russians, but our NATO allies understood it [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3073.8199999999997s)]
*  as a guarantee. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3079.46s)]
*  Scott Horton recently gave a fantastic speech going through the history of this [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3080.38s)]
*  post Cold War Cold War in which we have been engaged. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3085.7000000000003s)]
*  And he said this, quote, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3088.82s)]
*  This was, as Charles Krauthammer put it in Foreign Affairs in 1990, the U.S.'s [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3110.82s)]
*  unipolar moment, an opportunity to remake the world our way and keep it that way. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3115.98s)]
*  They called it leadership, hegemony, preeminence, predominance, or even full [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3122.82s)]
*  spectrum dominance. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3128.7000000000003s)]
*  Dick Cheney's Defense Department's post-Iraq War I defense planning guidance from [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3131.46s)]
*  1992 defined the doctrine for the new decade and into the new millennium. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3136.46s)]
*  The U.S. must remain the single dominant power on the planet and must maintain [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3141.98s)]
*  enough military power to prevent any possible strategic rivals such as Germany, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3147.42s)]
*  Japan, Russia or China from even considering an attempt to challenge U.S. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3152.34s)]
*  power. As those same neoconservatives wrote in their 1998 project for a new American [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3157.5s)]

*  doctrine. But there was a problem. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3172.14s)]
*  On February 9th, 1990, President George H.W. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3176.2599999999998s)]
*  Bush and his secretary of state, James Baker III, promised Soviet Premier Mikhail [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3180.46s)]
*  Gorbachev that if the Soviet Union would withdraw their troops and allow German [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3186.3399999999997s)]
*  reunification under America's NATO military alliance, they would not expand it, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3191.02s)]
*  as James Baker put it, one inch eastward beyond that. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3195.98s)]
*  West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, French President Francois Mitterrand and British [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3200.74s)]
*  Prime Minister's Margaret Thatcher and later John Major all made the same promise. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3206.5s)]
*  Of course, they have lied about it since, at various times claiming this pledge either [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3212.38s)]
*  never happened or doesn't count because it wasn't in writing. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3216.82s)]
*  But in 2019, the records were posted at George Washington University's National [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3220.94s)]
*  Security Archive. You can read the writing yourself. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3225.86s)]
*  Just last month, at the end of February 2022, an American researcher found in the [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3230.1s)]

*  Germany, on March 6th, 1991, in which German representative Jürgen Krobach says, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3245.86s)]
*  As reported by the German paper Der Spiegel, US representative Raymond Seitz said, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3264.2200000000003s)]
*  That we will not take advantage of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3275.86s)]
*  Well, of course, we reneged on that promise almost immediately. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3283.38s)]
*  Once the Soviet Union came apart and Russia was down on its knees, we start pushing NATO [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3288.02s)]
*  past the eastern border of Germany. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3294.6600000000003s)]
*  Now, US officials could lie to us about what was said. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3297.94s)]
*  You know, we don't know any better. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3302.86s)]

*  They were in the room. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3305.86s)]
*  They know what was said. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3307.3s)]

*  And so how are they supposed to interpret this? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3313.38s)]
*  We know how they did interpret it. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3317.1000000000004s)]
*  This is Vladimir Putin in a recent speech, quote, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3319.86s)]
*  That has come to us with their missiles. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3332.26s)]
*  They are already on our doorstep. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3335.1400000000003s)]
*  Not one inch to the east, they told us in the 90s. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3337.38s)]

*  Now, you and I might disagree with his framing here. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3353.42s)]
*  Fine. But we are not responsible for Russia's national security. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3357.82s)]
*  And so you ask yourself, why would we do this? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3363.0600000000004s)]
*  Right. Many of America's most experienced and influential foreign policy dons ask the [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3366.3s)]

*  degrade NATO's ability to carry out its primary mission and will involve U.S. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3501.6600000000003s)]
*  security guarantees to countries with serious border and national minority problems and [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3506.1s)]
*  unevenly developed systems of democratic government. Now I'm back to Scott. President [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3512.62s)]
*  Clinton had said that they would build and secure a new Europe, peaceful, democratic, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3518.5s)]
*  and undivided at last. But he wasn't uniting Europe. He was redividing it. Ambassador [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3523.74s)]
*  Matlock, this was the second-to-last U.S. ambassador to the USSR under Reagan, warned that if you [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3531.54s)]
*  exclude Russia from the expanded alliance, it would necessarily be perceived as being [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3538.7s)]
*  against them. Here, the Cold War had already been over for two years before the final end [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3543.82s)]
*  of the USSR and the USA was already on the path to restarting it again. George Kennan wrote in [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3549.02s)]
*  the New York Times in 1997, Expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3556.42s)]
*  the entire post-Cold War era. Such a decision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3564.42s)]
*  anti-Western, and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion, to have an adverse effect on [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3571.34s)]
*  the development of Russian democracy, to restore the atmosphere of the Cold War to East-West [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3577.06s)]
*  relations, and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3582.5s)]
*  Kennan complained to the Times' Thomas L. Friedman in 1998, I think NATO expansion is the beginning [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3588.5s)]
*  of a new Cold War. I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3597.1s)]
*  affect their policies. I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3603.02s)]
*  No one was threatening anybody else. The expansion would make the founding fathers of this country [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3610.5s)]
*  turn in their graves. We have signed up to protect a whole series of countries, even though we have [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3617.98s)]
*  neither the resources nor the intention to do so in any serious way. Don't people, this is still [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3624.34s)]
*  Kennan, don't people understand? Our differences in the Cold War were with the Soviet communist [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3631.38s)]
*  regime and now we are turning our backs on the very people who mounted the greatest bloodless [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3637.42s)]
*  revolution in history to remove that Soviet regime. Of course there is going to be a bad [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3643.14s)]
*  reaction from Russia and then the NATO expanders will say that we always told you that that's just [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3649.02s)]
*  how the Russians are, but this is just wrong. His prediction, our present. End quote. So again, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3655.86s)]
*  that's George Kennan, the famously soft on communism George Kennan, on the short list of [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3666.98s)]
*  the most distinguished American diplomats of the 20th century who personally authored the basis of [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3674.38s)]
*  our Cold War strategy, basically saying, yeah, of course Russia is going to take NATO expansion as [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3679.7s)]
*  a threat and of course it's going to increase tensions and provoke a bad reaction from them. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3685.94s)]
*  He even got the next part right when he says that once Russia does react negatively and take steps [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3690.58s)]
*  to push back, people point to those actions as post hoc justification for everything we did to [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3696.86s)]
*  contribute to the situation. One more passage from Scott. He just did a great job of putting [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3702.46s)]
*  all this stuff together and I would have been using it anyway so I might as well just give him [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3709.58s)]
*  credit for it and quote him. I hope everyone listens to his full talk which I'll put in the [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3714.5s)]
*  show notes. Quote, President Joe Biden claims that Russia's recent actions have nothing to do with [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3718.26s)]
*  NATO expansion, that this is merely a thin excuse invoked by Vladimir Putin's government. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3726.14s)]
*  Well, in 2016, Bill Clinton's former Secretary of Defense William Perry admitted to The Guardian [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3732.22s)]
*  that in the last few years, most of the blame can be pointed at the actions that Putin has taken. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3739.54s)]
*  And this is in 2016 again, so he's talking about what Russia was doing in Crimea and [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3745.3399999999997s)]
*  Ukraine after the coup d'état against Ukraine's elected government in 2014. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3751.26s)]
*  But in the early years, I have to say that the United States deserves much of the blame. Our [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3755.46s)]
*  first action that really set us off in a bad direction was when NATO started to expand, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3762.9s)]
*  bringing in Eastern European nations, some of them bordering Russia. Now Perry continues, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3768.26s)]
*  and again, remember this is the Secretary of Defense back in the 90s when NATO expansion [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3775.1s)]
*  was getting underway. This is not some pundit in the peanut gallery. Quote, at that time, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3780.3s)]
*  we were working closely with Russia and they were beginning to get used to the idea that NATO could [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3786.86s)]
*  be a friend rather than an enemy. But they were very uncomfortable about having NATO right up on [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3793.86s)]
*  their border and they made a strong appeal for us not to go ahead with that. And now listen to this, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3799.46s)]
*  again, this is still Secretary of Defense William Perry. It wasn't that we listened to their [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3805.5s)]
*  arguments and said, well, we don't agree with that argument. Basically, the people I was arguing with [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3812.38s)]
*  when I tried to put the Russian point of view out there, the response that I got was really, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3818.58s)]
*  who cares what they think? They're a third-rate power. And of course, that point of view got [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3823.54s)]
*  across to the Russians as well. That was when we started sliding down that path. Now back to Scott, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3830.94s)]
*  quote, Secretary Perry almost resigned over NATO expansion back then. In the interview, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3838.42s)]
*  he also blamed the US for provocative missile defense systems in Europe and the color-coded [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3844.94s)]
*  revolutions in Russia's near abroad for poisoning relations with Putin's Russia. In fact, he said, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3850.26s)]
*  Putin was sure the US was plotting to overthrow him too, something which Perry did not seem to [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3856.66s)]
*  think was too far-fetched himself. This is back to Perry. After he came to office, Putin came to [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3861.94s)]
*  believe that the United States had an active and robust program to overthrow his regime. And from [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3868.7s)]
*  that point on, a switch went on in Putin's mind that said, I can no longer work with the West. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3874.8199999999997s)]
*  And back to Scott. As the great Ted Galen carpenter of the Cato Institute and antiwar.com pointed out [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3880.9s)]
*  last week, Clinton's Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, conceded in her memoirs that Yeltsin and [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3887.1800000000003s)]
*  his countrymen were strongly opposed to NATO enlargement, seeing it as a strategy for exploiting [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3893.78s)]
*  their vulnerability and moving Europe's dividing line to the East, leaving them isolated. So then [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3899.5s)]
*  next, Scott talks about these diplomatic cables that were written by our ambassador to Russia in [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3907.5s)]
*  2008, back to Washington. And the ambassador at the time was a guy named William Burns. And that [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3914.3s)]
*  name might sound a little bit familiar because William Burns is now Joe Biden's CIA director. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3922.58s)]
*  And so anyway, in early 2008, Ambassador Burns meets with Putin, who tells him in plain language, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3928.02s)]
*  quote, No Russian leader could stand idly by in the face of steps toward NATO membership for [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3937.94s)]
*  Ukraine. That would be a hostile act toward Russia. As part of that same series of meetings, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3945.5s)]
*  which came just a few months before a big NATO conference in Bucharest, where the idea of bringing [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3953.82s)]
*  Ukraine and Georgia into NATO would be discussed. He also met with Russia's Foreign Minister, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3960.34s)]
*  Sergey Lavrov. And Scott picks it up from here, quote, In January of that year, Burns met with [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3965.94s)]
*  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and then wrote a memo for Secretary of State Condoleezza [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3973.1400000000003s)]
*  Rice back home entitled, Nyet means Nyet. Nyet means no in Russian. Julian Assange sacrificed [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3978.6s)]
*  his liberty to the darkest dungeons of the empire to bring us this information. In the memo, Burns, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3987.2s)]
*  again, this is the current CIA director today, under Joe Biden, wrote, quote, During his annual [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=3992.64s)]
*  review of Russia's foreign policy, January 22 and 23, Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed that Russia [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4001.84s)]
*  had to view continued eastward expansion of NATO, particularly to Ukraine and Georgia, as a potential [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4009.28s)]
*  military threat. While Russia might believe statements from the West that NATO was not [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4017.0s)]
*  directed against Russia, when one looked at recent military activities in NATO countries, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4022.6000000000004s)]
*  for example, establishment of US forward operating locations, etc., they had to be [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4027.84s)]
*  evaluated not by our stated intentions, but by their potential. Lavrov stresses that maintaining [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4034.08s)]
*  Russia's sphere of influence in the neighborhood was anachronistic and acknowledged that the US [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4041.2000000000003s)]
*  and Europe had legitimate interests in the region. But, he argued, while countries were [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4047.4s)]
*  free to make their own decisions about their security and which political military structures [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4053.92s)]
*  to join, they needed to keep in mind the impact on their neighbors. Ukraine and Georgia's NATO [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4058.84s)]
*  aspirations not only touch a raw nerve in Russia, they engender serious concerns about the consequences [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4066.52s)]
*  for stability in the region. Not only does Russia perceive encirclement and efforts to undermine [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4073.8s)]
*  influence in the region, but it also fears unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4080.16s)]
*  which would seriously affect Russian security interests. Experts tell us that Russia is [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4086.0s)]
*  particularly worried that the strong divisions in Ukraine over NATO membership with much of the [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4091.7999999999997s)]
*  ethnic Russian community against membership could lead to a major split involving violence or, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4098.84s)]
*  at worst, civil war. In that eventuality, Russia would have to decide whether to intervene, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4105.56s)]
*  a decision Russia does not want to have to face. End quote. That is Joe Biden's CIA director, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4113.84s)]
*  writing as the ambassador to Russia in January of 2008. And then what happened less than three [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4122.400000000001s)]
*  months later? Three months after that cable reached Washington, in April 2008, after the NATO [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4129.68s)]
*  conference in Bucharest, the Alliance released an official statement saying that Georgia and Ukraine [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4138.64s)]
*  will be put on a path to NATO membership. Now, NATO stands for North Atlantic Treaty Organization, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4143.92s)]
*  and Ukraine and Georgia, as far as I know, are not anywhere near the Atlantic. So why the move [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4152.64s)]
*  to bring those two in? Why not bring in Argentina or Ghana or Brazil? At least they're on the [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4160.360000000001s)]
*  Atlantic Ocean, but nobody's talking about that. And the reason should be obvious, because the [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4168.56s)]
*  primary purpose of NATO is as a weapon against Russia. Robert Gates, the respected secretary [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4173.360000000001s)]
*  of defense under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, wrote in his memoirs that trying to bring [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4180.84s)]
*  Ukraine and Georgia into NATO was truly overreaching. That was an especially monumental [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4187.8s)]
*  provocation. Now, you might ask yourself if George Kennan and Bob Gates and Jack Matlock and Paul [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4194.88s)]
*  Nitsa and William Perry and Bob McNamara and all of these major, major foreign policy establishment [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4205.44s)]
*  figures were so dead set against NATO expansion, who the hell was for it? And how did they win the [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4212.32s)]
*  debate? The journalist Richard Cummings explained in 1997 that it all started with a man named [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4219.719999999999s)]
*  Bruce Jackson, who, quote, had launched the US Committee on NATO Expansion, a non-governmental [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4227.759999999999s)]
*  pressure group in 1996. The objective of the committee was to push for membership in the NATO [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4234.56s)]
*  military alliance for former Soviet bloc countries, including Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4240.68s)]
*  Well, who's Bruce Jackson? Good question. Cummings goes on, quote, as the New York Times put it in a [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4246.84s)]
*  1997 article, at night, Bruce Jackson is president of the US Committee to Expand NATO, giving [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4256.580000000001s)]
*  intimate dinners for senators and foreign officials. By day, he is director of strategic planning for [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4264.28s)]
*  Lockheed Martin Corporation, the world's biggest weapons maker. That's how DC works. Many of the [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4271.36s)]

*  conservative think tanks, lobbying firms, law firms, and the defense industry. So strong is [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4284.16s)]
*  the bond between lobbyists, defense contractors, and the Pentagon that it is known in Washington [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4290.88s)]
*  as the Iron Triangle. And this triangle inevitably gets what it wants. Why? Because in the revolving [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4296.4400000000005s)]

*  Russia was starting to believe us when we said that NATO could be a potential friend rather than [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4508.2s)]
*  an enemy. In fact, did you know that the next year after Vladimir Putin took power in 2000, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4513.719999999999s)]

*  get into NATO because if Russia was in NATO, people might start asking what the hell NATO was for. In [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4539.84s)]
*  2004, we brought in seven more countries, including three that were right on Russia's border. And then [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4547.2s)]
*  we started installing weapons systems that were clearly arrayed against Russia in the territory [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4555.96s)]
*  of our new allies. We put strategic missile launchers in Romania and Poland, and when the [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4560.88s)]
*  Russians objected, we told them, I don't worry about it. They're only there to counter the [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4566.88s)]
*  Iranians. Bush really said that. Well, the Russians had always expressed concern about NATO expansion, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4571.16s)]
*  but by now they're getting pretty agitated about it. I already read you the quotes from our current [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4579.84s)]
*  CIA director, the ambassador to Russia at the time, where he warned people that the Russians [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4584.88s)]
*  were at the end of their rope and that NATO expansion specifically into Ukraine and Georgia [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4589.56s)]
*  was an absolute red line for them. And then, as I said, three months later, we announced we're [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4594.64s)]
*  putting Ukraine and Georgia on the fast track for NATO membership anyway. And we'd gotten used to [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4600.08s)]
*  the Russians crying about it, but never doing anything. Who cares what they think? They're a [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4605.56s)]
*  third rate power. The president of Georgia at the time of that NATO Bucharest declaration was a, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4610.92s)]
*  well, there's no other way to put it. He was a straight up State Department asset named Mikhail [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4618.24s)]
*  Sakashvili. And I mean that literally. He was educated in the United States on a State Department [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4624.92s)]
*  scholarship, and he came to power in Georgia in a US sponsored color revolution in 2003. He was [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4629.52s)]
*  our guy. What happened in 2003 was that American NGOs, non-governmental organizations, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4636.120000000001s)]
*  helped prompt new elections in Georgia by helping to fund and organize protests against [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4643.68s)]
*  the incumbent government. And during the election campaign, we send our guy, Sakashvili, over with [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4648.4800000000005s)]
*  an army of campaign advisors and pollsters and public relations people and a bunch of money to [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4654.88s)]
*  go over there and make sure that he wins the election. After he got run out of Georgia for [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4662.24s)]
*  corruption, surprise, a few years later, he turns up in Ukraine immediately after the 2014 coup, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4667.719999999999s)]
*  and we install him as the governor of Odessa. He's not even Ukrainian. The guy's an American [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4674.679999999999s)]
*  asset straight up. And after he had worn out his welcome in Georgia, we just put him to work [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4681.4s)]
*  somewhere else. Well, back in 2008, he's still president of Georgia after NATO declares that [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4686.8s)]
*  Georgia will be fast-tracked for NATO membership, at George W. Bush's insistence, by the way, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4693.4800000000005s)]
*  over the objections of a bunch of European members of the alliance. Sakashvili hears that [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4698.68s)]
*  declaration and reads between the lines and thinks that he's getting marching orders. You see, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4705.6s)]
*  one of the stipulations of the NATO treaty is that no new country can join if it's got disputed [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4710.400000000001s)]
*  borders. In other words, we can't bring a country already engaged in a conflict, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4716.0s)]
*  even a dormant conflict, into a mutual defense treaty because that would commit us to war the [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4721.6s)]
*  moment the ink was put to paper. Well, ever since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4726.2s)]
*  when all the countries were breaking away and declaring independence, Georgia declared its [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4731.16s)]
*  independence, but so did the Caucasus territory of South Ossetia, which Georgia considered to be [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4736.16s)]
*  part of Georgia. Well, there was some fighting in the early 90s between the South Ossetians and the [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4743.08s)]
*  Georgian government, but soon enough, the Russians and the Georgians come to an agreement. They both [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4749.48s)]
*  deploy peacekeepers to the region and agree to just preserve the status quo and keep things calm. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4754.16s)]
*  Georgia never gave up its claim to South Ossetia, though, and so Sakashvili knew that he was going [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4759.0s)]
*  to have to clear up this territorial dispute before his country could join NATO. And so when [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4765.96s)]
*  NATO declared its intention to bring Georgia in while this dispute was still ongoing, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4771.58s)]
*  Sakashvili took it as a message. And maybe it was more than an implied message. Who knows what was [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4775.74s)]
*  being said to him behind the scenes? He took it as a message that he should take action and go [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4780.98s)]
*  retake South Ossetia. And so he unilaterally pulls out of the agreement that Georgia had made with [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4785.7s)]
*  the Russians, withdraws the Georgian peacekeepers, and attacks South Ossetia. The Russians responded [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4791.0199999999995s)]
*  with extreme force and Georgia got its ass handed to it. I don't know how many of you remember when [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4800.34s)]
*  this was going on. It was right after the Olympics in 2008, but it was really remarkable how similarly [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4807.82s)]
*  Sakashvili was being treated by the media and by US politicians to how they're treating Ukraine's [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4815.9800000000005s)]
*  president Zelensky right now. Very, very similar. They portrayed him as this plucky comic book hero [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4821.78s)]
*  leading his people against the evil empire. They were putting out pleas from him on all the US [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4829.14s)]
*  networks calling for US involvement in the war. Just down the line, the same thing. It was very [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4836.42s)]
*  obvious at the time and even more so in retrospect that the United States did not expect the Russians [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4843.1s)]
*  to do anything about this because that's what we got used to. Again, the Russians might not like it, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4848.860000000001s)]
*  but they're not going to dare get in our way. Are you kidding? The response of many US leaders [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4854.58s)]
*  when they did get in our way was borderline freaking insane. You had John McCain calling [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4862.26s)]
*  for Georgia to be brought into NATO immediately, even though it was illegal since Georgia was [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4867.1s)]
*  currently at war and even though doing so would be the same thing as a declaration of war against [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4872.62s)]
*  Russia over a regional conflict that Georgia had unquestionably started. There were other senators [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4877.74s)]
*  calling for nuclear weapons to be deployed to Georgia. Dick Cheney wanted to fire on and [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4884.98s)]
*  collapse the big tunnel where the Russian armor columns were coming through. And for what? How [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4891.46s)]
*  does adding Georgia to NATO increase NATO's capabilities or improve anybody's security? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4898.34s)]
*  What was Georgia? And no offense to Georgians, man, but realistically, what were they bringing [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4904.46s)]
*  to the table? It's this tiny, poor country in a volatile part of the world. What would we be [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4912.5s)]
*  getting out of it other than problems? I think the obvious answer is we would be getting a forward [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4918.54s)]
*  operating base for our long war against Russia. What else is it for? Like I said, defense contractors [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4924.7s)]
*  profits are a big part of the calculation because a new NATO country needs that whole [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4932.74s)]
*  new arsenal of NATO compliant weaponry. But if it was just that, then they would bring in Argentina [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4937.9s)]
*  and Ghana and Brazil. I'm sure Lockheed would probably love that. NATO expansion has been used [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4945.0199999999995s)]
*  for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to hem in and to threaten Russia. That is just the [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4952.62s)]
*  fact of the matter. Our relations with the Russians have been on a downhill trajectory ever [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4960.26s)]
*  since 2008. We were distracted by the war on terror for a while, but other than that, if you look at [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4967.18s)]
*  it, most of the aggressive actions we have taken around the world over the last 15 or 20 years have [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4974.58s)]
*  all been directed against Russia and her allies. I mentioned that we sponsored the Rose Revolution [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4979.06s)]
*  in Georgia in 2003 to install a State Department sock puppet as president. Just 10 months after [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4985.74s)]
*  that, we sent the same ambassador who oversaw the Georgian Revolution to be the ambassador to [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4992.34s)]
*  Russia's ally Belarus, and surprise, surprise, there's an attempted color revolution against [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=4996.78s)]
*  that regime. In 2004, we sponsored the Orange Revolution in Ukraine. While that one was going [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5001.58s)]
*  on, the UK paper The Guardian did a piece on our role in the American role in what was unfolding, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5009.34s)]

*  And it described a strategy that reads very much like the one we have been employing against Russia [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5581.02s)]
*  for the stated purpose of, quote, unbalancing and destabilizing Russia. And just keep in mind [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5587.34s)]
*  what happened to Russia the last time the country was unbalanced and destabilized in the 1990s. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5595.5s)]
*  This paper says several times that Russia is paranoid about our intentions toward her and her [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5600.3s)]
*  allies. And it advises US policymakers to take advantage of that paranoia by placing offensive [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5608.38s)]
*  weapons in countries surrounding Russia, specifically to increase Russia's security [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5614.22s)]
*  anxiety. Like that's what it says. It calls for placing tactical nuclear weapons in countries all [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5619.9800000000005s)]
*  around Russia, says we ought to develop new long range bombers and other strike capabilities to, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5626.38s)]
*  quote, exploit Moscow's demonstrated fear of US air power capabilities and doctrines, which will [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5631.9800000000005s)]
*  incentivize Moscow to devote ever greater resources to defend against these threats. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5639.1s)]
*  I mean, just think about what they're saying here. Russia's already afraid of us. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5646.62s)]
*  So we should be more aggressive and more threatening toward them because that'll [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5650.9400000000005s)]
*  freak them out even more. And then that'll force them to start an arms race that they [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5655.02s)]
*  can't possibly win. It even says we need to expand our nuclear missile submarine fleet, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5659.18s)]
*  specifically to force Russia to spend more to defend against possible nuclear attack. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5665.42s)]

*  deployment to Europe. It acknowledges that that would for sure provoke a Russian response, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5688.22s)]
*  but it says that's actually a good thing too because any Russian response is going to cost [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5695.42s)]
*  them money and resources that they don't really have. There's a ton more in the paper. There's a [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5699.42s)]
*  whole section on overthrowing the regimes of Russia's allies. It suggests using propaganda [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5705.42s)]

*  credibility. That might sound familiar. And then it says that we should do what we can to drag out [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5716.14s)]
*  the conflict in Ukraine as long as possible. And again, this was a few years ago after the coup in [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5723.9800000000005s)]

*  in just a way that will gradually build up Ukraine's capabilities, but without actually [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5741.9s)]
*  giving Russia an excuse to intervene. So oopsie. I guess we miscalculated that one a little bit. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5747.66s)]
*  The paper is really worth reading in its entirety. I'll put it in the show notes. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5755.66s)]

*  came at a time when Putin had actually stepped down from the presidency and Dmitry Medvedev was [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5957.259999999999s)]
*  in office. And people will say, sure, well, you know, Putin still had one hand on the wheel, [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5963.259999999999s)]
*  though. And that's true. But it's not insignificant when the guy who is something like a dictator [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5968.54s)]
*  steps down and lets another guy step up. That's a big deal. You know, dictators keep power by [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5975.98s)]
*  making their reign look inevitable, identifying their own interests with those of the country so [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5982.94s)]
*  that people imagine that if we don't have that guy, then we're going back to the chaos that we had [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5988.7s)]
*  before he got here. But stepping down and letting someone else step up, even if he's supposed to be [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=5994.22s)]
*  a figurehead, it opens up the idea in the public mind and in the minds of other elites as well, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6000.7s)]
*  that there are actually alternatives to that one guy being in charge. But Medvedev was completely [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6007.98s)]
*  humiliated and totally discredited after being tricked by us in Libya. And so that was the end [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6014.86s)]
*  of that experiment. Putin took back the presidency with broad public support. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6020.54s)]
*  And it's very interesting when you look at US foreign policy in places other than the [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6025.26s)]
*  Russian borderlands and, of course, the war on terror. You know, what are the countries [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6031.02s)]

*  that we haven't tried to overthrow in recent years? I guess China, but we'd probably love [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6051.820000000001s)]

*  Many of the speakers at the meeting from other countries touched on very different themes, [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6201.1s)]
*  but the Russian and Belarusian military speakers provided a consistent and carefully orchestrated [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6206.22s)]

*  U.S. and the West as deliberately destabilizing other nations for their own ends. They described [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6217.18s)]

*  radically different reading of modern history, of U.S. and European strategy, their use of force, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6271.66s)]
*  and U.S. and European goals and actions from any issued in the West and in Russian prior literature. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6277.34s)]
*  Western experts can argue the degree to which this represents Russian anger over the West's [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6285.74s)]
*  reaction to the events in Ukraine, Russian efforts at persuading developing nations and Asia to back [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6291.18s)]
*  Russia in a reassertion of its strategic role in the world, propaganda to cloak the character of [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6297.5s)]
*  Russian actions in Ukraine and the near abroad, an effort to justify Russian action in Syria, [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6302.78s)]
*  or a very real Russian concern over U.S. and European actions that have destabilized key [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6308.7s)]

*  leaders and strategists are saying. These are not Russian views the U.S. and Europe can afford [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6328.62s)]

*  generally hawkish major U.S. defense think tank. I'll repeat the passage from Bill Clinton's [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6342.94s)]

*  said, well, we don't agree with that argument. Basically, the people I was arguing with when I [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6354.9400000000005s)]
*  tried to put the Russian point of view out there, the response that I got was really, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6360.38s)]
*  who cares what they think? They're a third rate power. And of course, that point of view got to [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6365.740000000001s)]
*  the cross to the Russians as well, end quote. Okay, so I don't want to belabor the point about [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6371.82s)]

*  back and forth on Twitter with Antonio Garcia Marquez, who I like in general, after he kept [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6388.46s)]

*  He's not the only one. I don't want to pick on him. Other people sometimes respond by posting [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6401.18s)]
*  pictures of the thousands and thousands of people out protesting during these revolutions. And they [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6406.22s)]
*  say something like, oh, okay, so I suppose all these people are out risking their lives just because [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6410.62s)]
*  they're being paid by the CIA, huh? I don't know if these arguments are just disingenuous or [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6417.18s)]
*  uninformed, but it's one of those two, maybe both. The fact is nobody, nobody with any idea [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6423.82s)]
*  of what they're talking about denies that the U.S. agencies and NGOs have been the driving force [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6431.74s)]
*  behind the color revolutions over the last 20 years. That is not something that is in dispute. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6438.219999999999s)]
*  The people in those countries don't deny it. And American officials never denied it because they [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6443.5s)]

*  conducted its survey of the public opinion of Ukrainians regarding its assessment of the [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6540.86s)]
*  current situation in Ukraine from December 23rd to December 27th. The information was collected [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6546.0599999999995s)]
*  through personal interviews in 24 regions of Ukraine, Crimea, Kiev, and Sevastopol. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6551.74s)]
*  The possible margin for error is 2.2%, end quote. And so the idea that the revolution was just, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6558.139999999999s)]
*  it's just a grassroots movement that involved all the people of Ukraine against the evil regime of [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6565.58s)]
*  Viktor Yanukovych, it's just not true. It's just not true. Half the country opposed the whole thing. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6571.66s)]
*  Pedro Gonzalez did some yeoman's work recently on how this whole process worked in Ukraine. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6578.46s)]
*  Did you know, for example, that Ukraine donated more money to the Clinton Foundation between 1999 [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6587.02s)]
*  and 2014 than any other country in the world? Did you know that Ukraine has spent more money [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6592.86s)]
*  lobbying Washington politicians in the last few years than any country ever has in the last few [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6599.5s)]
*  years? That's from the journalist Ben Simmons, who's an expert specifically on foreign lobbying [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6606.78s)]
*  in Washington. Now look, I know it's legal to bribe our politicians by hiring their children [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6611.9s)]
*  to no show jobs for a million dollars a year, or paying half a million dollars for their kids' art [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6620.38s)]
*  or something, but Ukraine is a very poor country. And yet, they're bribing with more money than any [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6626.3s)]
*  other country in the world. It's not like that proves anything by itself, but that gravy train [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6633.0199999999995s)]
*  would be cut off if Putin got his way in Ukraine. And those same politicians receiving the bribes [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6637.099999999999s)]
*  are telling us that we have to do absolutely everything to prevent that. Everything, even if [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6643.0199999999995s)]
*  it means the destruction of Ukraine's major cities and years of deadly insurgent warfare. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6647.9s)]
*  I'm just talking here, but is it just not relevant? Just not even worth paying attention to? [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6653.9s)]
*  Is it just not relevant? Just not even worth bringing up the fact that the country we are [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6659.98s)]
*  supposed to be ready to sacrifice everything to defend just happens to be the same country [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6664.94s)]
*  that's been bribing our leaders more than any other country in recent years? [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6670.86s)]
*  This is from Pedro's recent article on Substack, it's a great article, titled, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6676.62s)]
*  How the West Sowed the Seeds of War in Ukraine. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6681.98s)]
*  Quote, by Obama's second term, the engines of regime change in Ukraine had already been set [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6684.78s)]
*  in motion at the State Department during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. Indeed, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6690.7s)]
*  there were signs of trouble for Ukraine's President Yanukovych as soon as he was elected in 2010, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6695.9s)]
*  when the managers of the U.S. government-funded National Endowment for Democracy took notice of [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6700.94s)]
*  him. According to U.S. international relations scholar John Mearsheimer, the NED helped pump [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6705.66s)]
*  more than $5 billion into Ukraine between 1991 and 2013 to promote civil society, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6712.54s)]
*  but its real function is as a vehicle for regime change. Quote, a lot of what we do today [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6719.82s)]
*  was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA, explained NED co-founder Alan Weinstein. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6726.14s)]
*  Mearsheimer noted that after Yanukovych won Ukraine's presidential election in 2010, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6733.74s)]
*  the NED decided he was undermining its goals, and so it stepped up its efforts to support the [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6739.34s)]
*  opposition. Carl Gershman, who served as the NED's president from its founding in 1984 until 2021, [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6744.78s)]
*  called Ukraine the biggest prize in 2013, the year that the seeds of regime change sown by [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6752.94s)]
*  the West would begin to flower. End quote. Now, if I had more time, I would read the whole damn [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6759.34s)]
*  thing to you because there's a ton of important information that Pedro put in there. He also did [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6765.98s)]
*  a great article in Human Events recently, but I got to get you guys out of here at some point. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6770.299999999999s)]
*  I do encourage everybody to go read the full article on Pedro Gonzalez's substack. It's called [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6777.66s)]
*  Contra. I think most of it's behind a paywall, but if you got five bucks, it's worth the read. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6782.459999999999s)]
*  It really is. It's very informative. You can just sign up and cancel after you're done reading it [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6788.139999999999s)]
*  if you want. I don't care, but it's worth checking out. So let's talk about the revolution itself in [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6791.98s)]
*  2014. Focus on Ukraine. Leading up to the Maidan revolution in late 2013, Viktor Yanukovych, [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6798.62s)]
*  the country's president at the time, had been in talks with the European Union about a bailout for [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6806.7s)]
*  Ukraine's struggling economy. The talks were at a standstill primarily for two reasons. The first [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6811.66s)]
*  is that the EU was demanding really extreme austerity measures in a country that was already [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6819.74s)]
*  very poor, and Yanukovych didn't really feel like he had the political room to accept [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6826.22s)]
*  those kind of measures. They're talking about big salary and pension cuts, huge hikes and utility [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6831.74s)]
*  rates, things like that. Other measures that would hit the Ukrainian public directly and [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6836.46s)]
*  harden. Yanukovych just didn't feel like he had the political room to do that. The EU was also [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6842.7s)]
*  demanding special trade privileges, and this is what brings Russia into the discussion. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6847.58s)]
*  See, Russia and Ukraine, going back a long time, have had special trade arrangements, [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6853.42s)]
*  something like we have with Canada and Mexico under NAFTA, or USMCA rather. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6858.46s)]
*  Pretty much open borders as far as trade between Russia and Ukraine for a whole range of goods [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6863.74s)]
*  and commodities. And so Russia's concern was that any privileged trade agreement between the EU [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6868.46s)]
*  and Ukraine would mean that products from the European Union would be able to go around the [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6874.86s)]
*  EU's trade agreements with Russia by using Ukraine as a backdoor to flood the Russian market. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6879.82s)]
*  Very reasonable concern. This is something that we had going on in the United States for years [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6885.259999999999s)]
*  until NAFTA was reformed into the USMCA. China basically shut down our domestic steel production [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6890.62s)]
*  by flooding the US market with cheap subsidized Chinese steel, and they were selling it [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6898.78s)]
*  through Canada. They couldn't have done it directly. They were selling it through [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6904.62s)]
*  Canada to take advantage of the privileges that we had given our neighbor to the North. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6908.0599999999995s)]
*  And so Putin tells Yanukovych, who up to this point, don't believe the hype about him being [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6913.42s)]
*  a Russian puppet. That is nonsense, and nobody thought that back in 2010, 2011, 2012 or 13. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6919.18s)]
*  Nobody called him Putin's puppet until a few months before the coup happened. He was a guy who [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6925.18s)]
*  did what most Ukrainian leaders had done, which is try to play both sides. Stay neutral, [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6933.26s)]
*  get what you can out of Russia, get what you can out of Europe and the United States, [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6939.1s)]
*  play it in the middle. That's how everybody perceived him, and that's why we were actually [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6943.74s)]
*  cool with him when he came to power in 2010. And so Putin tells Yanukovych, look man, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6948.3s)]
*  you can do what you want, but Russia's got to protect Russian markets. So if you make this [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6953.74s)]
*  deal with the EU, then our whole thing, our whole special trade arrangement, that's over with. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6958.78s)]
*  Well, Ukraine's economy was very deeply tied into the Russian economy, much more than the EU. And so [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6966.46s)]
*  the effects of breaking that link would do more damage to the Ukrainian economy than any deal [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6971.42s)]
*  with the EU was going to repair, at least in the short and intermediate term. And so Yanukovych [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6977.42s)]
*  turns to Russia and accepts a bailout deal from them instead. And then just now he's Putin's, [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6983.26s)]
*  he's a Putin puppet. And a few months later, the Maidan Revolution breaks out with all the [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6989.900000000001s)]
*  characteristics. I mean, right down the line, all the characteristics of every other color [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6993.9800000000005s)]
*  revolution we've run. As soon as the protests start in Kiev, US officials start flying in, [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=6998.62s)]
*  flying into Ukraine to encourage the people on the streets to keep pushing. You have Victoria [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7007.1s)]
*  Nuland, who was Obama's Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7011.9s)]
*  She flies in to show her support and hand out cookies and donuts to the protesters. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7017.5s)]
*  As soon as they get going, three brand new television stations pop up, funded and staffed [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7022.94s)]
*  by Western NGOs to manage the propaganda war. John McCain and other US senators fly in to be [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7028.62s)]
*  pictured shaking hands with literal leaders of Ukraine's neo-Nazi and ultra-nationalist parties. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7035.98s)]
*  And to let the protesters know that America's got their backs while at the same time admitting [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7041.98s)]
*  that what they were trying to do would be devastating to Russia's position, McCain said, [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7047.0199999999995s)]
*  quote, there's no doubt that Ukraine is of vital importance to Putin. I think it was Henry Kissinger, [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7051.099999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure, said that Russia, without Ukraine, it's an Eastern power. With Ukraine, it's a [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7057.259999999999s)]
*  Western power. This is the beginning of Russia, right here in Kiev, end quote. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7062.94s)]
*  It sounds like he agrees with Vladimir Putin there. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7069.18s)]
*  Well, it's the middle of winter in Ukraine. This whole thing kicks off in November, December, [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7073.18s)]
*  2013. Dead of winter in Ukraine, it's not a very comfortable environment. And so when the initial [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7076.860000000001s)]
*  wave of protests didn't result in an immediate change of government, fewer and fewer people [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7085.900000000001s)]
*  started to show up. And it looked for a minute like the protests might fizzle out. And so people came [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7090.860000000001s)]
*  along and turned the thing into a full-fledged carnival, putting on, I mean, big production [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7097.18s)]
*  concerts, providing free food and drinks, blankets, space heaters for months, anything they needed to [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7103.5s)]
*  keep people coming back. This went on for like four months. And who do you think was paying for that? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7110.38s)]
*  I'll give you a hint. They speak English. In February 2014, protests been going on for a [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7115.900000000001s)]
*  few months now. A phone call is leaked between Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7123.58s)]
*  and our ambassador to Ukraine, Jeffrey Pyatt. And they are just straight up deciding who is going [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7129.74s)]
*  to be in which positions in Ukraine's new government, which is very interesting since [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7136.54s)]
*  the phone call was leaked two weeks before the coup even happened. And so just think about what [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7141.18s)]
*  I just said. We literally got caught planning the coup. I mean, literally caught on tape [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7146.38s)]
*  deciding who gets to be in which positions in the new government. And we just went through with it [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7152.78s)]
*  anyway. And that might sound kind of crazy to do, but why not? You know, just pretend like it never [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7158.38s)]
*  happened and call anybody who brings it up a Putin apologists and people rally to your side. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7163.66s)]
*  Well, a few weeks later, extremist neo-Nazi groups like Right Sector and Svoboda are arriving in [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7168.94s)]
*  force in Kiev with the intention of pushing the confrontation to a conclusion. It's been going on [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7179.179999999999s)]
*  long enough. You've heard a lot about these groups in recent weeks. Many people have tried [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7184.86s)]
*  to downplay their significance in Ukraine. And of course, it's true that they only constitute a small [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7191.74s)]
*  overall portion of the population. But you have to ask what their role in these events and in the [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7198.78s)]
*  regime is. Because there's no question that they played the decisive role in sparking and then [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7205.58s)]
*  consummating the coup in 2014. Were they the majority of protesters? No, of course not. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7212.46s)]
*  But they're the ones who got the coup going and made that happen. Now, this was not even denied in [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7220.0599999999995s)]
*  mainstream Western sources until the Russians started making an issue out of it more recently. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7225.82s)]
*  There's a half hour documentary that the PBS series Frontline did back in 2014 called The [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7231.179999999999s)]
*  Battle for Ukraine. And I highly recommend everybody watch it. It's pretty balanced. It's [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7237.42s)]
*  not real thorough. It's only a half hour, but it is on YouTube. Look up PBS Frontline, The Battle [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7241.82s)]
*  for Ukraine. It's good. The writer Lev Galenkin wrote this in The Nation magazine in 2016, [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7246.299999999999s)]
*  quote, Ukraine had an established far right movement long before the Maidan upheavals of [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7254.94s)]
*  late 2013, early 2014. In 2010, Ukraine's then president Viktor Yushchenko drew widespread [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7261.099999999999s)]
*  condemnation abroad by honoring Stepan Bandera, a Nazi collaborator and leader of an underground [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7268.38s)]
*  army responsible for slaughtering hundreds of thousands of Jews and Poles during World War II. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7274.62s)]
*  Pre-Maidan Ukraine was home to the Social National Assembly, a white supremacist organization headed [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7281.02s)]
*  by Andriy Balecki, who's written that his group's mission is to, quote, lead the white races of the [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7287.1s)]
*  world in a final crusade for their survival. It also had the Svoboda Party led by Ole Tiana-Bach, [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7293.26s)]
*  a parliamentary deputy. That's what they call a member of parliament there. A parliamentary [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7299.900000000001s)]
*  deputy whose 2004 request for an investigation of the Muscovite Jewish mafia controlling Kiev [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7305.26s)]
*  caused international headlines. Tiana-Bach is one of the guys John McCain and Senator Chris [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7312.3s)]
*  Murphy were pictured chumming it up with during their visit, by the way. In 2012, [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7318.06s)]
*  fellow Svoboda politician called Ukrainian-born actress Mila Kunis a dirty Jewess. All that these [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7323.66s)]
*  groups needed was an opportunity to come out of the shadows, and Maidan gave them that chance. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7331.34s)]
*  Initially, the disparate neo-Nazi factions remained on Maidan's periphery. But as the [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7337.42s)]
*  protests grew violent in late 2013, which led to Yanukovych's overthrow, civil war, Crimea, etc., [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7342.78s)]
*  the far right played a crucial role, providing muscle to protesters who were largely unequipped [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7351.1s)]
*  to do their own fighting, as the New Yorker described it. Indeed, the instrumental role of [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7357.18s)]
*  far-right groups was acknowledged by journalists and analysts in publications as diverse as [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7362.780000000001s)]
*  The Guardian, the BBC, Reuters, and the National Interest. Even Hannah Thoburn, [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7367.58s)]
*  a commentator who's authored numerous articles in support of Maidan, has pointed out the crucial [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7374.14s)]
*  role played by these groups. And now again, people will say sure, there were extremists in the mix, [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7378.860000000001s)]
*  but there are tens of thousands of people out there protesting. I already mentioned the [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7385.9s)]
*  extravagant lengths we went to to keep those people around through the cold winter, but let's [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7390.86s)]
*  just take that point at face value. The role of these extremist groups in these protests, [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7396.0599999999995s)]
*  it's similar to the role that like hardcore black bloc antifa activists play when American protests [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7403.099999999999s)]
*  turn into riots. There are thousands and thousands of people who are there to peacefully protest, [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7409.26s)]
*  and Antifa's job is to turn the peaceful protest into a riot. That's their job. That's why when [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7416.46s)]
*  black bloc shows up, the peaceful protest turns into a riot every time. We've seen the operation [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7422.38s)]
*  a hundred times. They show up on a block. They're the ones who throw the first bricks, do the first [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7429.58s)]
*  windows. They're the first ones that go through the broken window and kind of lead the looting. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7435.42s)]
*  And once the crowd starts following and it becomes a self-fulfilling thing and the police move in, [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7441.18s)]
*  they move on to the next block. They do the same thing or they start fires or they're the ones that [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7446.9400000000005s)]
*  provoke the cops into taking action that of course inevitably harm some of the peaceful protesters. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7452.3s)]
*  I'm not speculating about this. I mean, these tactics are well-known. They've been written [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7458.22s)]
*  about by their own side. Well, in Ukraine, the extremists are not drug-addicted children of [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7462.94s)]
*  wealthy parents putting on black masks and setting fires for the thrill of it. In Ukraine, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7471.419999999999s)]
*  you had the groups I mentioned a moment ago like the infamous Right Sector, which is a political [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7478.139999999999s)]
*  extremist organization as well as an organized crime syndicate. In 2015, a group of 20 or more [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7483.419999999999s)]
*  Right Sector soldiers rolled into the western Ukrainian town of Mukachevo where supposedly [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7490.78s)]
*  their illegal cigarette smuggling business was being infringed upon. They just started shooting [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7496.139999999999s)]
*  at civilians and local Ukrainian police. These guys were armed with rifles and grenade launchers. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7500.54s)]
*  Their trucks had mounted machine guns on them. The leader of Right Sector, Dmitry Yarosh, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7506.219999999999s)]
*  served in parliament in Ukraine for five years after the coup in 2014. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7512.62s)]
*  It was the presence of these groups that were ready to provoke and engage in very serious [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7517.26s)]
*  violence that really set the Ukrainian color revolution apart from the ones in the past. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7524.54s)]
*  A few days after that phone call between Victoria Nuland and Jeffrey Piot, [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7531.58s)]
*  choosing the post-coup Ukrainian government was leaked, an incident occurred that turned the [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7536.14s)]
*  protests into the coup d'etat that it became. On February 20th, 2014, again this is about four [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7541.26s)]
*  months into the protests, protesters begin to march on the parliament. These protesters are [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7550.38s)]
*  tooled up. They got shields. They got helmets. They're coming to do battle. The police set up [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7559.1s)]
*  barricades to prevent them from storming the building. The protesters set those barricades [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7565.26s)]
*  on fire and they pelted the police with stones and bottles and Molotov cocktails. There's video [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7570.7s)]
*  of Ukrainian police officers just on fire. I don't mean like your glove or your arm, just [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7576.860000000001s)]
*  you're on fire. A bunch of videos like that. The police respond with tear gas and rubber bullets. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7582.780000000001s)]
*  Then at some point, suddenly live rounds are being fired in all directions and when the smoke clears, [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7590.46s)]
*  a lot of people are on the ground dead. Immediately, without presenting any evidence for it to this day, [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7595.9s)]
*  the US government and the Western press announced that the shooting had come from the Ukrainian [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7604.46s)]
*  police at the specific order of Viktor Yanukovych. I don't know how they knew that. They even said [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7610.38s)]
*  likely with encouragement from Vladimir Putin. Again, I don't know how they would have known [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7616.06s)]
*  that. From that very day, everybody involved in the pre-Maidan Ukrainian government, from Yanukovych [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7620.54s)]
*  on down to the police who were there on scene, have insisted that the shooting originated from [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7628.3s)]
*  windows of buildings that were controlled by the protesters and that the bullets were aimed at both [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7633.26s)]
*  the police and the protesters at the same time in order to create that conflict and get the [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7639.580000000001s)]
*  shooting going and bring the protest to a head. If that sounds crazy to you, first of all, that [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7645.42s)]
*  kind of thing has happened before in other countries. Second of all, you got to know that [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7651.9s)]
*  these extremist groups are known for sure to have done similarly barbaric things many times. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7656.06s)]
*  After the Maidan protest turned into a coup, some anti-Maidan protesters in the city of Odessa [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7662.9400000000005s)]
*  occupied that city's main government building and a group of right sector thugs went to Odessa and [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7668.46s)]
*  besieged the building, blocked the exit, set the place on fire and burned 39 people to death. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7674.86s)]
*  In the city of Mariupol in 2014, a bunch of right sector guys alongside soldiers under the command [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7681.66s)]
*  of the post-coup Ukrainian government rolled into Mariupol with heavy weapons and armored [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7687.82s)]
*  vehicles to retake an occupied police station and just started shooting at anyone they saw. They [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7692.94s)]
*  massacred like 22 people. This is who these people are. It is not beyond them. So kicking off a [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7697.58s)]
*  revolution shooting into the crowd and at police, it is not beyond them. If you really want to dig [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7704.46s)]
*  into this, look up a paper written by a professor at the University of Ottawa named Ivan Kachanovsky. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7711.1s)]
*  The paper is available online. It's called The Sniper's Massacre on the Maidan and it is 79 [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7720.22s)]
*  pages long and it presents a very thorough forensic investigation that I can't summarize here, [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7725.9800000000005s)]
*  but this passage from the abstract will give you some idea. Quote, the paper analyzes a large [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7731.82s)]
*  amount of evidence from different publicly available sources concerning this massacre. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7737.66s)]
*  Qualitative content analysis includes the following data. About 1,500 videos and recordings. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7742.62s)]
*  There were surveillance cameras everywhere and there were people with cell phones and video [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7749.099999999999s)]
*  recorders and everything all over the place. So there's tons of material from right there [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7753.0199999999995s)]
*  where the shootings were going on. Qualitative content analysis includes the following data. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7756.94s)]
*  About 1,500 videos and recordings of live internet and TV broadcasts in mass media [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7762.379999999999s)]
*  and social media in different countries, some 150 gigabytes. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7768.46s)]
*  News reports and social media posts by more than 100 journalists covering the massacre from Kiev. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7772.62s)]
*  Some 5,000 photos and nearly 30 gigabytes of publicly available radio intercepts [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7779.339999999999s)]
*  of snipers and commanders from the special alpha unit of the Security Service of Ukraine [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7784.54s)]
*  and internal troops and Maidan massacre trial recordings. This study also employs field [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7789.1s)]
*  research on the site of the massacre. Eyewitness reports by both Maidan protesters and government [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7795.26s)]
*  special units and commanders. Statements by both former and current government officials. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7801.18s)]
*  Estimates of approximate ballistic trajectories, bullets and weapons used, and types of wounds [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7807.82s)]
*  among both protesters and the police. This study establishes a precise timeline for various events [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7813.74s)]
*  of the massacre, the locations of both the shooters and the government snipers and the [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7820.0599999999995s)]
*  specific timeline. End quote. And so after meticulously reconstructing the crime scene, [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7824.7s)]
*  using the mountains of surveillance footage and cell phone video, pictures, interviews, etc. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7831.82s)]
*  It says, quote, [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7837.900000000001s)]
*  This academic investigation concludes that the massacre was a false flag operation, [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7840.3s)]
*  which was rationally planned and carried out with a goal of the overthrow of the government [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7846.22s)]
*  and seizure of power. It found various evidence of the involvement of an alliance of the far-right [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7851.26s)]
*  organizations, specifically the right sector and Svoboda and oligarchic parties such as Fatherland. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7857.1s)]
*  Concealed shooters and spotters were located in at least 20 Maidan-controlled buildings or areas. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7863.900000000001s)]
*  The various evidence that the protesters were killed from these locations includes some 70 [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7871.34s)]
*  testimonies, primarily by Maidan protesters, several videos of snipers targeting protesters [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7876.38s)]
*  from these buildings, comparisons of positions of the specific protesters at the time of their [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7883.34s)]
*  killing and their entry wounds, and bullet impact signs. The study uncovered various [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7889.02s)]
*  videos and photos of armed Maidan snipers and spotters in many of these buildings. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7894.9400000000005s)]
*  The paper presents implications of these findings for understanding the nature of the change of the [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7900.22s)]
*  government in Ukraine, the civil war in Donbass, Russian military intervention in Crimea and Donbass, [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7905.02s)]
*  and an international conflict between the West and Russia over Ukraine. End quote. Now, [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7912.22s)]
*  does that mean that that's what happened? No. But the people saying that it was a massacre [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7918.54s)]
*  carried out by Ukrainian police at the order of Yanukovych haven't presented any evidence for [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7925.18s)]
*  their position, so it's as good a theory as anything else we got. The hardcore groups like [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7930.94s)]
*  right sector certainly had the capability and they had the motive. And in my opinion, [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7936.62s)]
*  it's very questionable whether Yanukovych, who was perfectly well aware of how these color [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7942.14s)]
*  revolutions depended on provoking the authorities into violent action, had any motive at all [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7946.94s)]
*  to order people to just randomly fire on the crowd. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7952.219999999999s)]
*  The pro-Maidan militants, as things really got underway, sent an armed squad to Viktor [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7958.379999999999s)]
*  Yanukovych's residence, and they got there just after he had already fled the country by helicopter. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7963.259999999999s)]
*  And when they arrived, they saw his caravan of vehicles, like his presidential convoy, leaving [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7969.179999999999s)]
*  as a decoy, and according to reports, they start shooting at them. So probably they were there to [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7976.14s)]
*  kill Viktor Yanukovych before he escaped to Russia. So the country's in chaos. You've got these [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7981.660000000001s)]
*  hardcore extremist groups going around now intimidating and attacking and just disappearing [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7987.820000000001s)]
*  people who opposed the coup. A bunch of them have been implicated by outside groups, [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7993.660000000001s)]
*  human rights organizations for torture and murder. The first act of the new government, [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=7999.02s)]
*  the first thing they did was to ban Russian as Ukraine's second official language. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8004.86s)]
*  And so then the people of the Donbass region in eastern Ukraine, which are mostly ethnic [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8010.86s)]
*  Russians and Russian speakers, said, to hell with this, we're out of here. And they declared their [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8015.82s)]
*  independence. And the newly constituted Ukrainian government declared war on those regions that [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8020.62s)]
*  refused to go along with the coup. They bombarded and assaulted the Donbass from 2014 right on up [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8026.94s)]
*  until the recent Russian invasion killed some 14,000 people, thousands of civilians. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8033.9s)]
*  Some 1.5 to 2 million refugees fled the region into Russia and Belarus. You keep hearing about [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8041.259999999999s)]
*  all the refugees fleeing Ukraine into Poland and other Eastern European countries now from [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8048.62s)]
*  the Russian assault. And that's very real. That's definitely true. But over the last eight years, [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8053.82s)]
*  you've had like maybe 2 million refugees who have had to flee the Ukrainian government's [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8057.5s)]
*  attack on the Donbass. And so people talk as if Ukraine suddenly found itself in a war in the [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8061.42s)]
*  year 2022. But the Ukrainian military has been attacking the ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8068.62s)]
*  for eight years. Russia started sending materiel and some special forces advisors [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8073.9s)]
*  to help out the rebels there. But Vladimir Putin watched for eight years, watched 14,000 people [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8080.78s)]
*  get killed before he ordered the Russian military to intervene directly. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8087.5s)]
*  I'm sorry if that sounds like I'm defending Vladimir Putin, but that is just what happened. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8093.26s)]
*  Not long after the new government was set up, three Ukrainian members of parliament stated [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8099.66s)]
*  publicly that now is the time to throw the Russians out of their Navy base in Crimea, [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8104.78s)]
*  their most important Navy base, one of their most important military bases period, [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8109.66s)]
*  to throw them out of their Navy base in Crimea. The Russians had agreed to just abide by the [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8113.9s)]
*  status quo of Crimea, even though the people there thought they were Russian and everybody [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8119.74s)]
*  kind of thought it was part of Russia. But they were like, okay, Ukraine can have it as long as [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8124.0599999999995s)]
*  you let us pay you to keep our naval base. And so they gave them a 99 year lease and Russia was up [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8128.62s)]
*  to date on their payments. But now you've got Ukrainian parliamentary members saying let's [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8133.099999999999s)]
*  throw the Russians out. And so at that point, Vladimir Putin tells the military personnel who [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8137.099999999999s)]
*  were already there in Crimea at the Sevastopol Naval Base, you hear like that the Russians [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8142.54s)]
*  invaded Crimea, they really didn't. Those troops were already in Crimea at the base. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8149.74s)]
*  He ordered them to go out and secure the Crimean Peninsula and they did. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8154.14s)]
*  Few people died, but I think six people died, but it's never even been confirmed that they [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8158.38s)]
*  were killed by Russian forces. The Crimeans had always identified as Russian. I mean, [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8164.54s)]
*  Crimea was a part of Russia until Khrushchev transferred its administration to Ukraine in [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8170.54s)]
*  1954 as part of an internal Communist Party power struggle. And so a referendum was held and 90 [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8176.38s)]
*  some percent of the people voted to join the Russian Federation. A vote that even the people [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8182.94s)]
*  who hate Russia don't doubt was more or less accurate. The people of the Donbass then held [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8187.58s)]
*  similar votes not long after with similar results, but Vladimir Putin said no, he declined to annex [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8193.58s)]
*  that territory. So now if you're American, I'll try to put this in more familiar terms, [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8199.66s)]
*  just imagine that the January 6th protesters, if you're a liberal or just make it Antifa if [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8208.3s)]
*  you're on the other side, whatever, I'll go with the January 6th protesters. If instead of running [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8215.74s)]
*  into the Capitol, they decided to camp out and turn it into a long-term event like Occupy Wall [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8220.539999999999s)]
*  Street. Goes on for a while and as it's going on, money starts flowing in from the Russian [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8226.46s)]
*  government and groups connected to it to put on concerts and provide people there with food and [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8235.099999999999s)]
*  drinks and blankets and whatever else they need to keep the thing going. And then high officials [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8241.019999999999s)]
*  from the Russian government, very high officials, think like equivalent to John McCain, start showing [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8246.3s)]
*  up and giving speeches to the protesters, encouraging them to keep up the fight against [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8251.9s)]
*  the corrupt American government and taking pictures with people literally wearing Nazi insignia in the [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8256.22s)]
*  photographs. Then those protesters do try to storm the Capitol and the police set up barricades, [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8262.779999999999s)]
*  but the protesters set the barricades on fire. They start throwing bottles and rocks and Molotov [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8270.539999999999s)]
*  cocktails that set policemen on fire. Buildings all around the Capitol have been occupied and [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8276.7s)]
*  placed under the control of the protesters and snipers can be seen in the windows of those buildings. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8283.980000000001s)]
*  Then violence breaks out and they successfully overthrow the government of the United States [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8291.26s)]
*  and they're in power now. So then protests against the coup break out in liberal cities all over the [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8296.300000000001s)]
*  country and the new government sends heavily armed gangs of neo-Nazis alongside government forces [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8302.06s)]
*  to go put down the protests and in several cases they just massacre people. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8308.539999999999s)]
*  Then the first action taken by the new government is to ban the Spanish language. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8314.699999999999s)]
*  Literally, again, the first legislative action taken by the post-Maidan Ukrainian government was [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8319.74s)]
*  to ban Russian as one of the country's official languages. So in this example, let's say that the [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8324.38s)]
*  new coup government bans Spanish. So following that, the heavily Hispanic regions of the southwest [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8329.34s)]
*  say, you know, screw this noise, we're under no obligation to be governed by these people who just [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8338.62s)]
*  seize power by force and are taking measures that are clearly directed against us. So they declare [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8344.460000000001s)]
*  themselves the free Latino Republic. Then the government starts sending real military forces [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8350.22s)]
*  to attack them with heavy weapons and training and intelligence provided by Russia. And so the [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8356.78s)]
*  Mexican government sees this and they say, well, we got to do something. And so they start providing [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8364.86s)]
*  aid and advisement to the free Latino Republic and Russia reacts by coordinating global sanctions [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8370.54s)]
*  against Mexico. And throwing the fact that everybody knows, everybody around the world [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8377.58s)]
*  knows that Russia's already pulled off similar operations in a half dozen of Mexico's allies in [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8383.1s)]
*  just the few preceding years. And then finally, after eight years of attacks by this new American [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8387.9s)]
*  government against the free Latino Republic, in which some 14,000 people were killed in the [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8395.18s)]
*  breakaway regions, again, including thousands of civilians, millions of refugees are forced to flee [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8401.74s)]
*  the region into Mexico. After eight years of that, finally, the Mexican government decides it has to [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8407.74s)]
*  intervene directly and it launches a military attack against the American government that [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8415.74s)]
*  sees power in the coup. Now that is a close approximation to what has happened in Ukraine [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8420.3s)]
*  since 2014. And that story doesn't mean you have to think that Mexico would have been justified in [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8426.38s)]
*  launching its attack or that Russia was justified in launching their attack. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8433.1s)]
*  But it definitely turns it into something other than the black and white [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8439.1s)]
*  good versus evil story being shoveled down our throats by Western politicians in the corporate press. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8443.26s)]
*  And this podcast isn't intended to convince you that Putin is some kind of great guy. He's a [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8450.140000000001s)]
*  ruthless dude. Nobody but a ruthless dude could have seized control of Russia almost single-handedly [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8456.46s)]
*  given the state that it was in when he took power. The country was run by oligarchs who had [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8463.82s)]
*  private military forces better equipped than the Russian army. And he managed to take control of [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8470.38s)]
*  it without having a civil war. That's the kind of guy that can inspire fear in people. He's a ruthless [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8475.5s)]
*  dude. And this doesn't detract from what the Ukrainian people are going through right now [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8481.66s)]
*  or what they've been going through. It doesn't detract from their hopes or aspirations. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8489.42s)]
*  But I'll say what I said at the beginning. I am an American. My concern is with what my country does [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8495.1s)]
*  and has been doing. And if a real war were to break out, of course the Ukrainians are already [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8502.38s)]
*  in a real war, but if a great power war were to break out, and I asked myself if we had done [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8509.98s)]
*  everything on our end to avoid the conflict, I have to say that the obvious answer is no. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8517.82s)]
*  That in fact we have been doing everything possible to provoke, prolong, and inflame the situation. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8526.06s)]
*  And to be honest, I don't know how anybody could deny that in good faith. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8535.18s)]
*  Now that the war is on, I gotta say it's really striking how excited so many American leaders [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8540.46s)]
*  are about it. They're just so corrupt and disgusting. They're just giddy about it. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8548.14s)]
*  And I guess I could go on forever here, but I'll leave it there. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8557.18s)]
*  All I hope is that this war ends as soon as possible, by almost any means possible, [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8561.26s)]
*  and that we as Americans can take an honest look at what our own corrupt ruling class [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8568.539999999999s)]
*  has done to help bring things to this point. Thank you for listening. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8576.3s)]
*  Again under the sun [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8597.58s)]
*  Every 12 minutes another one's gone [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8603.9s)]
*  The sweets in your makeup, the splashes on your lips [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8610.46s)]
*  As a nuclear warhead explodes in his hips [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8617.18s)]
*  His hips [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8620.78s)]
*  The science just to say that we gotta do something soon [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8623.980000000001s)]
*  But sitting around talking about it ain't gonna shock that half moon [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8630.54s)]
*  Where we begin [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8637.58s)]
*  When we're the end [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8640.86s)]

*  When we're the end [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8645.66s)]
*  When... [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8649.82s)]
*  The one who's in labor [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8665.34s)]

*  Somebody take the fan away or I'm gonna lay here without [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8672.06s)]
*  The doctor rushes in [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8678.06s)]
*  Pushes me little skin [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8681.06s)]
*  And says, oh come on now you better not cry [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8685.06s)]
*  You go slowly [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8690.06s)]
*  And you won't feel lonely [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8693.06s)]
*  But everybody keeps on rushing around [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8697.06s)]
*  Just when they are [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8702.06s)]
*  Mr. Politician, can't you see [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8732.06s)]
*  You're gonna kill everything, you and you and me [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8752.06s)]
*  So why are you talking in your [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8758.06s)]
*  In your sense clothes [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnaNxkgVBMY&t=8763.06s)]
