Video Description: This is part 2 of a series I’ve been working on with Daniele Bolelli. In part 1, he covered the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre carried out by the US Army. I was working on my next major series when Daniele asked me to do a companion episode on My Lai, and I couldn’t pass up the opportunity. From his description:

# #10 - Anything That Moves - The My Lai Massacre (w/History on Fire)
**Martyr Made:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack)

*  You're about to hear Anything That Moves, a podcast about the My Lai Massacre carried [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8.6s)]
*  out by American troops in Vietnam. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=14.08s)]
*  This episode was done in conjunction with one by my friend Daniela Bollelli, who has [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  also released an episode on the Sand Creek Massacre. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=22.34s)]
*  Both episodes are quite disturbing, so listener discretion is advised, not something to listen [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=27.56s)]

*  Well, like I said, this is a dark one, so maybe I shouldn't tell you that I hope you [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=68.72s)]
*  enjoy it, but in any case, here we go. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=75.32s)]
*  I'm content to die for my beliefs. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=81.12s)]
*  So cut off my head and make me a martyr. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  The people will always remember it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=91.76s)]
*  No, they will forget. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  God is a thought. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=102.72s)]
*  God is an idea. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  It is a place. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=107.44s)]
*  It is somewhere. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=108.68s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=111.68s)]
*  But its reference is to something that transcends all things. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  I must come to my senses. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=123.68s)]
*  I must tear ourselves apart for this small question of religion. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=125.28s)]
*  March 16, 1968. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=129.28s)]
*  Around 0730 hours local time in Vietnam, Chief Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson and his helicopter [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=137.48s)]
*  crew are arriving on station to prepare for battle. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=143.72s)]
*  Their mission is supposed to be routine enough, at least for the men in the air it was going [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=147.28s)]
*  to be, as far as these things go. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=152.0s)]
*  And the morning itself was clear and muggy and that too was about as ordinary as any [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=154.28s)]
*  morning could be expected to be in Vietnam in 1968. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=159.48s)]
*  Now Hugh Thompson's helo would be coming in and joining several others to provide reconnaissance [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=163.28s)]
*  and air gunnery support to the ground forces that were preparing to assault an enemy stronghold [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=169.8s)]
*  in a hot part of the country known to the Americans as Pinkville. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=174.32s)]
*  The Pinkville region was the birthplace of the Viet Minh and the Viet Cong. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=178.68s)]
*  The Viet Cong battalion that the ground forces would be facing had a fierce reputation. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  They'd been giving fits to American patrols and positions all over Quang Ngai province [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=188.68s)]
*  in that northern part of South Vietnam for months. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=192.56s)]
*  Thompson's mission was a dangerous one. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=196.68s)]
*  Flying in low over the rice paddies and treetops trying to draw fire or to flush out the hidden [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  enemy and make them run. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=205.52s)]
*  It's not really too far to say that they were bait, which is one of the reasons that the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=207.8s)]
*  helicopters for these missions, you look at them, they're basically just an airframe. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=212.36s)]
*  They're built to prioritize cost effectiveness so that losses are minimized when they go [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=215.8s)]
*  down as they very, very often did. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  It's also why the American pilots running these missions during this stage of the war [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  had just a little more than a 50% chance of making it home. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=227.52s)]
*  But now Thompson, you know, Chief Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson's a military man from a military [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=232.36s)]
*  family and March 16th, 1968 starts out as just another day at work for him. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=238.04s)]
*  Taking off and heading toward the village, it's going to be under assault, Thompson flies [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=244.68s)]
*  in low anticipating fire as he approaches the tree line. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=248.04s)]
*  So his gunners are laying down fire of their own to suppress whatever might be hidden beneath [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=252.08s)]
*  the canopy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=256.32s)]
*  But they soon realized that their fire is going unanswered. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=257.56s)]
*  So they pop up a bit above the tree line to take a look around the periphery of the village [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=261.2s)]
*  as the men on the ground, the Americans on the ground begin to move into the main phase [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=265.14s)]
*  of their attack. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=269.22s)]
*  On a road below, leading out of the hamlet, there were crowds of civilians leaving the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=271.78000000000003s)]
*  area. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=276.7s)]
*  Women carrying babies with children in tow, a few elderly people, and you know, they're [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=278.46s)]
*  carrying goods on carts or sleds or in their arms because it's a market day and military [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=282.9s)]
*  intelligence had let everyone know that the village was going to be completely empty to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=289.7s)]
*  civilians because they'd be going off to market. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=292.86s)]
*  That was good, Thompson thought. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  You know, it's going to be a big fight, so get them out of the way. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  Satisfied with that sector, Thompson pops up again and veers off and leaves the scene [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=302.22s)]
*  to conduct reconnaissance in another zone. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=306.46000000000004s)]
*  But as they start to look around, something doesn't feel quite right because they expected [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=310.3s)]
*  a real fight. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=316.14s)]
*  The hamlets down below would be well defended. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=318.42s)]
*  At least 200, and possibly up to over 400 battle-hardened Viet Cong fighters. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=320.94s)]
*  But he hadn't taken a single round of enemy fire, or even seen any sign of hostile resistance [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=327.82s)]
*  up to that point. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=333.58000000000004s)]
*  There were underground tunnel networks all through the province that led to bunkers everywhere [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=336.94s)]
*  so the Viet Cong could be hiding in ambush. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=342.04s)]
*  After 15, 20 minutes maybe they're conducting reconnaissance before they loop back around [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=345.66s)]
*  to the market road with all the people on it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=351.02000000000004s)]
*  He and his crew are keeping their eyes peeled for any enemy below. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=355.58000000000004s)]
*  Instead, as Thompson's helicopter approaches the road, looking down, the crew sees all [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  the same people as before. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=366.46000000000004s)]
*  Only now the people who had been walking to the market were strewn all over the road, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=370.6s)]
*  covered in blood, dead, or screaming for the dead and from the pain of their own fatal [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=375.58s)]
*  wounds. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=382.02s)]
*  Thompson looked down and saw dead mothers holding dying babies, and old men and women [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=384.65999999999997s)]
*  lying in the unnatural postures that they had happened to fall into and bullets had [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=390.78s)]
*  torn through their bodies. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=395.26s)]
*  Children who had been smothered and protected by their dead mothers were struggling to get [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=398.58s)]
*  up and they were covered in blood, some of it their own, some of it their parents, and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=403.82s)]
*  they were crying in panic and pain trying to get their families to wake up. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=407.58s)]
*  Now Thompson and his men, they were warriors. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=412.14s)]
*  They'd seen combat and they'd shown up today to fight, they'd shown up to destroy an enemy, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=416.82s)]
*  but looking down they had never seen anything like the scene that lay before them on the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=422.74s)]
*  road to market leading out of the village called My Lai. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=427.1s)]
*  That was what was happening down there. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=432.58000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't supposed to be like this. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=435.58000000000004s)]
*  That could probably serve pretty well as a motto for most American military interventions [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=440.66s)]
*  since the second world war, but it's more true about Vietnam than just about anything. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=446.18s)]
*  Vietnam was the war when all of our illusions as a country and a people, all of our illusions [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=454.1s)]
*  about ourselves and what the American led post war global order was going to be like [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=463.06s)]
*  hit the rocks of reality and we really haven't been the same ever since. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=470.90000000000003s)]
*  The 1960s were a time of reckoning for the United States and depending on your perspective [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=475.3s)]
*  the country may have been broken during those years or maybe all the pain and turmoil was [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=483.06s)]
*  just the birth pains of something new and better, but we changed in those years. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=488.21999999999997s)]
*  We changed maybe more rapidly and profoundly than in any comparable period, maybe in our [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=492.78s)]
*  whole history, but certainly I would say probably since the civil war. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=499.18s)]
*  If I was forced to point to a moment that kicked off our modern era, I think I'd probably [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=505.5s)]
*  say that the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November of 1963 is about as good of a [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=511.41999999999996s)]
*  line as any to divide what feels to most of us like history from what feels to most [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=516.7s)]
*  of us more like the recent past, if that distinction makes any sense. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=523.7s)]
*  The second world war feels like history, even if we still have grandparents who served in [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=530.4200000000001s)]
*  it walking around it feels like history to most of us, people my age at least. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=535.82s)]
*  Vietnam doesn't quite feel historical in the same way, not yet, even though it started [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=541.58s)]
*  over 50 years ago and the generals and senior officers who led the Vietnam War almost to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=546.42s)]
*  a man all fought in World War II. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=552.62s)]
*  As I record this it's been 17 years since the 9-11 attack in 2001. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=556.8199999999999s)]
*  Well we first became involved in the Vietnam War just 17 years after the end of World War [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=563.6999999999999s)]
*  II and yet Vietnam feels qualitatively different to us than World War II, like a different [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  world, a different world from the Korean War even. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=576.1s)]
*  The Korean War ended less than a decade before we started sending advisors to Vietnam. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=579.94s)]
*  I spent some time thinking about that and talking to people about it and trying to figure [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=585.46s)]
*  out exactly why that is. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=592.14s)]
*  I guess part of it is optics, you see guys carrying M16s instead of wooden carbines into [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=596.5s)]
*  battle or the fact that we've got lots of color footage of the Vietnam War instead of [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=603.4599999999999s)]
*  the grainy black and white that we see from the Second World War. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=608.54s)]
*  That's part of it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=612.66s)]
*  You know when we watch a Vietnam movie we hear Jimi Hendrix or the Beatles on the soundtrack [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=613.66s)]
*  whereas World War II movies might feature Glenn Miller or Jimmy Dorsey or somebody else [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=620.2199999999999s)]
*  none of us have ever heard. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=626.62s)]
*  It makes a difference too I think that one war was fought by our parents while the other [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=630.18s)]
*  war was fought by our grandparents although we're kind of approaching the point now where [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=634.42s)]
*  both of them are fading a little bit deeper into our genealogies at this point. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=640.5799999999999s)]
*  All this stuff makes a difference but I don't think any of it is decisive. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=646.02s)]
*  I don't think it's the main difference. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=649.26s)]
*  There's something else that separates World War II from us but makes Vietnam feel much [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=652.9799999999999s)]
*  more familiar. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=658.3399999999999s)]
*  I think it has to do with our mentality and with our understanding of ourselves and our [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=659.74s)]
*  faith and our institutions and our perspective on the role of America and the West in general [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=665.4200000000001s)]
*  in the world. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=673.34s)]
*  The generation that fought World War II it feels almost unreal to us today but that generation [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=676.1800000000001s)]
*  had very few doubts about any of those things. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=683.08s)]
*  Despite just emerging from the Great Depression they still had very few doubts about those [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=686.4599999999999s)]
*  things. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=690.2199999999999s)]
*  The Vietnam generation harbored doubts that are still with us today. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=693.0999999999999s)]
*  Doubts that are now the standard they color our understanding of our whole history and [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=698.8199999999999s)]
*  everything we do. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=703.9s)]
*  If you make a film set in the modern day with a character who has you know that aw shucks [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=706.9799999999999s)]
*  kind of unironic faith and love for America that was basically the rule during World War [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=714.5s)]
*  II. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=720.9s)]
*  Pretty much everybody was like that. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=721.9s)]
*  If you make a movie that's set in the modern day with a character like that, that character [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=723.66s)]
*  is almost certainly going to be a figure of ridicule in the movie. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=726.8199999999999s)]
*  Or maybe the film itself will be thought of as pandering to conservatives if it's not [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=731.58s)]
*  called just outright fascist propaganda. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=736.58s)]
*  There are plenty of movies that valorize American soldiers in modern warfare but even they tend [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=742.54s)]
*  to make a point of insisting that the men are out there fighting for the man next to [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=748.3s)]
*  them. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=754.3399999999999s)]
*  It's not really about some unironic faith in the American way. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=755.3399999999999s)]
*  It's not really like that because we couldn't take it seriously today because something [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=759.3s)]
*  changed in us in the 1960s. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=763.66s)]
*  Maybe some people out there would say well of course we don't make movies like that [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=768.02s)]
*  because today we make things more realistically and nobody really thinks that way in real [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=772.14s)]
*  life but again that's a reflection of us being on the other side of this historical divide. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=777.18s)]
*  Go read or listen to accounts from the men who marched off to Vietnam voluntarily in [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=783.34s)]
*  the early days of the war in 1964 and 1965 even into 66. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=789.3s)]
*  They sound like a World War II bond salesman volunteering to go out and defend freedom [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=796.38s)]
*  and democracy around the world and they're serious about it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=801.94s)]
*  You get up to 1968, 1969, 1970 and we were having to drag otherwise good boys off to [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=805.46s)]
*  a war that they did not believe in for reasons to which they were openly hostile under orders [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=816.62s)]
*  from leaders that they no longer trusted. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=822.66s)]
*  Something happened in just those few years and whereas the conflicts that gave rise to [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=826.66s)]
*  the Second World War there was closure there. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=834.74s)]
*  They felt resolved and they feel resolved to most people today affirming a new global [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=838.94s)]
*  order. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=844.94s)]
*  The conflicts and doubts that were associated with Vietnam were never resolved and they [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=847.14s)]
*  created or maybe exposed if you want the fissures in our society that still divide [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=852.02s)]
*  us to this day. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=858.02s)]
*  The Second World War was in some ways the last gasp of an old world. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=861.42s)]
*  Like in a movie when you think the villain's dead and it jumps up one last time to make [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=867.8199999999999s)]
*  a run at the protagonist. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=872.1s)]
*  And in World War II we know who the protagonists were and we know who the monsters were. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=875.14s)]
*  To the point that you can be put in jail in many European countries for trying to be [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=881.9s)]
*  a little too nuanced about that question. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=887.74s)]
*  In Vietnam we still haven't been able to decide whether we were the good guys or not and that [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=891.54s)]
*  uncertainty has introduced a streak of doubt about whether we've ever been the good guys. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=898.9s)]
*  And that streak of doubt, self-reflection when it's healthy and maybe masochistic self-loathing [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=905.14s)]
*  when it runs out of control, that streak of doubt has in many ways come to define modernity [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=912.42s)]
*  for us at least. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=918.26s)]
*  What happened in those few years that did so much damage to the confidence and self-understanding [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=921.54s)]
*  of the most powerful nation of the dominant culture on the planet? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=927.58s)]
*  Modern policy realists or people who like to call themselves that at least, they'll [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=934.38s)]
*  often restrict their interpretation of events to narrow interests having to do with control [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=940.06s)]
*  over vital resources and drawing hard lines of deterrence for other great powers and things [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=945.74s)]
*  like that. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=951.18s)]
*  Things that have to do with... [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=952.18s)]
*  You get it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=955.46s)]
*  In those interests of course are present any conflict but in a war whose stakes can be [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=957.58s)]
*  measured in dollars and cents or tons of minerals or that are about communicating a [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=961.74s)]
*  message to other powers out there. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=967.42s)]
*  Rational calculations can usually be made to determine when the potential benefits no [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=970.0600000000001s)]
*  longer justify the costs. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=975.3s)]
*  When France and the British Empire came into conflict over a colony, neither side felt [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=980.02s)]
*  the need to push the war until one side marched on the other's capital to defend its claim. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=984.86s)]
*  When Athens and Sparta fought the Peloponnesian War on the other hand, you know, things much [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=992.22s)]
*  more fundamental had been put at stake and both sides just exhausted themselves trying [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=996.6800000000001s)]
*  to ruin and humiliate their enemy because they just couldn't give up. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1002.8000000000001s)]
*  There was something too deep at stake, too fundamental. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1008.46s)]
*  When the parties to a conflict are acting out different mythologies, that's when you [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1012.62s)]
*  get wars that can't be settled at a negotiating table. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1018.7s)]
*  In the build up to and engagement in the Vietnam War, the story that the United States was [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1023.74s)]
*  telling itself about what was happening had very little to do with the way the Vietnamese [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1028.94s)]
*  viewed the struggle. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1033.66s)]
*  And thanks to the advent of new forms of mass media, the Vietnamese version of the story [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1035.9s)]
*  started to penetrate into the consciousness of America itself mixing in with the disputes [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1040.8600000000001s)]
*  that were already roiling American society like the black civil rights movement and it [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1046.06s)]
*  really brought the conflict home in a way that the U.S. hadn't experienced in a hundred [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1050.46s)]
*  years. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1054.46s)]
*  Now the U.S. has a long tradition of kind of entering into conflicts late after the [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1056.46s)]
*  primary belligerents have already been engaged for a while and when we show up we bring along [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1065.78s)]
*  our own understanding that is usually very different from the understanding of the primary [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1070.22s)]
*  belligerents. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1075.54s)]
*  The story we bring along usually has us as the savior coming in to ensure that good triumphs [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1078.02s)]
*  over evil and the right side wins and we tend to take it very personally if the other countries [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1083.42s)]
*  involved don't recognize us that way. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1089.34s)]
*  If you haven't heard it for some just ridiculous reason, go check out Dan Carlin's Hardcore [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1093.5s)]
*  History episode, The American Peril. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1098.86s)]
*  It's about the Spanish-American war around the turn of the 19th century and he does a [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1101.74s)]
*  great job describing how the United States has always had this split personality, I think [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1106.1s)]
*  he calls it a schizophrenic giant. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1111.22s)]
*  As our power grows we develop like any other great power to have imperial and expansionist [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1114.34s)]
*  interests like any other growing nation. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1121.74s)]
*  We've got corporations like United Fruit who use their influence to get the government [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1125.02s)]
*  militarily protect its interests in Latin America, stuff like that. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1129.82s)]
*  Of course we have mining operations and ranchers who had their eyes on Native American territories [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1133.5s)]
*  and weren't going to let something as trifling as a treaty get in their way. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1139.1399999999999s)]
*  That's always existed. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1142.8999999999999s)]
*  Those interests exist in every country with the strength and the room to pursue them. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1145.02s)]
*  But from the beginning the US population in general, we've always kind of needed to think [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1149.9799999999998s)]
*  of ourselves in a certain way. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1155.04s)]
*  The Spanish didn't have to tell themselves stories about their great intentions when [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1158.74s)]
*  they were making war to maintain control over Cuba or the Philippines. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1164.58s)]
*  But the US needs a good bedtime story if we're going to intervene and take control of those [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1168.98s)]
*  islands ourselves once we defeated the Spanish in that war. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1172.9s)]
*  We entered the First World War in 1917 and we didn't make a battlefield impact really [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1179.06s)]
*  until 1918, the last year of the war. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1183.06s)]
*  So other than the scale of the thing, the First World War was a pretty traditional great [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1187.06s)]
*  power conflict. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1192.54s)]
*  And the war goals of our allies, the French and the British, they were the traditional [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1194.5s)]
*  war goals of colonial empires. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1198.94s)]
*  The long-standing strategic imperative of the British had been to prevent any big dominant [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1203.06s)]
*  power from emerging on the continent. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1208.1799999999998s)]
*  So Britain wanted to kneecap the young German empire while it still had the power to do [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1210.52s)]
*  so. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1214.74s)]
*  The French shared that goal as well, but for good measure they heaped on a desire for revenge [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1215.98s)]
*  for its loss to Germany in the 1871 war. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1220.82s)]
*  Already in the second year of the war, long before America would have anything to do with [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1225.9s)]
*  it, the French and the British were making very specific plans on how to divide up the [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1229.14s)]
*  German colonies around the world as well as how to break up and divide the remnants of [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1233.02s)]
*  the Ottoman Empire which had been targeted for destruction. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1237.34s)]
*  So it was a traditional great power war. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1240.78s)]
*  It wasn't just the underdeveloped colonies they were looking to control. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1245.3s)]
*  One secret agreement with the Russian Empire that never ended up being fulfilled because [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1247.98s)]
*  the Russian Empire collapsed, Turkey itself was supposed to be dismembered and the Russians [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1252.1s)]
*  were supposed to take control of Constantinople, which is Istanbul today. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1256.58s)]
*  So again, the First World War is a traditional great power conflict. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1262.54s)]
*  And then here comes the United States. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1265.58s)]
*  Three years in, President Woodrow Wilson with his 14 points talking about the age of colonial [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1267.94s)]
*  domination coming to an end and preaching national liberation for all peoples and demanding [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1274.42s)]
*  a generous peace agreement for Germany. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1279.7800000000002s)]
*  And France and Britain are not having any of this. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1282.8600000000001s)]
*  When they failed to take any of our high minded demands seriously, we just took our ball and [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1286.5s)]
*  went home, very frustrated and determined not to get ourselves involved in another one [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1290.7800000000002s)]
*  of these pointless squabbles between European empires that are only looking to advance their [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1295.66s)]
*  own interests. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1299.7s)]
*  And so as a result, we basically minded our business for the most part. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1302.98s)]
*  As fascism and communism rose in Europe and began to fight for control of that continent, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1306.02s)]
*  we didn't get involved in the Second World War until Japan attacked us at Pearl Harbor [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1311.34s)]
*  and made the decision for us. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1314.7s)]
*  This time at the end of the war, we were in a position to dictate terms. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1319.1s)]
*  We liberated France and Britain owed us more money than it could ever hope to repay while [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1323.6200000000001s)]
*  maintaining its global position. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1328.02s)]
*  Japan and British forces moving from the west had linked up with the Soviet Union's [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1331.74s)]
*  forces in Central Europe and Germany was divided into administrative zones controlled by the [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1337.7s)]
*  US, Britain, France and then East Germany was controlled by the USSR. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1342.14s)]
*  The city of Berlin, which itself was situated in the middle of Soviet controlled East Germany, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1348.34s)]
*  the city itself was also divided up by the four powers in a similar way. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1354.18s)]
*  So soon after the Second World War ends, just like after the First World War, the US [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1358.7s)]
*  begins to demobilize its military but pretty soon it becomes apparent that the Soviet Union [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1363.14s)]
*  is not doing that. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1367.06s)]
*  They have no intention of liberating the territories they conquered and they were consolidating [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1368.22s)]
*  communist control all over Eastern and Central Europe. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1374.3400000000001s)]
*  Stalin had built up the Soviet war machine into just an absolute juggernaut and nothing [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1379.38s)]
*  but the threat of retaliation from a nuclear armed United States could have prevented the [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1384.4s)]
*  Soviets from taking over all of Europe if Stalin had decided to do that. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1388.5800000000002s)]
*  So in February 1946, George Kennan, the top US diplomat in Moscow at the time, he sends [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1394.14s)]
*  out a telegram to Washington that basically gives his appraisal of Soviet intentions and [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1400.22s)]
*  suggesting a strategy to deal with them. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1404.8200000000002s)]
*  The USSR, he wrote, remains a revolutionary state intent on expanding its influence by [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1407.5400000000002s)]
*  spreading revolution all around the world. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1414.5800000000002s)]
*  And Soviet leadership, he said, sees no future, no future in which a permanent peace with [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1417.46s)]
*  the capitalist countries is possible. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1423.8600000000001s)]
*  A sentiment that Stalin himself helped confirm in a speech just a couple weeks later. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1426.78s)]
*  And so the only good option, said Kennan, was a policy of containment, respecting the [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1431.46s)]
*  internal sovereignty of existing communist states but opposing communist expansion into [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1438.9s)]
*  any state that's not currently already communist. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1444.3799999999999s)]
*  Contain it. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1447.54s)]
*  And so also in February of 1946, in a speech at a Missouri college, Winston Churchill, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1448.74s)]
*  you might have heard of him, he played a minor role in the Second World War as well, Winston [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1457.8999999999999s)]
*  Churchill comes to the United States and announces to the American public that an iron curtain [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1461.74s)]
*  has fallen all across Europe, locking half of the continent behind the gates of Soviet [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1466.74s)]
*  tyranny. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1471.34s)]
*  In the East, the Far East that is, he warned that Asian states and regions were ripe for [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1473.3s)]
*  communist influence and takeover. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1478.6s)]
*  And he said that Turkey and Iran, both secular Muslim countries at the time, that they had [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1480.18s)]
*  expressed anxiety about Soviet expansion too and we had to do something. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1486.5s)]
*  So soon the Truman administration begins to push back forcefully and the US takes sides [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1491.62s)]
*  against the communists in the Greek Civil War. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1496.94s)]
*  Elsewhere, communists, often with aid from the Soviet Union, are making inroads though, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1500.58s)]
*  with Mao's rebels holding the field against the Chinese nationalist government and Czechoslovakia [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1506.06s)]
*  eventually submitting to the yoke of communism. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1511.02s)]
*  The summer of 1948 sees our first direct confrontation with the USSR when the Soviets blockade West [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1514.78s)]
*  Berlin, cutting off the Americans, British, and French from the city. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1522.1399999999999s)]
*  And so a massive ongoing airlift was ordered to supply West Berlin and finally Stalin lifted [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1527.58s)]
*  the blockade rather than starting a giant war by shooting down American planes. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1533.06s)]
*  And to many people in the West at the time, that incident helped confirm that the communists [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1538.02s)]
*  could be forced to back down, but they had to be confronted. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1543.26s)]
*  You had to challenge them. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1546.9399999999998s)]
*  And you had to risk it. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1550.46s)]
*  You had to step up, but they would back down, if only because of the growing US nuclear [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1551.8999999999999s)]
*  arsenal. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1556.54s)]
*  But just two months after the blockade ended, the Soviets successfully tested an atom bomb [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1559.02s)]
*  of their own. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1563.1s)]
*  One month after that, China falls to the communists. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1566.1s)]
*  And this, it's hard to describe how shocking and crazy this was at the time. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1569.1s)]
*  I mean, well, if you know a little bit about the history of China, you just try to wrap [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1576.22s)]
*  your head around what that must have meant. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1582.7s)]
*  And so everybody is accusing one another. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1584.54s)]
*  To this day, there's arguments about who's to blame for losing China. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1586.94s)]
*  The thinking went at the time that not enough had been done. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1593.5s)]
*  Not enough had been done to help the Chinese nationalists against the communists. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1597.0s)]
*  Just as too little had been done to help the opponents of communism in Russia after the [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1601.8999999999999s)]
*  Russian Revolution. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1605.46s)]
*  And now the two largest countries on the Eurasian landmass are united under the red flag of [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1606.82s)]
*  international communism, because we hadn't done enough. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1611.94s)]
*  Now that wasn't really true. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1615.7800000000002s)]
*  It wasn't really true that they were united under a red banner or any other banner. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1618.38s)]
*  The Soviets and the Chinese were wary of each other almost from the beginning. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1623.8200000000002s)]
*  But this was how most people saw it in the West at the time. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1629.3400000000001s)]
*  And determined to stop the virus from spreading from China to consume the Korean peninsula, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1634.3400000000001s)]
*  we went to war in Korea in 1950. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1641.4199999999998s)]
*  It's a war we don't think or talk all that much about these days, but it was a really [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1645.54s)]
*  horrible war. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1649.62s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1650.62s)]
*  Americans took almost 150,000 casualties. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1652.6599999999999s)]
*  So it's not a minor war. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1654.86s)]
*  If you want a taste of how this forgotten war was for our side, there's a PBS documentary [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1659.1399999999999s)]
*  from their, I think it's from their American Experience series. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1665.1s)]
*  It's on the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1668.58s)]
*  Go check that out. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1671.26s)]
*  That's not a place you wanted to be. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1673.46s)]
*  Freezing daytime temperatures, about 30,000 US allied forces were encircled and attacked [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1675.1s)]
*  by about 120,000 Chinese soldiers who had poured across the border under orders from [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1681.5s)]
*  Mao to annihilate the UN force there. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1686.66s)]
*  Again, it was a big war. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1689.3799999999999s)]
*  150,000 casualties is no joke, especially coming just a few years after the Second World [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1693.22s)]
*  War. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1697.02s)]
*  But the Chinese took over half a million casualties. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1698.66s)]
*  And that was nothing compared to what the Koreans suffered. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1702.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, when it was all said and done, the North and South combined suffered at least [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1704.6200000000001s)]
*  600,000 battle casualties and up to two and a half million civilian casualties. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1708.46s)]
*  But for the first time in American history, a war ended without an American victory as [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1715.38s)]
*  the country was split in half at the borders that still stand between North and South Korea [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1722.38s)]
*  today. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1726.58s)]
*  But still, just as with the Berlin blockade, to some the Korean War had been yet another [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1727.58s)]
*  demonstration that the well of communist fervor was not completely bottomless. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1735.74s)]
*  You could break them and force them to stop. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1743.5s)]
*  Its advance could be stemmed with enough steadfast opposition. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1746.22s)]
*  The important thing, many people thought, was to just, you had to remove the incentive [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1752.5s)]
*  for revolution by making it clear that communist expansion anywhere in the world would be opposed [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1757.1s)]
*  and that we would not back down, so you might as well not even try it. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1763.06s)]
*  That was the idea. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1767.82s)]
*  But what exactly was even meant by communist expansion? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1770.98s)]
*  We had a very simplistic view of communism back then. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1774.34s)]
*  We thought of it as one big world revolution. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1776.7s)]
*  North Korea, China, Soviet, you just all one big thing kind of expanding out from that [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1780.8600000000001s)]
*  Eurasian center and it was not really like that at all. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1785.66s)]
*  What does Korea have to do with Moscow? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1791.6200000000001s)]
*  Was it appropriate to refer to an indigenous communist revolution as an expansion of anything? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1794.5800000000002s)]
*  Even if they are getting some kind of help from Moscow or from China, is anything really [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1802.06s)]
*  expanding if it's coming from within the country? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1806.58s)]
*  Holding the line against Russian tanks in Europe is one thing, but should the doctrine [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1810.62s)]
*  of containment mean that we have to take sides against an indigenous movement calling itself [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1814.78s)]
*  communist however thin and tenuous the thread connecting it to doctrine or Marxism, Leninism [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1819.9399999999998s)]
*  or to Soviet political control? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1826.06s)]
*  At the time the answer was yes. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1828.4199999999998s)]
*  It was a resounding yes. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1831.5s)]
*  Because if the Soviets were supporting the communist side in these civil wars and these [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1834.54s)]
*  other local conflicts, at least the thinking went, the Soviets were supporting the communist [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1837.3799999999999s)]
*  sides and we stood by and did nothing, then one by one countries around the world would [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1842.3799999999999s)]
*  fall and by the time the danger was acute enough to force us to act, the communists [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1846.54s)]
*  would be too strong to oppose. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1851.34s)]
*  And again, it's necessary to be clear about the terrifying nature of the communist threat. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1855.1399999999999s)]
*  It was very real. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1860.8999999999999s)]
*  The Soviet Union had slaughtered and enslaved tens of millions of its own people as policy [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1861.9s)]
*  during peacetime. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1869.22s)]
*  Wherever communism spread, unbelievable brutality followed in its wake. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1872.1000000000001s)]
*  Under Mao, China would kill maybe 50 million people. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1879.7800000000002s)]
*  And so the strategists at the time had to deal with the world as it was with the information [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1884.98s)]
*  that they had and a lot of the information that they had regarding communism was truly [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1890.8s)]
*  horrifying and I do want to be very clear about that. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1896.36s)]
*  The thing is though that the US was very new to the empire business. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1900.84s)]
*  We dabbled a bit in the Western Hemisphere as I mentioned a few minutes ago. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1908.24s)]
*  We dabbled in the Philippines, a few places here and there, but the idea that we needed [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1911.78s)]
*  a detailed strategy for the Korean peninsula or for Indochina, that was new to American [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1916.02s)]
*  political consciousness. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1921.6s)]
*  We didn't have a big sort of bureaucratic infrastructure and built up generational expertise [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1924.16s)]
*  to kind of deal with this stuff. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1931.06s)]
*  We didn't have strong intelligence networks all over the world that keep us apprised. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1933.34s)]
*  We just didn't have any of that stuff. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1938.98s)]
*  Our allies on the other hand, in particular Britain but also France, they'd had long standing [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1942.3s)]
*  imperial interests all over the world. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1948.2s)]
*  Very savvy countries. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1951.98s)]
*  India was still under British control until 1947. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1955.1399999999999s)]
*  France still ruled Indochina, the region that included Vietnam. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1959.44s)]
*  And so it was all over Asia, Africa, the Middle East. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1963.9199999999998s)]
*  These were dead empires walking at the time, bankrupt and exhausted from a generation of [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1968.3s)]
*  fratricidal war, but again they were very savvy. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1972.98s)]
*  A long, long, long time of operating all over the world. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1976.18s)]
*  They were much more savvy than the US in many ways at the time. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1979.98s)]
*  And so they looked to the US to help preserve their interests. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1985.7s)]
*  Things were changing in what would start to be called the third world, those unaligned, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1990.8999999999999s)]
*  undeveloped countries that had laboured and suffered and in various ways sometimes benefited [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=1995.62s)]
*  from European colonization for so long. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2000.4799999999998s)]
*  That illusion of difference between direct colonial rule and rule by proxy through a [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2004.6599999999999s)]
*  local minority or through a subservient dictator, that distinction began to melt away and people [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2009.34s)]
*  began to see through it, to begin to rise up. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2014.28s)]
*  Sometimes politically, sometimes violently. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2018.32s)]
*  All over the world people were beginning to wake up and demand recognition and independence. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2021.54s)]
*  As it started to happen you'd begin to see a familiar pattern of development in these [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2028.34s)]
*  political challenges and these budding insurgencies. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2032.26s)]
*  It's similar in many ways, not in the details but in the dynamics, it's similar in many [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2036.22s)]
*  ways to what we saw with the Arab Spring starting in 2011. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2040.96s)]
*  In the beginning challenges to the status quo were being driven by all kinds of people [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2045.54s)]
*  with all types of different ideas about where they'd like to see things end up. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2050.44s)]
*  But over time, especially in the face of state repression or civil war, it's the groups that [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2055.64s)]
*  already have a good on the ground infrastructure and who are the best organized and funded [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2064.32s)]
*  and who can gain credibility through outside recognition and support. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2069.2400000000002s)]
*  Those groups are the ones that remain standing when everything shakes out. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2073.36s)]
*  In the anti-colonial movement this tended to be the communists, in the Arab Spring it [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2079.52s)]
*  tended to be the Islamist hardliners, but the dynamic was very similar. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2083.7599999999998s)]
*  College kids can take to the streets and maybe crack open some fissures in the status quo, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2089.04s)]
*  but when the pavement starts getting slick with blood you're going to need groups with [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2094.38s)]
*  access to weapons and supplies and expertise and places to hide. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2097.32s)]
*  People who are used to operating in the underground economy, who know how to organize and recruit [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2102.54s)]
*  for a persistent insurgency over time and who have enough ideological commitment to [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2107.1s)]
*  do the very hard things required for an insurgency to survive and win. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2112.94s)]
*  One of the things that really compromised the global efforts of the US and its allies [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2121.02s)]
*  during the Cold War was that the Soviets were able to employ a very, very effective narrative [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2126.66s)]
*  for their propaganda. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2132.74s)]
*  The communists were able to say to the third world, hey look, we thought we were fighting [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2135.54s)]
*  World War II to defeat fascism. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2141.38s)]
*  We did fight to defeat fascism, but look at the US now, allied to Germany and Japan, allowing [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2143.74s)]
*  much of their old bureaucracies to remain in place. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2150.86s)]
*  On top of that, the US is allied to the colonial powers like France and Britain who even now [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2154.98s)]
*  are fighting against your national liberation as the French and the British were in many [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2161.5s)]
*  places. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2165.3s)]
*  Well, we the communists, we were allied with them to defeat fascism and liberate all the [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2166.3s)]
*  peoples of the world and we're still doing that, but now they're the fascists. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2171.26s)]
*  They're allied to Germany and they're allied to Japan, they're allied to the colonialists. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2176.34s)]
*  Now they're the fascists and we're here to help liberate you from them. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2181.4s)]
*  It was a powerful propaganda, very difficult to counter in many ways. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2185.74s)]
*  And in the places where it was applied, if you didn't necessarily pay too much attention [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2191.74s)]
*  to what communist liberation ended up looking like after it happened, it was very difficult [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2196.8599999999997s)]
*  propaganda to counter. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2201.14s)]
*  Looking back, we might think that our magnanimity in helping to rebuild Germany and Japan was [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2205.42s)]
*  wise and moral and I think it certainly was, but at the time it's very hard to justify [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2211.9s)]
*  it to people who had just gotten finished suffering under the boots of the Nazis of [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2217.82s)]
*  the Imperial Japanese. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2222.58s)]
*  You know, and it was true that France and Britain were still repressing, sometimes very [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2224.06s)]
*  brutally, liberation movements anywhere in the world that they could still afford to [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2229.58s)]
*  do it. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2233.5s)]
*  An ugly, ugly urban war of murder and reprisal between France and the Algerian nationalist [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2235.9s)]
*  insurgents would create 300,000 casualties, displace over 2 million Algerians. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2241.7s)]
*  Indochina had been liberated from Japan after the Second World War only to be reclaimed [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2248.8199999999997s)]
*  as a possession by France and they immediately start fighting to hold on to it. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2253.2599999999998s)]
*  That fight would kill maybe a quarter million Vietnamese. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2258.0s)]
*  When the Shah of Iran was pushed aside by a socialist politician who would try to nationalize [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2262.5s)]
*  British oil assets in the country, the American CIA helped restore the Shah in part to prevent [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2267.38s)]
*  likely British military action against Iran and this was justified by the claim that inaction [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2273.7000000000003s)]
*  would have left Iran to fall into the Soviet orbit. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2278.58s)]
*  It's the chorus of the Cold War. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2282.54s)]
*  This is the dynamic, this is how it goes. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2287.2200000000003s)]
*  For years this is how it works. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2289.02s)]
*  The European colonial empires have been weakened irreparably by World War II and the peoples [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2290.7000000000003s)]
*  of the Third World were waking up and demanding independence and in most cases outside the [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2295.54s)]
*  Middle East, communists would emerge as the most effective and durable insurgents and [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2300.54s)]
*  eventually they'd swallow up the rest of the independence movement in those countries. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2305.1s)]
*  The Middle East was a little bit different because the official atheism of communism [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2308.7799999999997s)]
*  obviously ran counter to the Islamic principles in that region. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2314.86s)]
*  Many places like Vietnam, the communists eventually just swallowed up the rest of the movement, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2319.06s)]
*  and it pretty much became synonymous with the movement for decolonization, anti-imperialism [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2324.7799999999997s)]
*  and national liberation. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2330.18s)]
*  Again, this was very powerful propaganda that the communists pumped out all over the world [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2332.18s)]
*  so despite the abject repression of communist totalitarianism, many people began, they really [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2337.3399999999997s)]
*  did begin to see the United States very differently from how the US envisioned itself acting in [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2343.7s)]
*  the world. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2349.94s)]
*  That's how you get yourself into trouble. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2350.94s)]
*  And I have to admit, I've got a certain amount of resentment toward the French and the British [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2354.1s)]
*  during this period. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2360.3s)]
*  Like I said, they were very savvy operators on the world stage and as their empires were [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2362.7000000000003s)]
*  collapsing they looked to the US to help shore them up wherever they could and the way it [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2367.34s)]
*  often went was they'd come smash down on some local independence movement until only the [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2372.2200000000003s)]
*  communists were left and then they look over to us and say, America, look, we're fighting [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2376.8s)]
*  the communists over here. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2382.1600000000003s)]
*  You don't want this country to fall to the Reds, do you? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2383.92s)]
*  And I don't want to be too naive about it. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2387.92s)]
*  Obviously there were a lot of people in American leadership and many of them were just as informed [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2389.6400000000003s)]
*  and cynical as the coldest official in the British Foreign Office, but the political [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2395.54s)]
*  reality in the US, it was such that while people liked the idea of defending free people [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2399.86s)]
*  from communist tyranny, you were not going to move the American people to do anything [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2406.58s)]
*  that made them feel like they might be the tyrants. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2411.38s)]
*  Just wasn't going to happen. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2413.86s)]
*  And so then this walks us into Vietnam. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2417.34s)]
*  This is exactly how it went down in Vietnam. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2420.02s)]
*  The French framed their war in Vietnam, which had begun immediately after the Second World [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2421.74s)]
*  War ended, as a crusade against communism. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2426.24s)]
*  Even though by the early 1950s this propaganda was even wearing off with their own people, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2429.86s)]
*  the French people, this was the only way to get help from the Americans. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2435.08s)]
*  And so American advisors first arrived to aid the French and the South Vietnamese in [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2440.36s)]
*  1950. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2445.08s)]
*  Most people don't know the first Americans got to Vietnam in 1950, but that's when they [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2446.08s)]
*  arrived. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2451.12s)]
*  It was just when we were entering the Korean War. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2452.12s)]
*  And already by that time the US was providing most of the funding for the French war in [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2455.04s)]
*  Vietnam. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2458.72s)]
*  In 1954, a French outpost at a place called Diem Bien Phu, in the far north of the country, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2459.72s)]
*  was surrounded and overrun by the North Vietnamese army under the leadership of General Vo Nguyen [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2467.2799999999997s)]
*  Giapp. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2473.3999999999996s)]
*  He's one of my military heroes for sure. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2474.3999999999996s)]
*  There's a book out called The Military Art of People's War. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2479.9599999999996s)]
*  It's a collection of his writings. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2483.24s)]
*  It's a great book. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2485.2s)]
*  It's to be on everyone's shelf who's interested in military history. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2486.2s)]
*  He's one of the great military men of the 20th century for sure. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2489.2s)]
*  The French had already been losing the war of attrition slowly. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2494.3999999999996s)]
*  They had suffered tens of thousands of casualties by this time. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2497.68s)]
*  But this defeat at Diem Bien Phu, I mean, it delivered a shock that is really hard to [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2501.2799999999997s)]
*  convey to people today. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2507.24s)]
*  It would be hard for us to think of a modern equivalent to losing a battle or a war to [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2509.3199999999997s)]
*  the Germans. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2517.0s)]
*  But here's one thing. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2518.0s)]
*  When it came to fighting the local populations of their colonies around the world, the European [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2519.88s)]
*  powers were not used to losing. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2524.34s)]
*  They might have a small unit get surrounded in an encampment or something and get wiped [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2528.12s)]
*  out and then they'd come in and take their revenge. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2533.48s)]
*  But they were used to engagements like the Battle of Omdurman, where about 8,000 British [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2536.56s)]
*  soldiers and their local allies defeated over 50,000 Sudanese fighters, killing, wounding [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2541.92s)]
*  or capturing 30,000 of the enemy and only losing a few dozen British men. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2547.64s)]
*  And understand how it felt for over 11,000 French soldiers to surrender and be marched [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2554.3199999999997s)]
*  into captivity by a local force of an undeveloped country like Vietnam. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2560.3599999999997s)]
*  You'd almost have to imagine 11,000 US Marines laying down their arms and being taken prisoner [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2566.2799999999997s)]
*  by ISIS or the Taliban. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2572.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's not to compare ISIS or the Taliban to the North Vietnamese in character, but [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2575.64s)]
*  just insofar as it was something that seemed impossible and just can't happen. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2579.4s)]
*  And more than that, the fact that it did happen, that it signified a fundamental change in [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2588.8799999999997s)]
*  the world that boded very ill for the non-communist West. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2594.8799999999997s)]
*  After Dien Bien Phu, and again this is in 1954, the French have had enough. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2600.44s)]
*  This is when the problems are starting to crop up in Algeria. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2605.84s)]
*  They've got a whole new issue much closer to their near abroad. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2608.52s)]
*  So they give up in Vietnam, begin to evacuate Indochina altogether. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2612.92s)]
*  There are only a few American advisors left in the country at this point to provide support [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2619.12s)]
*  to the South Vietnamese government and that's it. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2623.32s)]
*  After the French left, the communists consolidated control of the North of the country while [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2626.8s)]
*  a low-grade and disorganized insurgency in the South began to harden into something much [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2631.7200000000003s)]
*  more dangerous for the South Vietnamese government. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2635.6800000000003s)]
*  In 1960, after a few years of this insurgency, the National Liberation Front, the NLF, known [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2639.52s)]
*  better in the West as the VC, the Viet Cong, it was formed in the South to unite all the [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2647.76s)]
*  movements and militias that had risen up in opposition to the corrupt and inept Vietnamese [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2653.88s)]
*  government. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2658.6800000000003s)]
*  Around the world at this time, as all this is starting to build up, around the world [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2662.1600000000003s)]
*  communism just seems to people to be advancing almost everywhere. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2666.6400000000003s)]
*  In 1955, the Soviet Union forms the Warsaw Pact, the military alliance to counter NATO. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2671.7200000000003s)]
*  All of a sudden there were borders all over Europe that were tripwires for the next World [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2679.52s)]
*  War, this time with nuclear implications. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2684.32s)]
*  In October 1956, the Soviets just brutally crushed an uprising against the communist [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2688.48s)]
*  government in Hungary. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2693.7599999999998s)]
*  As the Hungarian rebels, the poor Hungarian rebels who had taken over central Budapest, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2696.48s)]
*  they were on the radio begging to the West to come help them and they got no help and [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2702.88s)]
*  the Soviets just crushed them. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2708.52s)]
*  At the same time that that's going on, Britain and France conspire with the Israelis to create [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2711.36s)]
*  a pretext for them to invade Egypt and seize control of the Suez Canal, something we didn't [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2717.04s)]
*  know about at the time, the Americans didn't know about, but then they were forced to retreat [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2721.52s)]
*  under American pressure because the Soviets offered aid to the Egyptian government and [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2726.3s)]
*  that became a flash point. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2729.7599999999998s)]
*  Then in 1957, the Soviets launched the Sputnik satellite, the first man-made object ever [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2732.8s)]
*  to be launched into orbit around the Earth. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2738.7200000000003s)]
*  And all at once it dawned on the world that if it was possible to launch a satellite into [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2742.6400000000003s)]
*  space it would very soon be possible to put a nuclear warhead on one of those rockets [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2746.52s)]
*  and send it to Washington D.C. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2750.98s)]
*  In 1959, just 90 miles off the coast of Florida, Cuba falls to the charismatic revolutionary [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2754.04s)]
*  Fidel Castro, who declares for communism and allies himself with the Soviet Union. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2761.0s)]
*  In April of 1961, just three months after John F. Kennedy assumes office as president, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2768.0s)]
*  the young and inexperienced Kennedy is talked into going forward with a pre-existing plan [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2773.76s)]
*  to arm and deliver a force of Cuban dissidents back onto the island to start an anti-communist [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2779.28s)]
*  uprising and take the island back, but he refused to provide any direct military support [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2783.76s)]
*  or air power support for the invasion. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2789.8s)]
*  And the invasion is just a complete catastrophe. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2793.36s)]
*  Kennedy's generals and the CIA, whose baby this whole thing was, the Bay of Pigs invasion, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2797.44s)]
*  and the generals and the CIA who were so excited about this, they blamed Kennedy for failing [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2802.7200000000003s)]
*  to provide adequate support to the Cuban exiles. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2806.5800000000004s)]
*  And Kennedy resented having been talked into the whole thing in the first place. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2809.6800000000003s)]
*  Two months later, in August 1961, the Soviets erect the Berlin Wall to keep Western intelligence [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2815.16s)]
*  agents out and to keep people trying to escape from their tyranny inside. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2820.8399999999997s)]
*  That Berlin Wall became a potent symbol of a world torn in two, where every nation was [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2826.92s)]
*  a potential battleground expected to declare for one side or the other, and the stakes [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2832.56s)]
*  were total victory or total defeat. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2837.08s)]
*  The next year, in October 1962, the Soviets attempt to install nuclear missile batteries [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2841.76s)]
*  in Cuba, and the US finds out about it, and the two powers come so close to nuclear war [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2847.5600000000004s)]
*  that senior US government officials are right later on that they were going to sleep each [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2853.6000000000004s)]
*  night with profound doubts about whether they were going to wake up. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2859.0400000000004s)]
*  And they were dead serious. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2863.2400000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2864.2400000000002s)]
*  A year later, November 1963, JFK is assassinated by a gunman in Dallas, Texas, and replaced [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2867.68s)]
*  by his vice president, Lyndon Baines Johnson. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2874.2799999999997s)]
*  The reason I'm going through all this Cold War history, I guess there's two reasons. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2879.4s)]
*  The first reason is I'm procrastinating. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2883.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't really want to talk about the subject of this episode because it's horrible, and [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2887.16s)]
*  I have not enjoyed reading about it or listening to people tell their stories about it. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2896.3599999999997s)]
*  I read a lot of dark stuff for some reason. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2903.7999999999997s)]
*  Maybe it has to do with what I talked about earlier, that these people from the Vietnam [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2907.72s)]
*  era are a lot easier for us to relate to. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2912.68s)]
*  But it's done some damage. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2915.8399999999997s)]
*  It's done some damage. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2917.72s)]
*  It's a dark story, and I'm putting it off a little bit. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2918.9199999999996s)]
*  But also, I'm trying to give you a sense of how fast, how rapidly, everything is going. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2923.4s)]
*  Everything is moving very, very quickly. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2930.76s)]
*  In 1957, the first ever satellite is launched. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2933.04s)]
*  Five years later, the Soviets are attempting to install mid-range ballistic missiles in [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2936.28s)]
*  Cuba. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2940.08s)]
*  Almost every few months, it seems like the communists are taking another bite out of [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2941.96s)]
*  the developing world, and the best we could hope for was to fight them to a stalemate [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2945.6s)]
*  as we've done in Korea. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2949.76s)]
*  If you don't understand this, it's hard to grasp how we ever ended up so deeply involved [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2952.8s)]
*  in a place like Vietnam, where from the very beginning, we were reluctant to send ground [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2956.8s)]
*  forces. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2962.32s)]
*  We knew from the very, very beginning it was a bad idea. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2963.32s)]
*  And where already in 1964, 1965, certainly by 1965, when LBJ is ordering the first major [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2966.1600000000003s)]
*  American force of 150,000 troops to invade the country, there are White House tapes of [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2974.88s)]
*  American leaders. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2980.4s)]
*  I'm talking the main players, the president, the secretary of defense in charge of the [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2981.4s)]
*  war, who had very, very serious doubts about whether the war could be won. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2985.76s)]
*  This is in 1965. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2989.88s)]
*  In the name of opposing the expansion of communism, we had effectively taken over for one side [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=2994.2000000000003s)]
*  in the Civil War. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3000.12s)]
*  And we found ourselves opposed by an enemy that, although yes, they were communists in [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3002.2000000000003s)]
*  their heads, they spouted communist ideology, and it was performative as well. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3008.2s)]
*  They were communists in their heads, they were Vietnamese in their hearts. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3016.2s)]
*  And they were not fighting for the expansion of Marxism. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3019.68s)]
*  They were fighting to expel yet another foreign occupier from their country. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3024.08s)]
*  And we walked into that, not really knowing what we were getting ourselves into. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3029.8399999999997s)]
*  Especially not knowing what we were getting ourselves into as far as who we'd be facing. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3039.04s)]
*  Because the Vietnamese could fight. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3043.44s)]
*  Something that gets lost a lot in the modern day. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3046.2s)]
*  The Vietnamese could fight. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3049.04s)]
*  Make no mistake about it. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3050.4s)]
*  A small country like Vietnam didn't hold off Chinese domination for centuries by being [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3053.52s)]
*  compromising about its independence. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3058.64s)]
*  Vietnam had a long tradition of mobilizing basically the entire able-bodied population [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3062.92s)]
*  in times of acute need when foreigners stepped foot on their soil. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3067.92s)]
*  The French had established full control over Indochina in 1885. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3072.84s)]
*  During World War II, the French had been defeated by Germany, and so they were allowed to maintain [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3077.56s)]
*  administrative control over the country during the Japanese occupation. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3081.26s)]
*  When the Japanese were defeated in 1945, and then the French were driven out in 1954, suddenly [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3086.44s)]
*  the Americans start to appear, and to most of the Vietnamese, we just seem like the next [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3092.48s)]
*  imperialist nation standing in the way of their national liberation. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3097.12s)]
*  And from their perspective, that's exactly what we were. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3101.72s)]
*  And they were going to fight us as if that's what we were. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3104.84s)]
*  And yet if you read the diaries and the letters home from the American soldiers sent to that [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3107.64s)]
*  country in the early years, they believed, they truly believed that they would be serving [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3113.6s)]
*  their country and risking their lives to go liberate the people of Vietnam from the [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3122.46s)]
*  scourge of communism. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3126.2200000000003s)]
*  They really believed it. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3127.2200000000003s)]
*  From that first decision to send 150,000 American soldiers to directly engage the Vietnamese [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3130.94s)]
*  communists on behalf of the faltering South Vietnamese government, just a terrible dynamic [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3136.42s)]
*  kind of took over in which domestic political considerations dictated a continued escalation [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3141.26s)]
*  of the war in Vietnam. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3147.18s)]
*  And it seemed like no politician, it just seems like no politician had the guts or the [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3148.18s)]
*  power or the room to operate to stop it. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3154.4199999999996s)]
*  It's hard to describe. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3157.7s)]
*  It really is. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3158.7s)]
*  But well, you know, once a president decides to go to war, you're in a war and no politician [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3160.06s)]
*  wants to be the guy who loses a war. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3168.2999999999997s)]
*  And if you're faced with a decision to increase troop levels and send some more people over [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3171.62s)]
*  there and hope you win, maybe at least you extend the war until you get out of office [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3175.7s)]
*  and the next guy can lose it and you can blame him. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3180.8199999999997s)]
*  It's a drawback of the way our political system works, I suppose. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3182.8999999999996s)]
*  And so the increase of 150,000 troops in 1965 by LBJ brought the total troop numbers up [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3188.74s)]
*  to around 185,000. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3195.2999999999997s)]
*  In 1966, we would have about 385,000 troops in the country. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3198.18s)]
*  And by 1967, almost half a million Americans were in Vietnam. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3203.38s)]
*  It was at the end of that year, in December 1967, that Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3209.6600000000003s)]
*  20th Infantry Regiment, 11th Brigade, 23rd ID under the command of Captain Ernest Medina [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3217.78s)]
*  arrived in the country. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3223.5s)]
*  Fred Widmer proudly describes himself and his comrades and Charlie Company as, quote, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3228.74s)]
*  a cross section of just your basic young people at that point in time. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3234.02s)]
*  We were from all over the country, you know, East Coast, West Coast, black, white, Mexican. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3238.58s)]
*  It was nothing special about us. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3243.9799999999996s)]
*  We were just your common, ordinary teens. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3245.3799999999997s)]
*  Growing up with parents that came from World War II and from the Korean War, being exposed [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3248.4599999999996s)]
*  to their generations, yeah, you basically felt it was your duty to go ahead and go to [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3252.94s)]
*  war. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3257.1s)]
*  And these were men that believed in the cause for which they were being sent to fight. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3258.1s)]
*  Median age was 21, 22. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3265.58s)]
*  Most of them were 18 to 22 years old. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3267.62s)]
*  They'd arrived in Hawaii in December 1966 to begin their training under their company [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3271.06s)]
*  commander Ernest Medina, Captain Ernest Medina. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3276.5s)]
*  When they got to Hawaii, you know, for many of them it was the first time ever being so [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3281.22s)]
*  far away from home and just overwhelmed by the beauty and ease of it. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3285.02s)]
*  The military probably seemed pretty awesome at the time, but Medina very quickly knocked [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3289.06s)]
*  that notion out of their head and reminded them why they were there. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3294.22s)]
*  He put them to work. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3296.98s)]
*  You know, the Vietnam generation was made up of the sons of fathers who'd been greeted [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3299.2999999999997s)]
*  as the liberating heroes of Paris and had responded to the attack on Pearl Harbor by [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3303.34s)]
*  fighting their way to Tokyo and bringing Japan to its knees. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3308.06s)]
*  And so, you know, it's a hard thing growing up in the shadow of great men. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3311.2599999999998s)]
*  And this was the next generation's chance to be heroes in their own right. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3317.06s)]
*  This is what you hear again and again and again, not just from Charlie Company, but [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3320.86s)]
*  from just men all over who fought in Vietnam. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3326.1s)]
*  Now their company commander, Captain Medina, revered by his soldiers. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3332.3s)]
*  He was really loved by them. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3338.38s)]
*  He drove them hard. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3341.0600000000004s)]
*  He was an aggressive overachiever, graduating fourth out of 200 or so in his class at officer [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3342.0600000000004s)]
*  candidate school. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3348.2200000000003s)]
*  He earned the name Mad Dog Medina within his command. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3349.2200000000003s)]
*  And again, he was a hard man. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3353.1400000000003s)]
*  He was a tough guy. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3354.42s)]
*  He was tough on his men. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3355.42s)]
*  He expected a lot from Charlie Company, but he led by example. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3357.78s)]
*  And he really tried to instill in them the aggressive attitude that had helped him rise [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3361.5s)]
*  through the ranks. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3366.5s)]
*  He was a Mexican-American at a time when the Army was really still largely led by an Anglo [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3367.5s)]
*  officer corps. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3372.86s)]
*  And for him to rise to captain and company commander was a real achievement. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3373.86s)]
*  He was a hard charger in military parlance. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3377.26s)]
*  One of his men said, quote, the motto of the Army was follow me. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3382.42s)]
*  And Medina was the type of individual you'd follow anywhere and do anything for. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3386.66s)]
*  Medina wasn't just there to do a job. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3392.62s)]
*  He wanted Charlie Company to be something really special. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3394.3799999999997s)]
*  You get a lot of commanders that are this way with their units where they get something [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3397.74s)]
*  in them that they want to, you know, they maybe want a little bit of a signature. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3402.22s)]
*  You know, when the war is over, if your unit really performs, people remember that in the [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3407.94s)]
*  military. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3412.7s)]
*  So he got his men calling themselves the Death Dealers. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3413.7799999999997s)]
*  And in preparation for Vietnam, they would collect aces of spades from playing card decks [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3417.4199999999996s)]
*  and they'd stack them up and bring them with them because they were going to leave them [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3422.06s)]
*  on the bodies of the VC that they expected to kill. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3425.02s)]
*  So everybody would would know, you know, and learn to fear and respect the Death Dealers [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3427.4199999999996s)]
*  of Charlie Company. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3432.5s)]
*  In charge of Charlie Company's first platoon was a lieutenant named William Callie. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3435.5s)]
*  And Callie's, this is a cliche by now, but Callie's a hard guy to describe. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3440.66s)]
*  When people try, they usually resort to what I'm doing right now, which is referring to [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3447.98s)]
*  just how nondescript he was. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3452.7999999999997s)]
*  He was 24 years old when Charlie Company left for Vietnam. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3456.22s)]
*  He was small and thin, 5'3", maybe 130 pounds. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3459.86s)]
*  White guy from a typical middle class family in Florida. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3465.14s)]
*  He hadn't been really popular in high school, but not unpopular. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3469.74s)]
*  He got along. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3473.3399999999997s)]
*  Classmates did remember him as always looking for ways to get the approval of his teachers, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3476.4599999999996s)]
*  though he'd volunteer to stand up and turn pages for them when they were reading to class [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3479.8999999999996s)]
*  or he would volunteer to stay after and sweep up or clean chalkboard. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3484.18s)]
*  So he was kind of a teacher's pet. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3487.54s)]
*  After high school, he kind of floated around for a bit, got in some college, worked a few [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3491.18s)]
*  different jobs and finally joined the Army. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3494.66s)]
*  Once he got into the Army, he seemed to have an experience that a lot of people, especially [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3498.4199999999996s)]
*  a lot of men like him, have when they join the military. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3503.58s)]
*  They're given a rank and a uniform. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3506.7s)]
*  In his case, he was an officer, so he's given authority over other men. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3508.74s)]
*  A young man without a strong sense of who he is or what he's supposed to be doing. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3513.02s)]
*  An empty vessel waiting for somebody to fill him up with an identity that makes him feel [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3518.58s)]
*  like a real person, maybe for the first time in his life. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3522.7599999999998s)]
*  You put someone like that in a snappy uniform and tell him he's part of an institution [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3526.06s)]
*  with a storied history and he's a representative of that institution, a defender of his country, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3530.38s)]
*  a leader of men. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3535.5s)]
*  Again, if you're not into that stuff, it sounds corny, but I can tell you it has a profound [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3536.5s)]
*  effect on a lot of people. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3541.7s)]
*  If you've ever known somebody who went off to the military, a lot of people you might [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3543.5s)]
*  know from experience or by association when you've watched a boy leave for boot camp and [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3549.42s)]
*  a man come back maybe just a couple months later. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3555.26s)]
*  It's a big change for a lot of people. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3557.38s)]
*  In the army though, while Callie got an identity out of it, he really didn't get the respect [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3561.34s)]
*  that he was hoping for from either his men or the leaders to whom he was responsible. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3566.98s)]
*  In contrast to Medina, Callie finished in the bottom quarter of his class at officer [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3573.46s)]
*  Canada school. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3577.94s)]
*  In the field, men who served with him complained that he couldn't even read a map or a compass [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3580.26s)]
*  properly. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3584.0200000000004s)]
*  He just couldn't. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3585.22s)]
*  There are people like this in every branch of the service, every rank at least up to [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3586.22s)]
*  junior officers. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3593.18s)]
*  There's just some people who just can't get it together and really don't belong and Callie [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3594.18s)]
*  probably didn't belong. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3597.1s)]
*  Well, probably. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3599.1s)]
*  I guess that'll prove to be the understatement of the podcast, but I'll go ahead and leave [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3600.3399999999997s)]
*  it in. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3605.22s)]
*  The men that were under him and Captain Medina above him, they all saw him as a suck up and [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3607.66s)]
*  that's not something you want to be seen as in the military. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3614.5s)]
*  They mocked him and resented him for it. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3618.1400000000003s)]
*  Callie was one of those unfortunate people who's disliked by other men and is never quite [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3621.34s)]
*  able to understand why. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3627.46s)]
*  So he responds by trying even harder to ingratiate himself with Medina and by pulling rank on [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3629.06s)]
*  his men. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3634.06s)]
*  Huge no no. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3635.06s)]
*  But he was an officer and he had to assert his authority, but he didn't really know how [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3637.98s)]
*  and he wasn't respected and he knew it. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3642.74s)]
*  How could he not know it? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3645.98s)]
*  Medina would often just humiliate him and undermine him in front of his own men, insult [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3646.98s)]
*  him in front of his own people. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3650.54s)]
*  So anyway, after their training is complete, Charlie Company leaves for Vietnam. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3654.42s)]
*  They arrive in Quang Ngai province in the northern part of South Vietnam in December [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3660.06s)]
*  1967. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3663.94s)]
*  And for the first month or so, it's all good. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3664.94s)]
*  I mean they saw no signs of the war at all and they spend their time swimming and playing [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3669.34s)]
*  football on the beach and you know, hamming it up with the women and children, elderly, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3674.02s)]
*  Vietnamese in the nearby villages. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3679.1000000000004s)]
*  There's videos of it. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3683.34s)]
*  They're all smiles. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3684.58s)]
*  They're very obviously relaxed and having a good time. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3685.58s)]
*  Fred Widmer, the radio man for Charlie Company, he described a typical day. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3690.98s)]
*  He said you go into a village, set up a perimeter. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3694.7000000000003s)]
*  Police would come in and treat the civilians and we'd sit there and play with the kids. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3698.02s)]
*  There was nothing else to do so we always had fun with the kids. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3702.38s)]
*  A Vietnamese described it from the other side saying, when I was young I saw American soldiers. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3707.38s)]
*  Whenever they came, they would gather up everyone. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3713.98s)]
*  They would bring cake and candy for the children. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3716.42s)]
*  Everyone would have some and then they'd let us go home. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3719.34s)]
*  Again, there's video footage and you can go watch and documentaries and stuff and they're [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3723.1800000000003s)]
*  just what you'd think. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3729.5s)]
*  Young guys, big smiles, horsing around, just obviously getting a big kick out of making [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3731.42s)]
*  the kids happy and being the big heroes, bringing them treats, stuff like that. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3737.82s)]
*  Just playing the American hero. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3741.6600000000003s)]
*  This is kind of part of why they came to go to war. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3743.78s)]
*  A survivor of their visit to My Lai just a few months later remembered, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3748.98s)]
*  I never would have imagined, never would have thought Americans would kill us. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3754.98s)]
*  When my children came home and asked if American soldiers would kill us, I said no, Americans [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3760.34s)]
*  don't kill. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3765.7400000000002s)]
*  And so about a month after they arrive, on the last day of January, the Vietnamese communists [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3769.94s)]
*  launch a massive offensive all over South Vietnam. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3777.9s)]
*  For months they'd been infiltrating the South, disguised as civilians and sometimes even [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3782.78s)]
*  disguised as women hiding AK-47s and grenades and things under their clothing. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3787.1s)]
*  Once they got into the South, they organized the Southern militias, they hid weapons and [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3793.42s)]
*  supplies and they got in position for what would become known as the Tet Offensive. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3797.02s)]
*  The Tet Offensive was eventually beaten back by the South Vietnamese Army and American [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3803.06s)]
*  forces but the scale and ferocity of it, I mean they attacked almost every major position [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3808.2599999999998s)]
*  in South Vietnam all at once. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3816.22s)]
*  It was really incredible achievement even though it didn't work out in a military sense [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3818.34s)]
*  for the North Vietnamese. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3823.54s)]
*  Again, it really shook American forces, it really shook the leaders and the public back [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3825.34s)]
*  home. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3831.54s)]
*  The U.S. Embassy in Saigon had been occupied for a while, taken over and occupied. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3833.82s)]
*  Towns and city centers had been seized and had to be taken back. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3839.02s)]
*  South Vietnamese officials in those cities and towns were rounded up and shot and what [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3842.42s)]
*  really shook them is that the attack had just seemed to come out of nowhere, as if thousands [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3847.94s)]
*  of civilians had suddenly thrown off their outer garments and just sprung into battle. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3851.94s)]
*  So as the offensive starts to lose steam, the Americans want to get back out there and [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3857.46s)]
*  retaliate. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3861.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean they were caught off guard, they had retaken the initiative, the tactical initiative, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3862.6200000000003s)]
*  now they wanted to get out there and retake the strategic initiative. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3869.6200000000003s)]
*  Regain control of the countryside and also to get a little bit of revenge. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3874.02s)]
*  They wanted to show the South Vietnamese and the American public that far from being a [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3877.54s)]
*  demonstration of communist strength, that this attack had just been another battle of [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3881.6600000000003s)]
*  the bulbs, a desperate last-ditch attempt where the communists just threw everything [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3886.74s)]
*  they had at the Americans and the South Vietnamese just to try to make something happen as their [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3890.4199999999996s)]
*  last bit of strength and morale faded. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3897.3399999999997s)]
*  That's what the Americans wanted to show, so they got out there and launched counter-offensives [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3899.3799999999997s)]
*  of our own all over the place. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3903.9799999999996s)]
*  So in February, Charlie Company is assigned a task force, Barker, collection of units [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3906.3399999999997s)]
*  thrown together whose mission would be to break down the communist infrastructure and [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3911.9399999999996s)]
*  reestablish dominance in Quang Ngai province. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3915.62s)]
*  Now, Quang Ngai wasn't just some random province, it was first of all in the northern part of [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3918.54s)]
*  South Vietnam near the demilitarized zone. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3923.98s)]
*  So it's up into a place where it's a lot of communist activity and on top of that, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3926.94s)]
*  Quang Ngai had a 300-year-old well-earned reputation for despising and resisting foreign [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3932.2200000000003s)]
*  occupiers, even more so than other regions in the country. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3938.7s)]
*  It was the home of the Viet Cong 48th Local Force Battalion, a battle-hardened force of [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3943.66s)]
*  tough veteran fighters who had been in the game since before the French had been driven [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3950.8999999999996s)]
*  out in 54. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3954.94s)]
*  One general mentioned that you'd find fathers, brothers, mothers, grandmothers, anybody with [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3957.7s)]
*  two good legs contributing to the resistance in one way or another. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3962.22s)]
*  Pinkville, a region in Quang Ngai, was marked as a high-density population area on the map, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3967.5s)]
*  but you might have been fooled if you were looking at it flying over it all from the air. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3973.46s)]
*  It didn't look so crowded, but underground was a different story. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3979.02s)]
*  From Howard Jones' book on Meli, he says, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3983.7s)]
*  Over the next several days, US forces began to grasp the enormity of their problem in [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3987.1s)]
*  Pinkville while exploring a large and intricate tunnel network connecting rooms 20 feet below [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3991.5s)]
*  the surface. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3996.58s)]
*  They discovered an entire underground medical dispensary. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=3998.62s)]
*  The enemy had bricked up the tunnels and rooms, creating a fully fortified subterranean headquarters. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4002.06s)]
*  It was clear that the Viet Cong's 48th Local Force Battalion had been there for many years [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4007.9s)]
*  and intended to stay many more. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4012.34s)]
*  Leading up to the operation, the Americans dropped leaflets informing the Vietnamese [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4017.34s)]
*  people of their two options, to either leave the area and live as Vietnamese nationals [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4022.18s)]
*  or stay where they were and die as Viet Cong sympathizers. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4029.2599999999998s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Americans failed to take into account that the vast majority of the [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4033.7s)]
*  Vietnamese peasants were illiterate so that they couldn't read those leaflets. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4038.8199999999997s)]
*  Nevertheless, the message, having been delivered, large portions of Quang Ngai province were [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4043.2599999999998s)]
*  designated free-fire zones, which meant that they were declared to be under VC control [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4049.14s)]
*  and that strategic bombing and artillery fire was permitted in and around the villages [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4054.7s)]
*  there. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4058.46s)]
*  So you've got to understand that Vietnam was not a war where the goal was to march on and [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4059.46s)]
*  seize the enemy capital. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4065.2999999999997s)]
*  It had been decided early on that marching on Hanoi might provoke the Chinese to enter [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4066.7799999999997s)]
*  the war in force, as they had in Korea, and that was not something that we wanted, so [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4071.98s)]
*  American leaders instead embarked on a war of attrition, with the straightforward goal [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4076.1s)]
*  of simply killing more enemy than the enemy could possibly replace, to force the enemy [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4081.02s)]
*  to understand that US firepower was simply too overwhelming and victory was just impossible [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4086.42s)]
*  and that they would just be forced to the table to negotiate a settlement. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4093.2599999999998s)]
*  That was the war plan, basically. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4099.46s)]
*  Kill them. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4101.14s)]
*  Kill. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4102.14s)]
*  Kill. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4103.14s)]
*  Kill. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4104.14s)]
*  American commanders at the time were very fond of quoting Mao's saying that, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4105.14s)]
*  The guerrillas are the fish, and the people are the sea, and instead of just chasing the [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4108.78s)]
*  fish around in their own habitat, our strategy was simply to drain the sea. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4115.219999999999s)]
*  So the attitude of the villagers that Charlie Company began to run into now was very different [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4121.62s)]
*  from the ones they were playing with on the beaches. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4127.139999999999s)]
*  The villagers they were running into now had been victims of American bombing and other [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4131.42s)]
*  offensive actions and they had a very different attitude. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4136.0599999999995s)]
*  Charlie Company had come to Vietnam hoping to be heroes and they expected to be greeted [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4139.86s)]
*  as liberators like their fathers had been in France, but the villagers they saw now [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4143.139999999999s)]
*  met them with suspicion verging on terror and barely concealed hostility and hatred. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4148.48s)]
*  After being assigned to Task Force Barker, Charlie Company starts pulling regular patrols [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4157.139999999999s)]
*  and almost immediately they start getting picked off. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4162.58s)]
*  I mean Vietnam, it's one of the things that I've, one of the things you pick up from watching [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4165.58s)]
*  movies and reading about it, but until you really dig into it, you just can't understand [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4174.46s)]
*  how awful it was to be in Vietnam. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4178.14s)]
*  Just as far as the way we fought the war. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4181.9s)]
*  It was a war like no other that Americans have fought. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4184.54s)]
*  It's a really terrifying kind of war that honestly I wouldn't want anything to do with. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4188.54s)]
*  You know again, remember we're not trying to seize territory or capture cities or railroad [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4192.22s)]
*  stations or anything like that. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4198.66s)]
*  We are trying to kill as many enemies as possible until they run out of fighters and are forced [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4200.1s)]
*  to negotiate. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4205.22s)]
*  So the job of your typical Army grunt was to put it very simply to go walking through [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4207.38s)]
*  a jungle filled with mines and booby traps and snipers and ambushes until they find the [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4213.34s)]
*  enemy or the enemy finds them. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4218.9800000000005s)]
*  And when they find each other, go get them. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4221.3s)]
*  There are no battle lines. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4225.14s)]
*  The enemy is everywhere and nowhere. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4227.02s)]
*  You might be walking through the forest hacking through thick foliage fearing with every step [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4230.68s)]
*  you take that you'd be the one to lose a foot or set off a booby trap this time. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4237.96s)]
*  And it's just a roll of the dice. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4245.5s)]
*  You're walking through, hacking through the jungle, hoping you don't step on a mine or [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4248.88s)]
*  set off a booby trap. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4253.4800000000005s)]
*  Suddenly the enemy announces himself when the belly of the man next to you blows out [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4254.4800000000005s)]
*  through his back from the force of a sniper bullet and he hits the ground. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4257.92s)]
*  And you all drop and take cover trying to get your bearings and even figure out where [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4262.740000000001s)]
*  the shot came from because you can't tell. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4266.88s)]
*  When you hear another one, it drops another man that you've been training and drinking [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4270.36s)]
*  and joking with and trading stories with for the last year and now he drops. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4273.64s)]
*  So you start spraying suppressive fire in the direction of the shot, at least you think [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4279.88s)]
*  the direction of the shot and you start to get each other together to try to prepare [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4284.92s)]
*  to assault the enemy position but as soon as you move forward someone steps on a mine. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4288.96s)]
*  Boom! [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4294.52s)]
*  By the time you finally make your way over to where the shots had come from, the enemy's [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4295.52s)]
*  long gone, melted away into the jungle. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4299.96s)]
*  It's like fighting ghosts. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4303.56s)]
*  It's stressful, incredibly frustrating. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4305.8s)]
*  Never getting your hands on the people that every day are killing and maiming your friends. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4309.6s)]
*  Never even seeing them. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4314.96s)]
*  Soldiers from Charlie Company, and you hear this from other Vietnam vets as well, they [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4317.92s)]
*  talk about how in the middle of taking sniper fire sometimes they would get so just crazy [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4321.64s)]
*  with frustration and stress that they would jump up and expose themselves and start screaming [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4328.52s)]
*  at the enemy who was hiding out there to come out and fight, come out and fight. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4333.4400000000005s)]
*  And they talk about how they would imagine that the enemy was out there in the bush just [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4338.04s)]
*  laughing at you, looking around terrified and shooting in the wrong direction and screaming [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4341.400000000001s)]
*  at the air like a crazy person. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4345.52s)]
*  The first man killed in Charlie Company was a popular young soldier named Bill Weber, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4350.04s)]
*  dropped by a sniper after Lieutenant Callie had quite foolishly ordered his men to ford [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4355.12s)]
*  a river out into open ground. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4360.12s)]
*  He didn't die easy, he died very very hard, and the men blamed Callie for it, and it was [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4362.8s)]
*  probably Callie's fault. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4367.68s)]
*  Those type of things happen in war, you have to move past it, but it was a pattern with him. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4370.68s)]
*  For weeks this is how it went. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4377.4s)]
*  The men picked off in ones and twos, never laying eyes on the 48th VC battalion that [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4380.0s)]
*  they knew was out there somewhere. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4384.96s)]
*  And men, not everybody, but I think as a general rule, men seem to be able to, I don't mean [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4388.92s)]
*  men as opposed to women, I mean people, but seem to be able to, people kind, seem to be [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4395.76s)]
*  able to handle acute pressure, you know, just sharp acute pressure, there's something happening [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4402.56s)]
*  right now, you've got to deal with it. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4408.32s)]
*  A lot of people seem to be able to actually handle themselves fairly well in those cases. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4410.12s)]
*  People that you wouldn't expect often respond admirably when everything is put on the line. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4415.5599999999995s)]
*  But this is different, this is that ambient danger that's just always there, chronic stress [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4422.679999999999s)]
*  from playing sniper roulette every day, having to worry every time you set your foot down [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4430.4s)]
*  if this would be the step that kills you, or if this would be the step that kills you, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4436.48s)]
*  or this one. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4441.16s)]
*  You know, we don't know what it's like to have to be consciously aware of, to think [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4442.16s)]
*  consciously about whether the spot we're about to sit down is safe, and then, is it safe? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4450.96s)]
*  It's safe. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4457.0s)]
*  And once we've sat down we've got to put our feet somewhere, and should I put my feet there [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4459.599999999999s)]
*  or over there, because choosing wrong, that might be it, that might be the end, because [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4464.72s)]
*  you've seen it be the end for people that you loved and cared about many times. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4469.0s)]
*  You know, I got to thinking about how one of the differences between a pet and a wild [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4475.6s)]
*  animal, or a person and a wild animal, is that a wild animal never really feels safe, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4480.92s)]
*  not once it's full grown and responsible for itself. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4489.320000000001s)]
*  It can feel more or less safe, but it never feels secure, like really secure. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4493.08s)]
*  When we sit down in our living room, we're safe enough that we really don't think about [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4497.64s)]
*  it. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4503.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, if you live in America and most places and you have a normal life, you don't think [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4504.5199999999995s)]
*  about it. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4508.0s)]
*  And if you don't feel safe under circumstances like that sitting in your living room, you [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4509.0s)]
*  know, you've either got a problem, or we refer you to a psychologist so that you can overcome [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4513.92s)]
*  that feeling, right? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4519.76s)]
*  We consider it pathological. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4520.92s)]
*  If your life really is such that you can't feel safe in your living room, you know, you [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4523.4800000000005s)]
*  can't sustain yourself that way for very long before you start to behave very strangely. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4528.28s)]
*  But if you take like a, you know, a mother fox in her den with her pups, and her den [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4535.72s)]
*  is her home, that's the safest place that she's ever going to be, but there's no safety [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4541.12s)]
*  there. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4546.4800000000005s)]
*  There are things out there looking for her, always. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4548.540000000001s)]
*  And if one of them comes through that hole into her den, that is it. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4552.8s)]
*  It's over. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4556.38s)]
*  And so wild animals can't relax. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4557.38s)]
*  Not really. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4561.02s)]
*  And neither can gorilla fighters. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4562.02s)]
*  It's always just a matter of chance that the people looking for you see you before you [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4564.18s)]
*  see them. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4568.26s)]
*  And this kind of chronic ambient background stress over a long enough period of time, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4570.780000000001s)]
*  it has a way of turning men into something more like animals. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4577.22s)]
*  You know, jumpy, reactive, aggressive, and violent sometimes. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4580.14s)]
*  The environment in Vietnam took its toll on the men physically and psychologically. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4590.3s)]
*  A quote from veteran Philip Caputo's great book, A Rumor of War, is embedded in this [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4596.860000000001s)]
*  larger quote by author Howard Jones. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4603.22s)]
*  War can arouse a psychopathic violence in men of seemingly normal impulses, but the [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4606.860000000001s)]
*  type of war waged in Vietnam deteriorated into an absolute savagery that was unlike [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4612.66s)]
*  any other conflict. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4617.26s)]
*  American lives were at stake in an environment where he could not be sure who or where the [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4620.06s)]
*  enemy was. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4624.62s)]
*  Fighting an Indian country, Indian country is another name U.S. troops called V.C. controlled [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4626.9800000000005s)]
*  territory. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4631.46s)]
*  Fighting an Indian country with no battle lines against a ghost-like guerrilla army [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4632.94s)]
*  with no uniforms that hid among the populace and employed a labyrinth of jungle trails [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4636.84s)]
*  and tunnels unnerved American soldiers. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4641.28s)]
*  Anyone Vietnamese was responsible for their plight, or so they came to believe during [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4645.38s)]
*  endless hours in the heat, humidity, and incessant pounding rain of the monsoon season. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4649.36s)]
*  The dry season was no better. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4655.52s)]
*  Strong patrols trudging forward with heavy backpacks that tugged in the opposite direction [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4657.7s)]
*  while worrying whether their M16 assault rifles, which frequently malfunctioned, would work [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4662.54s)]
*  at crunch time. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4667.66s)]
*  And all this in temperatures that soared to 100 degrees in humidity that trailed not far [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4671.3s)]
*  behind. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4675.78s)]
*  Sweat-drenched clothing, sweat bands on foreheads pressing forward through clouds of dust or [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4678.0599999999995s)]
*  growing high grass, or hacking through the bush with its towering bamboo and banana trees. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4683.24s)]
*  Wire-like wait-a-minute vines and razor-sharp elephant grass that could rise up 15 feet [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4689.5199999999995s)]
*  in height. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4694.04s)]
*  No one could see more than three feet ahead. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4695.84s)]
*  In Vietnam, misery came in many forms for soldiers like Cali and Medina. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4698.639999999999s)]
*  Whether during the advance or waiting in ambush in foxholes or brush, they fought a relentless [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4703.96s)]
*  war against flies, mosquitoes, fire ants, spiders, chiggers, centipedes, leeches, ticks, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4709.46s)]
*  honeybees, rats, snakes, and every other pest of nature that walked, crawled, or flew. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4715.3s)]
*  The monsoon season brought some relief from the stifling heat, but that was of little [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4722.660000000001s)]
*  consolation to soldiers slogging through the mud and muck while being hammered by the monotonous [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4726.780000000001s)]
*  and seemingly unending rain. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4731.14s)]
*  The [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4734.66s)]
*  one day on a routine patrol, Charlie Company walked into a minefield. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4753.34s)]
*  They only discovered when somebody stepped on one. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4758.82s)]
*  It turned out that the whole area was filled with mines, and as soon as the first one blew, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4762.42s)]
*  someone else seemed to blow up every time they took a step. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4767.34s)]
*  But you're out in the open, right? [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4771.24s)]
*  And your friends are dying, so you can't just lie there and not move. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4774.12s)]
*  And the men of Charlie Company, they were a solid unit, and they cared about each other. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4777.8s)]
*  So they were jumping up and running to help their wounded friends, and then BOOM, another [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4781.38s)]
*  man sent flying in one direction. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4784.88s)]
*  His leg flies in the other direction. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4786.6s)]
*  Someone jumps up and goes to help him, BOOM, another man down. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4788.84s)]
*  People are screaming and calling out, MADIC, MADIC! [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4793.04s)]
*  One soldier, Bobby Wilson, and it's just awful. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4796.360000000001s)]
*  You look at pictures of this kid, and he looks like a baby. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4799.14s)]
*  I mean, he looks like a sandy-haired child. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4801.9800000000005s)]
*  Bobby Wilson trips a bouncing Betty, which is a device that shoots up its ordinance about [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4805.74s)]
*  three feet in the air before it explodes. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4811.58s)]
*  Medina sees him hit by this bouncing Betty, and he just goes charging across the field. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4814.5s)]
*  The men say that he's just completely oblivious to the danger, totally fearless, running across [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4818.7s)]
*  the field, shouting orders at his men as he's making his way to what's left of Bobby Wilson. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4824.78s)]
*  Later on, Medina described how he found Wilson. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4830.86s)]
*  He said, quote, he was split as if somebody had taken a cleaver right up from his crotch [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4833.0s)]
*  to his chest cavity. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4839.9s)]
*  I've never seen anything so unreal in my entire life. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4841.8s)]
*  We took a poncho, spread it out. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4847.04s)]
*  The medic started to pick him up under his legs. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4849.96s)]
*  I reached under his arms, placed him onto the poncho, and we'd set him on top of another [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4853.12s)]
*  mine, end quote. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4859.24s)]
*  And Bobby Wilson's body just flew apart, knocking back Medina and the medic and covering them [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4861.56s)]
*  in the young soldier's gore. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4867.14s)]
*  When finally the field is cleared, Charlie Company had suffered over two dozen casualties, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4870.88s)]
*  and they still had not made contact with an enemy that they could fight. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4876.92s)]
*  After that day in the minefield, Charlie Company changed. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4883.22s)]
*  A dark, dark mood came over this group of young men who a month or two ago had, you [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4885.96s)]
*  know, they were having fun handing out candy to children in the villages they visited. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4893.88s)]
*  Not anymore. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4900.64s)]
*  See the villagers knew where these mines were. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4902.9400000000005s)]
*  They knew where the booby traps were. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4906.28s)]
*  Charlie Company knew that they knew because the villagers were never blown up by them [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4909.24s)]
*  in all those hours and days that they'd be walking through those same jungles and working [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4912.5599999999995s)]
*  in those same fields where American soldiers were dying every day. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4917.139999999999s)]
*  And sometimes they also knew the villagers were the ones planting them, including the [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4922.759999999999s)]
*  women and even the children. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4928.04s)]
*  And so now when the men would come through a village, they weren't handing out candy [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4931.28s)]
*  to the kids. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4935.92s)]
*  What was that look that woman just gave you? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4938.44s)]
*  Did you just imagine that or was it a smirk? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4941.759999999999s)]
*  Was it a smirk because she knew where that mine was that blew up your buddy this morning? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4943.5199999999995s)]
*  Maybe she was the one that put it there. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4949.36s)]
*  Maybe I didn't see a look at all, but wait, maybe I did. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4952.4s)]
*  You know, this is what happens. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4956.44s)]
*  This is unfortunately how insurgent wars tend to go. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4959.58s)]
*  Wars where a regular military can't tell the difference between enemy and civilian and [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4965.22s)]
*  often the civilians are the only people around on whom they can vent their frustrations and [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4969.82s)]
*  fears. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4973.98s)]
*  It's very difficult to win these wars. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4976.74s)]
*  In the modern era it's damn near impossible because the commanders and the political leaders [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4978.58s)]
*  have very different needs than the men on the ground do. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4984.3s)]
*  The man needs to win hearts and minds of the local population, but the soldiers on some [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4988.66s)]
*  level need the people to fear them. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4993.74s)]
*  When you walk into a village in the morning, you want the people to know that if I lose [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=4999.18s)]
*  another one of my friends to a landmine as soon as I step outside this village, I'm going [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5005.46s)]
*  to be back here and that's going to be bad, bad news for you. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5010.98s)]
*  So the next time a group of VC fighters shows up in the evening wanting to use your village [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5017.5s)]
*  for an overnight stay, you might want to think long and hard about who you fear more. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5021.5s)]
*  And now, this is me talking, I'm not justifying this, I'm just telling you how it is. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5027.66s)]
*  And this is why discipline is absolutely the most important thing in war, especially in [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5033.5s)]
*  an insurgency, for a regular military in an insurgency. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5040.7s)]
*  Not morality, you know, not doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5045.56s)]
*  Forget about that, it's a bad joke in a place where bombers are incinerating whole forests [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5049.68s)]
*  just to deprive an enemy militia of a place to hide or where people are digging pits full [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5056.18s)]
*  of sharp sticks for you and your friends to fall into and get impaled on. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5060.68s)]
*  Okay, there's no morality or immorality here. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5064.56s)]
*  There's discipline and indiscipline. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5068.6s)]
*  And if you're weeks and months of experiences like the one in the minefield, maybe you're [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5073.06s)]
*  still not the type who would abuse a civilian, but maybe you're just a little bit less likely [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5079.42s)]
*  to stop the guy who is. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5085.06s)]
*  And that's all it takes, that's how it starts. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5087.1s)]
*  And that's why discipline is everything. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5090.200000000001s)]
*  You know, men in war are so revved up and on the edge that they have to be able to look, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5092.42s)]
*  you can't trust your own. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5100.38s)]
*  It's not entirely true. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5104.92s)]
*  There's some men who are able to stay centered, but in general these men, especially young [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5106.08s)]
*  men, they've got to be able to look to their officers and their NCOs for where the boundaries [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5111.1s)]
*  are because by the very nature of what you're being asked to go over there and do, you're [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5115.1s)]
*  being asked to do things that are completely outside the moral universe that you've lived [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5121.18s)]
*  in your entire life. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5125.16s)]
*  And so when those boundaries aren't set up and enforced, that's when savagery takes over. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5128.58s)]
*  From a book by author Nick Terce called Kill Anything That Moves, quote, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5136.96s)]
*  As the days went on, this is after the minefield incident, as the days went on, the situation [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5142.66s)]
*  in Charlie Company continued to degenerate. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5150.66s)]
*  As one soldier put it, first you'd stop the people, question them, and let them go. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5154.92s)]
*  Second, you'd stop the people, beat up an old man, and let them go. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5161.0s)]
*  Third, you'd stop the people, beat up an old man, and then shoot him. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5166.04s)]
*  Fourth, you go and wipe out a village. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5170.52s)]
*  On March 14th, 1968, after a booby trap killed one soldier and severely wounded two others, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5174.16s)]
*  members of the unit went on a rampage through several hamlets. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5180.68s)]
*  They beat up a villager on a bicycle, assaulted children, and set upon an unarmed woman. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5184.04s)]
*  In a letter home to his parents, a soldier in Charlie Company describes it, quote, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5189.96s)]
*  Dear Dad, how's everything with you? [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5197.44s)]
*  One of our platoons went on a routine patrol today and came across a 155-millimeter round [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5200.98s)]
*  that was booby-trapped. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5205.4s)]
*  It killed one man, blew the legs off two others, and injured two more. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5207.64s)]
*  On their way back to the LZ, they saw a woman working in the fields. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5214.0599999999995s)]
*  They shot and wounded her. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5219.34s)]
*  Then they kicked her to death and emptied their magazines into her head. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5221.54s)]
*  It was murder. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5226.26s)]
*  I'm ashamed of myself for not trying to do something about it. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5227.26s)]
*  It's not the first time, Dad. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5231.7s)]
*  I've seen it many times before. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5233.9s)]
*  My faith in my fellow man is all shot to hell. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5236.94s)]
*  I just want the time to pass, and I just want to come home. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5240.62s)]
*  Saturday we're being dropped in by air to an NBA stronghold. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5245.74s)]
*  Don't expect any letters for a while. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5250.34s)]
*  Please keep writing them. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5252.9s)]
*  I love and miss you and Mom, end quote. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5254.62s)]
*  The stronghold that soldier was about to be dropped into was just outside the Somme village [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5259.0599999999995s)]
*  in the area called Pinkville, and his platoon was set to assault a hamlet known to the Americans [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5264.78s)]

*  The evening before the assault, the men of Charlie Company are very keyed up. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5274.86s)]
*  They are wound up. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5282.9800000000005s)]
*  They're frightened because they were told that they'd be facing 200 to over 400 hardened [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5284.46s)]
*  enemy from the VC Local 48th Battalion. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5291.26s)]
*  They're excited because they're finally getting the drop on the Vietnamese that they've been [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5294.82s)]
*  chasing all over Quang Ngai province this whole time. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5299.14s)]
*  They've been watching their friends bleed out for months, and they're finally going [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5302.5s)]
*  to get their hands on the men responsible for it. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5306.700000000001s)]
*  They also just wanted to prove themselves. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5311.5s)]
*  Remember, these are young men. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5313.620000000001s)]
*  Many of them very young. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5315.54s)]
*  These kids are 18 to 22 years old. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5317.42s)]
*  Many of them are just out of high school. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5320.38s)]
*  This will be their first combat encounter and their first chance to really engage the [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5321.5s)]
*  enemy to fight. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5325.9800000000005s)]
*  Like most young men, behind the layers of fear and duty and aggression, there's just [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5329.14s)]
*  a basic ache to prove yourself. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5333.74s)]
*  They wanted to prove themselves as a unit as well. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5335.94s)]
*  Try to imagine it. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5343.98s)]
*  You just put yourself in their position, months of dead friends and the enemy slipping away. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5344.98s)]
*  Now the next morning, you'd be taken in by Hilo to a landing zone just outside a village, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5350.54s)]
*  and it was time to show the Viet Cong that the men they'd been killing had friends, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5355.26s)]
*  and now their friends were here for revenge. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5359.66s)]
*  There's a strong element of honor even in vengeance. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5363.900000000001s)]
*  The duty that you have to people you love to ensure that their killers or people who [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5368.280000000001s)]
*  hurt them, they don't get to walk away free as if they killed an insect or a dog or a [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5373.62s)]
*  human with no friends or family. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5378.9400000000005s)]
*  Not this time, not with Charlie Company. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5382.62s)]
*  The Viet Cong were about to find out just exactly who it was they'd been killing. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5385.5s)]
*  They were to be dropped in first thing the next morning. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5390.7s)]
*  According to military intelligence, it's a market day, mentioned that before, so all [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5395.74s)]
*  the civilians will have left the area. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5398.94s)]
*  The Hamlets themselves were declared free fire zones. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5401.82s)]
*  Anyone still present, they were told, is an enemy. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5407.34s)]
*  Charlie's first platoon was to organize quickly and make an immediate assault straight through [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5411.62s)]
*  the first Hamlet, coming from west to east, straight through the middle. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5415.0599999999995s)]
*  Second platoon would come in just behind them, coming in through the northwest to mop up [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5420.3s)]
*  a little bit, followed by Medina rolling in with third platoon, his force coming in through [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5424.42s)]
*  the southwest, all of them pushing east, east, east. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5428.46s)]
*  Medina wants his men in an assault mentality. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5432.58s)]
*  They're not going there to fight, they're going there to assault this enemy. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5437.46s)]
*  Colonel Orrin Henderson, the brand new commander of 11th Brigade, preparing for his first combat [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5441.22s)]
*  mission in that role, he emphasized Medina. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5445.46s)]
*  He wanted to see Charlie Company, quote, go in there aggressively, close with the enemy, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5448.02s)]
*  and wipe them out for good. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5452.42s)]
*  A message that Medina amplified and conveyed to his own men. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5455.06s)]
*  Medina wants them in a mindset where if they hear a sound off to one side, they're not [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5460.66s)]
*  jumping to take cover. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5464.38s)]
*  They're looking for the source of the sound so they can kill it. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5466.38s)]
*  The VC unit they'd be fighting had been around a long time, and they were absolutely no joke. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5470.9s)]
*  Okay, if the American tactics are effective, the VC will have to stand and fight, and everybody [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5476.179999999999s)]
*  expects a mini Stalingrad out there in the jungle. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5483.179999999999s)]
*  The riflemen are ordered to pack a triple basic load, dropping unnecessary weight to [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5487.0199999999995s)]
*  make room for 540 rounds of ammunition instead of the usual 180. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5490.94s)]
*  Now everybody knows that there may be a few civilian stragglers, a few people who didn't [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5495.54s)]
*  leave the village, but Medina doesn't want his inexperienced men cluttering up their [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5500.86s)]
*  minds worrying about that. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5505.86s)]
*  This is their first time going into combat, and they're about to have a big, big, big fight. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5508.38s)]
*  Moreover, they've got to move fast, extremely fast, or else that 48th Battalion will just [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5514.54s)]
*  melt away into the jungle the way they always have. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5519.62s)]
*  And they're not going to have the element of surprise either, because right beforehand [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5523.5s)]
*  they're going to be getting lit up with Huey gunships and artillery. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5526.74s)]
*  And more than anything, more than anything, Medina said, no matter what, they were told [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5532.86s)]
*  they just must not allow anyone to get behind them. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5537.219999999999s)]
*  Alpha and Bravo Company had gotten into a situation where they allowed the enemy to [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5541.219999999999s)]
*  fan out and get behind them a bit, and they suffered a lot of casualties back in February. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5545.24s)]
*  They were not to let that happen. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5549.639999999999s)]
*  If they ended up crowded together in the village, taking fire from multiple directions in the [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5552.18s)]
*  jungle roundabout, it could get really ugly really fast. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5557.22s)]
*  So the rules are move fast, do not allow yourself to be held up, and do not let anything get [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5559.9400000000005s)]
*  behind you. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5565.34s)]
*  They are not there to fight, they are there to assault this village and destroy this enemy, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5566.34s)]
*  to destroy everything, to burn down the huts, destroy the food, contaminate the wells, and [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5572.1s)]
*  shoot the livestock, both to deny the enemy their future use and to send a message about [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5577.7s)]
*  what happens when you shelter Viet Cong or mess with Charlie Company. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5582.82s)]
*  Answering questions about the rules of engagement in this free fire zone, Medina gave his men [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5589.78s)]
*  a simple injunction, kill everything that moves. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5594.32s)]
*  But there was one problem. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5599.42s)]
*  The Viet Cong 48th Local Battalion was nowhere near the village Charlie Company is about [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5605.3s)]
*  to assault. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5611.1s)]
*  They are 150 miles away in the western part of the province. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5612.1s)]
*  In fact, there are no combatants in the village at all. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5617.14s)]
*  The next morning, just about 100 men from Charlie Company are on helos being ferried [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5623.18s)]
*  to the LZ in three groups about 100 to 200 yards to the west of the village. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5629.06s)]
*  On the way in, a few helos report taking AK fire from the jungle to the south of the village, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5635.700000000001s)]
*  and that goes out of the radio, so the men are told that they will be jumping off the [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5641.42s)]
*  helos into a hot LZ, meaning they will be taking fire as they are getting out of the [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5645.02s)]
*  helicopters. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5648.9800000000005s)]
*  The first group of helos carrying Cali's first platoon approaches the landing zone, already [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5651.22s)]
*  laying down heavy machine gun fire to try to suppress the enemy. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5655.34s)]
*  It's really, really loud and very disorienting, and so as the men are jumping out of the helicopters, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5659.22s)]
*  it's really hard to tell where the fire is coming from. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5663.62s)]
*  You can imagine a bunch of mounted machine guns going off right next to you. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5666.54s)]
*  It's just loud, that's all they know. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5670.22s)]
*  So they start laying down fire of their own into the village about 200 yards out. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5672.18s)]
*  They start to see movement and they shoot at it. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5677.34s)]
*  They got to move fast, they got to go right now. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5680.14s)]
*  The other helos are coming in behind them and they cannot afford to get pinned down [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5682.18s)]
*  out in the open, taking fire from an enemy concealed by the village or the jungle. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5685.42s)]
*  The men are shouting and getting themselves organized, go, go, go, get on the line, let's [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5691.780000000001s)]
*  get moving. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5695.5s)]
*  As they begin to push into the village, civilians start to come out of their houses to see what's [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5696.5s)]
*  going on. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5700.34s)]
*  Some of them are showing the Americans their empty hands and repeating the one phrase of [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5702.52s)]
*  English that experience has forced them to memorize, no VC, no VC. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5707.1s)]
*  And others are just wandering out in their early morning pajamas to see what the fuss [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5712.14s)]
*  is about. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5715.46s)]
*  American soldiers had come through before plenty of times and the Vietnamese didn't [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5717.860000000001s)]
*  seem to expect trouble despite the earlier gunfire. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5722.04s)]
*  So the Americans start to slow down. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5726.58s)]
*  First platoon looks around a little bit, there's a pause, maybe a momentary stillness as these [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5730.18s)]
*  young American boys, many of whom had never left their home state before the army, look [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5735.02s)]
*  at the guns they're holding in their hands 10,000 miles away from home and they look [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5741.4s)]
*  at each other and at the Vietnamese and the Vietnamese look at them. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5745.28s)]
*  And for some reason, I've become fascinated with this pause, with this moment. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5748.839999999999s)]
*  It only lasts a few seconds, but I always imagine the men, yeah, it only lasts a few [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5754.759999999999s)]
*  seconds but like I always imagine the men stuck there for the rest of their lives, you [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5762.16s)]
*  know, unable to ever stop thinking or dreaming about those few seconds before everything [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5769.0s)]
*  that made them human fell apart. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5773.16s)]
*  That pause is shattered when a few of the crazy guys in the platoon, every unit has [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5777.44s)]
*  them, you know, a certain percentage of the male population are clinical psychopaths and [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5782.56s)]
*  they can be very effective soldiers if they're well managed and held to discipline but that [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5787.76s)]
*  is not the case here. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5792.32s)]
*  So a few soldiers said, hey, they said it was a free fire zone. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5793.4s)]
*  It's rock and roll, baby. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5798.5199999999995s)]
*  And they just start gunning down these Vietnamese civilians. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5800.32s)]
*  And with that, it just spun out of control. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5803.32s)]
*  Everything broke down. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5807.759999999999s)]
*  I've tried to understand what that means. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5810.12s)]
*  I've tried hard enough that I'll be honest, well, it just hasn't been fun. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5811.799999999999s)]
*  Like I said, it's done a little damage. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5816.719999999999s)]
*  I've gone to some pretty dark places trying to understand how a young guy who loved his [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5821.44s)]
*  family and was kind to people at home and had never been in trouble or ever inclined [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5826.24s)]
*  to violence, how he responds to the first few murders by raising his own gun and shooting [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5831.16s)]
*  an old man in the face. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5837.16s)]
*  You know, it's just it's not possible that we happen to gather up a bunch of psychopaths [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5842.08s)]
*  and put them all in one unit. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5846.76s)]
*  These were normal men. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5849.2s)]
*  You read about it and you listen to them and there can just be no doubt about it. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5851.8s)]
*  They were they were you and me. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5856.76s)]
*  If you say you would never do anything like this, the answer is not yes, you would. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5859.88s)]
*  The answer is neither would they. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5864.64s)]
*  So I try to put myself there and puzzle it out. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5869.52s)]
*  And you know, so I'm, you know, I'm in that place. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5873.360000000001s)]
*  I'm one of these men, my friends, people I know well, I look around, people that have [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5879.04s)]
*  risked their lives for me. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5884.44s)]
*  I'm watching them shoot these people, shooting women and children. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5886.44s)]
*  And so I asked myself, if I was there and I wanted to stop it all, what would I do? [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5892.08s)]
*  How would I do it? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5897.36s)]
*  There's no one to report it to. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5898.36s)]
*  The NCOs and the officers are all shooting too. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5900.6s)]
*  Do we want to get into the complications of trying to confront a man armed with an automatic [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5905.4800000000005s)]
*  weapon that you just saw gunned down a mother holding her infant and then stomp on the infant [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5911.2s)]
*  to kill it? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5916.56s)]
*  Do I shoot him? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5919.08s)]
*  Do I shoot this American soldier? [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5920.08s)]
*  Do I shoot everybody in the platoon? [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5923.6s)]
*  There are three dozen guys there. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5927.52s)]
*  And then what? [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5930.24s)]
*  I mean, and remember, you just got here. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5932.2s)]
*  You don't know that the enemy is completely out of the area. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5934.88s)]
*  They haven't figured that out yet. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5937.12s)]
*  So the enemy could be up ahead hiding in the next part of the village or in the houses [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5938.36s)]
*  around you getting in position to open up as you're sitting there trying to figure out [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5941.5599999999995s)]
*  what to do. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5945.4s)]
*  And Medina is on the radio screaming at you guys to get moving. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5946.4s)]
*  You know, do you run away and refuse to be a part of all this? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5950.44s)]
*  You coward. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5954.04s)]
*  Is that what you do? [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5955.04s)]
*  You coward. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5956.04s)]
*  You know, I mean, these are the thoughts that I imagine run through people's heads, some [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5958.6s)]
*  of their heads at least. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5962.84s)]
*  You know, while you're standing there trying to get a grip, you've watched a dozen of your [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5964.92s)]
*  buddies shoot people and now it's done. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5968.400000000001s)]
*  You know, and again, it's probably not even like all this is actually going through your [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5971.92s)]
*  head. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5975.64s)]
*  It's too overwhelming and happening too fast. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5976.64s)]
*  And pretty soon you start to realize that you're one of the only people who hasn't [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5978.360000000001s)]
*  fired his weapon. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5981.64s)]
*  And do you really want to have the only clean hands in a unit full of murderers? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5984.2s)]
*  You know, it's not like a group of child murderers is going to hesitate to get rid of the one [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5990.679999999999s)]
*  person that they have to worry about telling what they've done. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5994.96s)]
*  And it's loud and insane and you have to move fast and not get stalled out and under no [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=5999.5199999999995s)]
*  circumstances can you let anybody get behind you. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6004.599999999999s)]
*  So maybe you raise your weapon and you fire. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6007.16s)]
*  And then the man next to you with doubts of his own runs through that same process [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6010.72s)]
*  that I just described, only now you're the one shooting a family and he's worried about [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6015.7s)]
*  you thinking that he's suspicious for not having fired his weapon yet. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6020.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6025.68s)]
*  I don't know how this goes down. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6026.68s)]
*  I really don't. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6027.68s)]
*  But what I do know is I can't let myself off the hook by imagining that these were men [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6029.16s)]
*  of a different substance than me because it's just not true. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6034.02s)]
*  This is not. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6037.92s)]
*  I mean, I've spent the last weeks trying to put myself in that place and not as the heroic [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6039.12s)]
*  dissident, not imagining that I would have been there opposed, you know, just completely [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6044.76s)]
*  appalled at the whole thing and wanting to stop. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6051.0s)]
*  But trying to be one of the average soldiers there, just another guy who raises my rifle [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6053.52s)]
*  and puts a bullet through the head of someone's grandmother. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6059.64s)]
*  And for weeks I've been doing this, you know. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6064.12s)]
*  And to be honest, I don't feel like I have gained anything from it at all. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6067.32s)]
*  I don't think I understand myself better. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6071.32s)]
*  I don't feel like I understand other people better. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6073.24s)]
*  I don't feel like I've gained anything from it. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6076.08s)]
*  I really just feel like shit from it, to be honest with you. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6077.84s)]
*  You know, and mainly that's because every time I push it far enough, I find myself feeling [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6081.88s)]
*  compassion for a bunch of men who mercilessly slaughtered almost 500 innocent people. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6088.32s)]
*  And compassion is the last thing that I want to feel about any of this. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6093.64s)]
*  One Vietnamese survivor who was a child at the time remembered that day, quote, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6100.200000000001s)]
*  Around 833 American soldiers came to my house. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6104.64s)]
*  They pushed six of us down into the shelter and threw a hand grenade in behind us. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6109.320000000001s)]
*  And then they used their machine guns to shoot us down. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6114.08s)]
*  My entire family was blown into pieces. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6117.280000000001s)]
*  And the only person left alive was me. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6120.28s)]
*  And another survivor remembered, quote, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6124.759999999999s)]
*  Suddenly an American soldier came in carrying a gun. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6128.24s)]
*  I saw my father collapse. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6131.28s)]
*  And then my mother, my grandfather, and my grandmother, they all continued to fall. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6133.32s)]
*  My brother, younger than me, only three years old, suddenly they blasted his head open. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6139.5599999999995s)]
*  One shot and his head blasted onto the floor, end quote. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6145.4s)]
*  An Army photographer, I think his name's Haverly, Ronald Haverly, photographer attached to Charlie [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6150.879999999999s)]
*  Company. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6159.639999999999s)]
*  He followed the initial assault into the village. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6160.639999999999s)]
*  So it's one of the crazy things back then is you don't see a lot of nasty footage coming [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6162.32s)]
*  out of the Iraq or Afghanistan wars these days. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6168.92s)]
*  You don't see stuff like the little girl running naked from the napalm attack in Vietnam or [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6172.28s)]
*  the famous photo of the South Vietnamese official putting the pistol to the North Vietnamese [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6178.8s)]
*  soldier's head. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6185.0s)]
*  You don't get that often. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6186.8s)]
*  But back then we had Army photographers at Meli. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6187.96s)]
*  We sent Army reporters with them. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6192.24s)]
*  It's very different today. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6195.84s)]
*  The Army photographer attached to Charlie Company is following the initial assault into [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6198.84s)]
*  the village, taking pictures of everything he sees, just probably using his camera as [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6204.32s)]
*  a shield a little bit to kind of separate himself from everything that's going on maybe. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6210.04s)]
*  And he comes in and he approaches a group of Vietnamese women and children that are [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6215.24s)]
*  huddled together with several American soldiers standing around them. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6219.84s)]
*  If you're not driving at the moment, I know a lot of people listen while they're driving, [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6224.72s)]
*  but if you're not, and don't do it if you are, if you're not driving, go to Google and [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6229.4400000000005s)]
*  search for Meli massacre woman in red and go look at the images. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6234.66s)]
*  The first few images that come up will show you the picture that he took. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6241.0s)]
*  It's not gory or anything. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6248.8s)]
*  They're all alive. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6249.8s)]
*  They're standing up. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6250.8s)]
*  That's a middle-aged woman, just a tiny little thing in a red top and a black skirt. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6251.92s)]
*  And she's standing in front of several other women and children kind of trying to protect [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6258.0s)]
*  them. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6262.84s)]
*  And she is just absolutely terrified. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6264.2s)]
*  I've been staring at this picture and the look on her face is just burned into my brain [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6271.12s)]
*  at this point. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6275.4800000000005s)]
*  It's just, it's so awful. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6276.4800000000005s)]
*  She's standing in front of the rest of the group between them and the Americans doing [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6279.400000000001s)]
*  whatever pointless thing she can to protect them. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6283.4400000000005s)]
*  And a younger, taller woman is behind her with her arms around the first woman's waist [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6287.320000000001s)]
*  and her head buried into her shoulder. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6293.320000000001s)]
*  And then there are a few other people behind them and one of them off to the left. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6296.040000000001s)]
*  And I mean it. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6300.68s)]
*  If you can, go look up the picture. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6301.68s)]
*  Eli Massacre, Woman in Red, and just look at the first few images. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6303.88s)]
*  There are plenty of pictures of the torn up dead bodies and stuff, but this one, it just [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6308.64s)]
*  affects me. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6313.4400000000005s)]
*  Behind the two women I just mentioned, to the left of the picture is a little girl, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6314.4400000000005s)]
*  maybe five years old, in a white top and a black skirt. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6320.24s)]
*  And look at her face. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6323.8s)]
*  She's got the look on her face you would expect a five-year-old girl to have when a bunch [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6325.92s)]
*  of men show up to her village and start gunning everybody that she knows down in the streets [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6332.2s)]
*  and are now surrounding her and her family. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6338.92s)]
*  That's the look she has on her face. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6342.4s)]
*  And whatever you're picturing in your mind, it doesn't do it justice. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6344.08s)]
*  And so the photographer, Haverly, approaches this group and one of the men calls out that [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6348.72s)]
*  a photographer is coming, so they all kind of back off a bit. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6354.76s)]
*  He snaps that picture and he keeps moving, moves past them. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6357.96s)]
*  And as soon as he moves past them, he just hears a bunch of gunshots and he swings around [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6361.24s)]
*  in time to see the whole group of people just falling down. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6366.8s)]
*  They just murdered all of those cowering, terrified women and the little girls just [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6370.04s)]
*  all blown apart. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6374.68s)]
*  Now around this time, second platoon is coming in, following Callie's first platoon, and [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6378.48s)]
*  they're coming into the northwest corner of the village, out of the visual range of first [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6382.64s)]
*  platoon, really not able to see everything that's been going on. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6387.28s)]
*  As they come in, three children, about seven to nine years old, run up to the approaching [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6391.76s)]
*  Americans and they're smiling and holding out their hands in there and they're yelling, [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6397.04s)]
*  chop, chop, chop, chop, because that's what the Vietnamese kids had learned would usually [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6400.28s)]
*  get the American soldiers to give them treats. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6405.04s)]
*  But those three children were just gunned down. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6407.92s)]
*  And the second platoon starts to move into the village, they're breaking up into squads [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6412.16s)]
*  and the second platoon is jumpy. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6415.48s)]
*  They're wheeling around and firing wildly at sounds and movements. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6418.719999999999s)]
*  Anyway, one of these squads approaches a brick house. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6422.5199999999995s)]
*  There's nine people huddled together, holding each other on the front porch. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6427.0s)]
*  The three men, three women, all elderly, two kids and a little baby, they'd all been ordered [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6432.36s)]
*  out of the house by the six Americans that were now standing a few yards off from the [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6437.12s)]
*  porch. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6441.32s)]
*  No VC, no VC, the family pleaded as five of the soldiers flipped their M16s to automatic [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6442.799999999999s)]
*  and the six took his time loading his M60 machine gun with a 100 round box mag and punctuating [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6448.799999999999s)]
*  the relative silence with the clank of his bolt closing. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6454.88s)]
*  And then, this is the kind of thing that you just wonder exactly what's going on. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6459.2s)]
*  Just shooting from the hip, not even aiming, just spraying multiple magazines. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6464.799999999999s)]
*  The squad just lights up this group of Vietnamese for almost a full minute, totally unnecessary, [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6469.56s)]
*  just practically tearing their bodies apart. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6475.360000000001s)]
*  Now earlier, a few minutes ago, I tried to speculate about what a situation like this [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6478.04s)]
*  might have been like for someone who was opposed to all this or for somebody who had at least [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6484.8s)]
*  doubts or even for somebody who was overwhelmed or weak or confused. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6490.160000000001s)]
*  Events like this don't happen without monsters. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6496.44s)]
*  There were monsters. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6501.2s)]
*  A second platoon had a real monster. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6502.2s)]
*  A big guy, 6'3 or so, 230 pounds maybe, blonde haired, blue eyed monster from Kansas. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6504.92s)]
*  Everybody in Charlie Company knew him and feared him for his constant perpetual anger [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6514.08s)]
*  and crazy temper. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6519.2s)]
*  He was just one of those guys. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6520.2s)]
*  A guy like this, it's a guy who walks into a situation like the one unfolding and the [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6523.2s)]
*  world slows down. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6531.04s)]
*  It lights up for him. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6532.04s)]
*  A second platoon moves in. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6535.36s)]
*  He snatches up a child and throws him to the ground, starts beating and kicking him. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6537.719999999999s)]
*  And when an old man about half his size tries to intervene, he kills the old man and then [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6543.32s)]
*  finishes beating the child to death. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6547.5199999999995s)]
*  He walks up behind a woman and blows her apart by firing a 40mm grenade into her back and [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6551.08s)]
*  then snatches an old man and using his bowie knife he slashes and slices him up. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6556.16s)]
*  Moves on, he finds a group of soldiers surrounding 10 Vietnamese and they're trying to figure [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6565.16s)]
*  out what to do with them but when the monster arrives they just line them up and shoot them [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6569.4s)]
*  all down. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6574.32s)]
*  The first platoon by this point is starting to bump up against 1st platoon's area of [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6577.08s)]
*  operations and so the monster sees some 1st platoon men interrogating a family that they [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6580.32s)]
*  pulled out of a house and they're demanding to know where the VC is. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6585.12s)]
*  So the monster sees this and he runs over shouting, kill them all, kill them all. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6589.76s)]
*  He tries to grab one of the 1st platoon soldier's rifles because he doesn't want to use his [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6595.2s)]
*  grenade launcher at short range I guess but the 1st platoon guy holds his ground and won't [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6599.88s)]
*  give it up and so he takes another man's M16 and shouts, don't let none of them live! [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6604.12s)]
*  And he shoots the parents and then he puts the gun to the two girls' heads and shoots [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6608.76s)]
*  them and their bodies fall and their brains mingle in the dirt and starts to walk back [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6614.36s)]
*  to his squad and as he makes his way past the 1st house a man walks out to see what's [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6622.88s)]
*  happening, turns, shoots him down. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6629.04s)]
*  His wife and kids watch him hit the deck and so they run out to try to help him, shoots [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6631.76s)]
*  them down. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6636.2s)]
*  These people exist. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6638.400000000001s)]
*  These people exist too. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6640.2s)]
*  Anyway back in 1st platoon, Cali is trying to keep his men moving. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6644.56s)]
*  I mean again remember the rules, that's really all he's repeating in his head. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6649.280000000001s)]
*  Repeating Medina's order just over and over to keep moving, drive the enemy back, do not [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6654.08s)]
*  let them fan out and whatever you do don't let anyone get behind you. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6659.08s)]
*  Keep moving, drive the enemy back, don't let them fan out, don't let anyone behind you. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6664.36s)]
*  Keep moving, drive the enemy back. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6669.12s)]
*  By this point many soldiers are just firing at anything they see. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6671.36s)]
*  Not all of them but many of them. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6675.48s)]
*  The photographer, Ronald Haberly, this is his 1st hard contact with enemy and he's watching [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6677.5199999999995s)]
*  this, he's just completely in shock and he tries to describe it later and he describes [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6682.64s)]
*  it with the memory of somebody who was in shock. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6685.92s)]
*  He says, it was just shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot at anything. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6688.32s)]
*  I don't care what moved. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6691.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean it's just a person would come out of a hut, bang, shoot. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6692.719999999999s)]
*  It was just complete carnage there that day. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6697.16s)]
*  Now for an effective sweep through a village to do what it is they're actually supposed [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6700.599999999999s)]
*  to be trying to do, a platoon's got to maintain a tight formation and they've got to work [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6706.84s)]
*  together but almost immediately when they entered the village that just completely came [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6710.92s)]
*  apart. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6716.719999999999s)]
*  There were too many civilians to control and some of the men were wandering off in smaller [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6717.92s)]
*  groups with murder in their eyes. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6722.0s)]
*  It was just nobody had any control of the situation. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6724.16s)]
*  Within just a few minutes of entering the village, 1st platoon had accumulated about [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6728.320000000001s)]
*  50 civilians and they rounded them up into a group and almost all of them women and children [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6731.72s)]
*  and old people and they're terrified and crying and some of them are slow, they're little [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6737.64s)]
*  kids and old people and so they're trying to get them moving through the village, trying [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6742.320000000001s)]
*  to get them through west to east to come out the eastern edge. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6746.04s)]
*  Move fast, don't stop, don't let anyone get behind you. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6749.56s)]
*  But this group is too large and unwieldy and so they're stalling out near the trail junction [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6753.56s)]
*  around the middle of the village. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6758.08s)]
*  And Cali's looking around and he just can't move fast enough to satisfy Medina with this [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6761.16s)]
*  group of people but he can't leave them behind either. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6766.24s)]
*  Nearby a woman carrying an infant and accompanying by a toddler comes out of her house and says [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6771.4400000000005s)]
*  oh, this woman's startles two Americans so they swing around and fire and they wound [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6775.8s)]
*  her, they don't kill her and so they send her over to Cali to join this group of Vietnamese [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6779.24s)]
*  civilians that it's accumulating and after they send her off they turn and they talk [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6784.72s)]
*  about seeing a very old woman, old old woman struggling to walk down a trail because she's [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6791.320000000001s)]
*  been shot by an M79 40mm grenade launcher only the grenade had not exploded and it was [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6798.4800000000005s)]
*  embedded in her stomach. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6805.6s)]
*  That's just an image, you know, it's just one of those, there's a few of these images [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6808.92s)]
*  in here and most of them honestly aren't even the ones that are over the top, gory. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6813.240000000001s)]
*  It's the idea of somebody's great grandmother trying to struggle down a trail with an unexploded [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6818.76s)]
*  grenade embedded in her guts, you know. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6826.0s)]
*  Around that time two young privates, you know, just two 18 year old kids, I just, I can't [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6831.2s)]
*  get away from that, especially now, you know, maybe when I was 18 it seemed normal but not [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6837.0s)]
*  all this but just the idea of an 18 year old acting like an adult. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6841.5199999999995s)]
*  Now that I'm a little older it makes me sad. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6845.24s)]
*  I know that's not necessarily the appropriate feeling for these people but there's something [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6849.96s)]
*  to it, there's something of sadness to it when I think about it. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6856.88s)]
*  So these two young privates, 18 year old kids, they burst into a hut and in there [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6860.48s)]
*  they find three small children clinging to an old man and an old woman, both of whom [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6866.599999999999s)]
*  had already been wounded. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6870.5599999999995s)]
*  And so one of the privates pulls this 45 and places it against the old man's head and says, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6872.0s)]
*  you know, something about this being a mercy killing, you know, he's already, this is to [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6879.04s)]
*  put him out of his misery or something and he blows his brains out in front of his children. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6884.08s)]
*  A sergeant looks into a hooch and sees several women and a bunch of children so he pulls [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6889.08s)]
*  the pin on a grenade and throws it in all over the place. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6894.8s)]
*  They're looking into huts and hooches and houses and down into bunkers and if they see [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6897.5199999999995s)]
*  people they're just pulling grenades and throwing them in. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6902.36s)]
*  Near the center of the village there's a small Buddhist temple and 20 women and kids, they [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6906.68s)]
*  were burning incense and they were kneeling down praying because what else are you going [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6912.44s)]
*  to do in the midst of this? [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6916.44s)]
*  A group of Americans comes up behind them and executes them all at close range, 20 people, [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6918.2s)]
*  20 women and kids. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6923.48s)]
*  Another soldier's pushing an old man down a trail by himself, just roughly shoving him [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6926.36s)]
*  and kicking him and, you know, the old man's doing what he says, he's trying to comply [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6931.5599999999995s)]
*  but he's shoving him roughly and then suddenly without any reason at all the soldier just [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6935.72s)]
*  shoves his bayonet into the old man's back. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6941.08s)]
*  And for some reason, you know, this is another one that sticks with me more than some of [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6944.96s)]
*  the others. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6951.0s)]
*  You know, it just, you know, he's not in the center of it all, he's not caught up in the [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6954.0s)]
*  madness, you know, he's off to the side a bit, set apart from the rest of the group, [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6961.6s)]
*  not caught up in the chaos of it all, you know, he's pushing the old man down the trail [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6966.72s)]
*  by himself and the old man's complying and the old man's not facing him, he's looking [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6972.44s)]
*  away so the soldier's there with his own thoughts and since the man's complying, you know, presumably [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6977.36s)]
*  the soldier had his wits about him in that moment, I imagine at least, and he could have [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6984.24s)]
*  shot him, you know, I mean, that's not good, but I mean, he could have shot him but instead [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6990.12s)]
*  he stuck him with his bayonet. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6994.36s)]
*  And I almost imagine him as if he was walking there thinking that, you know, he had seen [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=6997.96s)]
*  in movies and heard stories about sticking someone with a blade and now here he was, [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7005.68s)]
*  you know, with a man in front of him, he's walking and he can do whatever he wants. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7011.72s)]
*  He's got a blade, there it is, right there. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7018.36s)]
*  He can stick it in, nothing will happen to him, he can do it just to do it, he can do [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7020.8s)]
*  it just so he can know once and for all what it feels like in your hands to stick a blade [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7026.44s)]
*  in someone, whether it slides in easily or if the body resists it or, but no, no, no, [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7030.48s)]
*  that's crazy, I can't do that, but of course I can, look around, look at what's happening [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7036.96s)]
*  all around me, I can do whatever I want, no, no, no, no, this is crazy, and then for no [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7041.94s)]
*  reason at all if you're an outsider watching this not hearing the angel and devil at war [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7050.0s)]
*  on his shoulders he just sticks it in and the old man falls to the ground and then the [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7056.06s)]
*  soldier finishes him off and then that soldier walks over to a cowering young boy and lifts [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7062.46s)]
*  him up and throws him down a well and follows it up by throwing a grenade in after him, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7070.1s)]
*  and that happened too. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7076.1s)]
*  Now back with the large group, the Americans in direct range of Cali are pulling people [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7080.74s)]
*  out of their houses and they're adding them to the growing group of civilians that's being [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7088.82s)]
*  pushed west to east through the village. A Vietnamese survivor just remembered that they [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7093.2s)]
*  started to take us all away, everyone in my house they took us to leave, and a female [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7098.78s)]
*  survivor said that they were really rushing them, I held one of my children and led the [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7103.0599999999995s)]
*  other one, I walked with them until they told us to stop, they made us walk from inside [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7107.3s)]
*  the village across the rice fields, I told my kids to go with me, I dragged my kids but [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7111.820000000001s)]
*  they still hit us, kicked us. Now Medina's at his command post outside the village and [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7116.58s)]
*  he's getting angry because things aren't moving as quickly as he planned and so he gets on [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7125.66s)]
*  the radio with Cali wanting to know what's going on, Medina says, where are you? And [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7129.9800000000005s)]
*  Cali says, I'm on the eastern edge, I'm checking the bunkers out. Medina says, well damn it [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7134.86s)]
*  I didn't tell you to check them out, get your men in position. Cali, I have a lot of Vietnamese [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7139.34s)]
*  here, Medina get rid of them, get your men in position now. Cali, Roger. And so Cali [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7144.62s)]
*  goes up to a young soldier named Paul Meadlow who's standing guard over the group of civilians [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7153.179999999999s)]
*  now that they've made it over to the eastern edge of the hamlet near an irrigation ditch [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7158.26s)]
*  that kind of serves as a barrier. You know what to do with them don't you? Cali said [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7162.82s)]
*  to Meadlow and Meadlow said that he did. And right then a few meters out of the way, off [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7168.54s)]
*  the trail, Cali notices one of his men alone with a young Vietnamese woman who's holding [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7175.38s)]
*  tightly to her young child. And this soldier, this American soldier is holding the woman [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7182.14s)]
*  tightly by a chunk of her wound up hair and he's forced her to her knees to perform oral [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7188.06s)]
*  sex on him and he's ensuring her compliance by putting the barrel of his gun to her four [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7194.860000000001s)]
*  year old son's head. And so sprinting over Cali screams at him to get his pants back [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7200.26s)]
*  up and get back into position. And Cali didn't know probably that by this time already at [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7209.22s)]
*  least nine women and girls had been sexually assaulted by the Americans. Later on Cali [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7215.66s)]
*  explained why he behaved, why he reacted the way he did. To seeing that he said quote, [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7221.86s)]
*  if a GI is getting a blow job he isn't doing his job. He isn't destroying communism. He [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7229.26s)]
*  isn't doing what we're paying him for. He isn't combat effective end quote. Okay. So [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7234.42s)]
*  anyway, there are several helicopters overhead. Some of them are providing support and three [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7242.42s)]
*  of them are circling counter-clockwise over the action just to observe the whole situation [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7249.9800000000005s)]
*  unfold. So people are watching this. There's a major general on one of those observation [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7253.78s)]
*  helicopters. One of the helicopters providing support belongs to Hugh Thompson. And seeing [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7258.5s)]
*  the large group of women and children assembled over near the ditch, he lands his helicopter [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7264.62s)]
*  and approaches one of the soldiers guarding him and he says these are civilians. We've [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7269.22s)]
*  got to help them. And the soldier just looks at him and says something like sure we'll [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7272.900000000001s)]
*  help them out of their misery or something like that. Thompson really doesn't, he doesn't [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7278.1s)]
*  really fully grasp what's going on right now. I mean how would you just, it's a big conclusion [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7283.38s)]
*  to jump to. He just doesn't want to believe it. He's trying to give people the benefit [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7288.46s)]
*  of the doubt. And so he just repeats the order. We've got to help these civilians. And then [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7292.3s)]
*  he goes back and gets into his chopper to get back in the air. After Callie had gotten [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7295.86s)]
*  the rapist back into position, his radio man let him know that Medina's back on the line [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7301.86s)]
*  already again wanting to know what's going on. Medina says, what are you doing now? Callie, [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7306.38s)]
*  I'm getting ready to go. Now damn it! I told you to get your men in position now! Why did [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7311.82s)]
*  you disobey my damn order? I have these bunkers here. To hell with the bunkers! And these [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7317.339999999999s)]
*  people here, they aren't moving too swiftly. I don't want that crap. Now damn it! Waste [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7323.0199999999995s)]
*  all those goddamn people and get in damn position! Callie, Roger. So after trying to pull his [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7328.18s)]
*  men together for about 15 minutes, Callie returns to the large group of Vietnamese civilians [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7337.34s)]
*  guarded by Mee Lo just as Thompson's helicopter is getting back off the ground. There are [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7342.62s)]
*  about 70 or 80 frightened people sitting there on the ground. And the soldier whom [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7348.34s)]
*  Callie had caught sexually assaulting the girl was standing next to Mee Lo now guarding [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7354.46s)]
*  the civilians. And the Vietnamese were all sitting there and just waiting to see what [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7359.38s)]
*  was going to happen. Callie said to Mee Lo as he comes up, he's pissed off, he's angry, [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7363.26s)]
*  and he says, how come you ain't killed them yet? And Mee Lo responds that he didn't know [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7368.7s)]
*  that that's what he was supposed to do. He thought Callie just meant that he was supposed [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7373.56s)]
*  to continue guarding them. No, Callie said, so he says, no, I want them dead! And so Mee [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7377.02s)]
*  Lo, he's just a kid, Mee Lo and the other soldier look at each other and then they kind [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7384.46s)]
*  of step back to stand with a few other soldiers that are nearby. Kind of, you know, it's an [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7390.780000000001s)]
*  interesting reaction but I understand it in a way. And so Callie says, come here! And [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7396.22s)]
*  they kind of stand and he says, come on, we'll line them up, we'll kill them! And the other [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7402.14s)]
*  soldier, the rapist, he said he didn't want to waste ammunition for his main weapon, the [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7407.38s)]
*  grenade launcher. It was kind of an excuse he came up with because he didn't want to [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7414.46s)]
*  do this. And so he said he'd take his grenade launcher and he'd go back along the tree [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7418.18s)]
*  line to stop, you know, he'd be a backstop basically against anybody that tried to escape. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7422.62s)]
*  But Mee Lo didn't have an excuse and so he finally stepped forward and joined Callie [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7427.06s)]
*  on the line. And Callie looked hard at him. When I say fire, fire at them! About ten feet [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7430.46s)]
*  from the group, Callie and Mee Lo set their weapons to automatic and they just start spraying [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7439.78s)]
*  magazines into the helpless Vietnamese as mothers scramble to cover their children and [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7446.66s)]
*  the children screamed and the old men and women are wailing. After about a minute of [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7452.5s)]
*  shooting, Mee Lo stops firing and he's crying now and so he starts to walk off and he tries [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7458.3s)]
*  to shove his weapon into the hands of another soldier and he says, you shoot them! But the [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7465.3s)]
*  other soldier puts his hands up, he refuses to take it and then he pushes the weapon back [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7469.54s)]
*  and points at Callie and says, let him shoot him, he looks like he's enjoying it. Right [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7474.26s)]
*  at that point, half a dozen children or so began to stand up, they'd been shielded and [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7480.18s)]
*  covered by the adults' bodies. They're starting to pull themselves out from under the bloody [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7487.58s)]
*  remains of those adults who'd protected them. They're standing up and they're crying and [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7494.900000000001s)]
*  pulling at their mothers and grandparents to get up off the ground and so Callie reloads [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7500.18s)]
*  his M16 and pop, pop, pop, just picks them off one by one as the backstop soldier, the [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7505.58s)]
*  rapist, is screaming at him to stop. And then after that, after he kills those children, [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7512.82s)]
*  another dozen or so women and kids kind of clamber up to their feet and start stumbling [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7521.78s)]
*  toward the treeline and so Callie screamed at his man, don't let him get away, kill them, [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7526.62s)]
*  kill them! But the soldier with the grenade launcher, he aims it over their heads on purpose [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7531.82s)]
*  and just fires off into the jungle, says he did it on accident. In a later interview, [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7537.26s)]
*  Callie said, he addressed this part, he's a hard guy to figure out, but he said, quote, [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7545.1s)]
*  on babies, everyone's really hung up. Those on the outside could not understand what was [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7557.38s)]
*  at stake and yet always cast the most severe judgment. But babies, they exclaim, the little [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7562.26s)]
*  innocent babies, Americans have been fighting in Vietnam for ten years. If we're in Vietnam [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7568.18s)]
*  another ten, if your son is killed by those babies, you'll cry at me, why didn't you kill [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7573.6s)]
*  those babies that day? End quote. So this killing would go on for four hours and the [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7578.820000000001s)]
*  Americans would not suffer a single casualty that day. Several of them even stopped in [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7585.82s)]
*  the middle of it all to take lunch. So there was no danger here, this was not a fight, [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7590.82s)]
*  this was not a fight at all. Shortly after lifting off from where the civilians had been [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7597.82s)]
*  assembled by the ditch, Hugh Thompson and his helicopter crew heard firing and so they [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7605.82s)]
*  swung around and they saw that Callie and Mee-Lo were shooting all those people. His [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7611.82s)]
*  door gunner, one of his door gunners, Lawrence Colburn, remembered that Thompson just did [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7616.82s)]
*  not want to believe what he was seeing and so he kept trying to give the men on the ground [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7621.82s)]
*  the benefit of the doubt, but after the mass murder at the ditch he was just beside himself [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7625.82s)]
*  and he's calling out over the radio that civilians are being killed down there. And when he [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7630.82s)]
*  didn't get much of a response over the radio he turns to his crew, they're just young kids [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7636.82s)]
*  at this point, and he says we've got to do something and are they with him? And they [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7641.82s)]
*  said that they were with him. And so down below they see a group of about a dozen women [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7647.82s)]
*  and kids, maybe a few more, running along a hedgerow toward a bunker being chased by [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7652.82s)]
*  a group of American soldiers. Thompson estimated that those Vietnamese had about 30 seconds [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7657.82s)]
*  to live and so this man, this great man, the hero, and the crew of heroes in his helicopter, [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7663.82s)]
*  they swing down to land near the bunker as the people are jumping inside. Thompson is [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7672.82s)]
*  preparing to get out and he tells his crew, I'm going out there. If those American soldiers [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7679.82s)]
*  fire their weapons or try to get into that bunker, kill them. And so without drawing [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7685.82s)]
*  his own weapon Thompson gets out and he blocks the pursuing American soldiers from that bunker [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7691.82s)]
*  and suddenly the Americans looked up and they recognized the helicopter and its mounted [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7696.82s)]
*  machine guns pointed right at them. And one of those men later described that moment almost [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7701.82s)]
*  as if it was like waking up from a dream. And so the men turned and left and Thompson [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7707.82s)]
*  called a friend on the radio, Dan Mallions, he was a pilot of a Huey gunship in the area. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7713.82s)]
*  He told him he needed his help right now. Now gunships do not land alone in unauthorized [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7719.82s)]
*  areas without support. It just doesn't happen. But Mallions took his Huey in and landed in that [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7727.82s)]
*  place to rescue those people. And this is one of the things that just keeps standing out to you [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7733.82s)]
*  when you see the pictures and videos of this stuff. You cannot believe it when you see pictures of [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7739.82s)]
*  Mallions from back then, this Huey pilot. He looks like a little boy. He looks like he's 15 years old. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7745.82s)]
*  And yet he flew in there when his friend called and he landed his Hilo without authorization [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7751.82s)]
*  and they got those people out of there. They had to leave in two groups because there was only so much [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7757.82s)]
*  room. And so Thompson and his crewmen, Lawrence Colburn and Glenn Andriotta, I haven't said a lot of [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7763.82s)]
*  names in this for a reason, but I'm saying their names because these men are heroes. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7769.82s)]
*  Those three stayed there to guard the Vietnamese until they were taken to safety by Mallions. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7775.82s)]
*  Once they were back in the air, Thompson flew back to survey the damage at the irrigation ditch [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7781.82s)]
*  and the damage was total. Bodies and blood filled the muddy water, but one of the crewmen [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7787.82s)]
*  noticed movement so they touched down again and they saw a child, a little boy, was moving. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7793.82s)]
*  I've written some places it was a little girl, but it doesn't matter I guess. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7799.82s)]
*  The door gunner Colburn remembers reaching down to pick the boy up by his clothes and [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7805.82s)]
*  that the only thing that was in his head as he reached down to do that was that he was [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7811.82s)]
*  holding a gun and he was holding a gun and he was holding a gun and he was holding a gun and he was [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7815.82s)]
*  holding a gun and the only thing that was in his head as he reached down to do that was that he was worried that his buttons would give out [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7821.82s)]
*  and the little boy would then fall back into the water among all the bodies. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7825.82s)]
*  The little boy, he remembers, quote, he's alive today, he remembers back, he says, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7829.82s)]
*  I looked up and saw a helicopter landing in the rice fields. I was really scared, wasn't sure if they'd shoot again, [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7839.82s)]
*  but when I lifted my head I saw three American soldiers approach, so I pretended to be dead. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7845.82s)]
*  But the Americans, three of them, came down into the ditch. I looked up a second time and they pulled me out, end quote. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7851.82s)]
*  They carried that boy to their helicopter and they flew him themselves out to Kuang Nga Hospital, [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7861.82s)]
*  I said, I wasn't too far away if you went by air. They left him with a nun at the hospital telling her that the boy likely had no parents or family left alive. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7869.82s)]
*  Years later, just as a little aside, I think it was CBS or NBC, whatever channel Mike Wallace was on, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7881.82s)]
*  they did, I want to say a 10 or 20 year anniversary, I think it was a, oh no goodness, it's 1968, it was a 30 year anniversary, it was in 1998 of My Lai. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7891.82s)]
*  And they actually got a hold of Hugh Thompson and they took him out to the area where it happened [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7903.82s)]
*  and some of the villagers who were kids then, they still live in the same area. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7911.82s)]
*  And that little boy, that little boy's there and they went there and he recognized Hugh Thompson, he's very powerful. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7917.82s)]
*  Several people who were saved by him and his crew recognized him and you get to see him interact with each other. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7926.82s)]
*  It was a very beautiful thing, very moving. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7933.82s)]
*  So they dropped that boy off at the hospital and back in the village, finally the officers are trying to get a hold of the men. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7941.82s)]
*  It's starting to spread a little bit that an American officer in a helicopter had come in and pointed guns at some men to get them to stop [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7953.82s)]
*  and a few other things were happening and things were finally starting to slow down. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7961.82s)]
*  The officers would order a ceasefire and the guns would go quiet and then someone would fire again somewhere [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7966.82s)]
*  and it would all start back up over for a time until another ceasefire was ordered and then it all repeated again and this went on for a while. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7972.82s)]
*  But when finally the shooting stopped, the few survivors, mostly a few children hidden away, they began to creep out. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7979.82s)]
*  One of them who was a very young boy at the time remembered in an interview, and he's just weeping as he says this, [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7988.82s)]
*  he remembers coming out at the end, he says, quote, My grandmother, I called to her, Grandma, Grandma. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=7995.82s)]
*  I thought she was almost dead. She raised her hand. She said, Grandma is here, dear, lying here. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8003.82s)]
*  They shot me right in my arm. When I called to my sister, she was outside. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8010.82s)]
*  She just lay there unconscious. But when she heard me call, she woke up and crawled over. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8015.82s)]
*  The three of us held each other and cried. We were covered in blood. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8021.82s)]
*  The village was burned. The wells were corrupted and the animals were killed. The food was destroyed. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8032.82s)]
*  It was reported back to command that the Americans had won a great victory after a fierce firefight, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8042.82s)]
*  killing 128 Viet Cong fighters and unfortunately, of course, catching 22 civilians in the crossfire. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8049.82s)]
*  Commanding General Westmoreland congratulated the men on an outstanding job and back home, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8060.82s)]
*  Stars and Stripes reported that US infantrymen had killed 128 communists in a bloody daylong battle. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8066.82s)]
*  In reality, they had they had murdered something close to 500 innocent people. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8074.82s)]
*  A few whistleblowers reported on what had happened that day up the chain of command, but it was just ignored. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8085.82s)]
*  It would be a whole it would be another year and a half before investigative journalist Seymour Hirsch [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8092.82s)]
*  brought the story to the American public, a contribution for which he was and still is by many people [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8099.82s)]
*  regarded as an anti-American communist sympathizer. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8106.82s)]
*  Callie maintained to the very end that he was following orders and that he had done his job, [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8113.82s)]
*  but a court martial found him guilty of murdering no fewer than 20 people himself and sentenced him to life in prison. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8119.82s)]
*  But two days after the sentence was passed, President Nixon ordered Callie released and confined to house arrest during the appeal process. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8126.82s)]
*  In August 1971, his sentence was reduced from life to 20 years. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8135.82s)]
*  Captain Medina, who was seen personally by Hugh Thompson's helicopter crew, kicking a woman on the ground and then shooting her in the head, [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8142.82s)]
*  he denied giving the orders that virtually every man in the company agreed that he had given, and he was acquitted of all charges. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8156.82s)]
*  Of the 26 men charged with the crime after the Mili massacre, only Lieutenant William Callie was ever convicted, [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8167.82s)]
*  and in the end he served only three and a half years on house arrest before being paroled, and he walks free to this day. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8176.82s)]
*  The secretary of the army was later quoted saying that Callie had been paroled because [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8187.82s)]
*  at the time he had truly believed that he had just been following his orders. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8192.82s)]
*  And Callie tries to make much that same point, but he puts it slightly differently. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8199.82s)]
*  In an interview later he said, quote, Personally, I didn't kill any Vietnamese that day. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8207.82s)]
*  I mean me. Personally. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8216.82s)]
*  Personally, I represented the United States of America. My country. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8219.82s)]

*  Make a known, that I turn it down [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pttO_L6ack&t=8283.82s)]
