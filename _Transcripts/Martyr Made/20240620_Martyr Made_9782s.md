**Martyr Made:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo)

*  ritual cannibalism. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=13.02s)]
*  This episode was inspired by my friend Daniele's History on Fire podcast series on the Spanish [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=15.68s)]
*  conquest of the Aztec Empire. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=20.400000000000002s)]

*  this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Hope you guys didn't like this one. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  It's a little dark. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=50.24s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=51.24s)]
*  I'm content to die for my beliefs. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=52.24s)]
*  So cut off my head and make me a martyr. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=60.24s)]
*  The people will always remember it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=66.12s)]
*  No, they won't forget. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=68.12s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=69.12s)]
*  God is a thought. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=70.12s)]
*  God is an idea. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=71.12s)]
*  It is a way of life. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=72.12s)]
*  It is a way of life. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=73.12s)]
*  It is a way of life. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=74.12s)]
*  It is a way of life. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=75.12s)]
*  It is a way of life. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=76.12s)]
*  It is a way of life. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=77.12s)]
*  It is a way of life. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=78.12s)]
*  It is a way of life. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=79.12s)]
*  It is a way of life. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=80.12s)]
*  It is a way of life. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=81.12s)]
*  It is a place. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=82.12s)]
*  It is somewhere. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=83.12s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=84.12s)]
*  But its reference is to something that transcends all thinking. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=85.12s)]
*  I must call the fire. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=86.12s)]
*  We must tear ourselves apart for this small question of religion. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=87.12s)]
*  One of my very favorite authors of fiction, Ursula Le Guin, has this wonderful little [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=108.6s)]
*  short story called The Ones Who Walk Away from Omeleus. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  Le Guin begins her little story. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=117.16s)]
*  Just a few short pages, a beautiful little story. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=120.24s)]
*  She begins by describing the idyllic fictional town called Omeleus and all of its joyful [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  inhabitants as they're preparing for a festival when the story opens up. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=129.74s)]
*  Now in the town of Omeleus, it's a utopian town. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=133.6s)]
*  No one wants for anything. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=137.76000000000002s)]
*  No one is oppressed. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  The families get along and the families love one another. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=140.84s)]
*  They love each other. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=145.12s)]
*  The community is very cohesive. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=146.12s)]
*  Everything works. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=148.5s)]
*  The story opens. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  It's the festival of summer. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  It's just beginning. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  And so the seaside town is decorated for celebration. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=154.68s)]
*  And all the men are working, contentedly putting their hands to their tasks while mothers with [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=157.52s)]
*  babies smile and chat with one another in the park. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=163.16s)]
*  And all the groups of people dance and play instruments, you know, fill in the rest however [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=167.16s)]
*  you want to fill it in. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=170.88s)]
*  You know, people are dressed in bright colors and children are running, trailing streamers [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  behind them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  And yet Le Guin writes to us, they were not simple folk, though they were happy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=180.04s)]
*  But we do not say the words of cheer much anymore. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=185.72s)]
*  All smiles have become archaic. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=188.48s)]
*  Given a description such as this, one tends to make certain assumptions. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=192.32s)]
*  Given a description such as this, one tends to look next for the king mounted on a splendid [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=197.28s)]
*  stallion and surrounded by his noble knights or perhaps on a golden litter born by great [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=202.12s)]
*  muscled slaves. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=207.4s)]
*  But there was no king. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=209.84s)]
*  They did not use swords or keep slaves. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=211.92s)]
*  They were not barbarians. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=215.2s)]
*  I do not know the rules and laws of their society, but I suspect that they were singularly [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  few. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=222.12s)]
*  As they did without monarchy and slavery, so they also got on without the stock exchange, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=224.44s)]
*  the advertisement, the secret police, and the bomb. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=229.24s)]
*  Yet I repeat that these were not simple folk, not dulcet shepherds, noble savages, bland [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=233.44s)]
*  utopians. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=239.44s)]
*  They were not less complex than us. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=241.24s)]
*  And then Le Guin makes very plain to us that she's dealing in fantasy. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  She admits it in the story. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=250.6s)]
*  She says that her illustration here of the town of Omeleus, it might not suit every reader. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=252.12s)]
*  So she encourages us, the readers, to imagine the town and its people however we need to, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=257.52s)]
*  to make the utopia the way our utopia would be. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  She encourages us to do that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  And so as we follow the joyous procession of parade goers and festival goers near to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=268.78s)]
*  its end, we're caught up in the reverie of no place and we're almost wanting to willfully [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=274.76s)]
*  ignore the impossibility of this vision because it's so beautiful. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=279.24s)]
*  When Le Guin, the dark sorceress, turns it around on us and reveals her magic, this is [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=284.76s)]
*  why Le Guin is so good. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=289.08s)]
*  Quote, do you believe? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=291.36s)]
*  Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  No? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=298.56s)]
*  Then let me describe one more thing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=300.08s)]
*  In a basement, under one of the beautiful public buildings of Omeleus, or perhaps in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=303.44s)]
*  the cellar of one of its spacious private homes, there is a room. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=308.96s)]
*  It has one locked door and no window. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=314.16s)]
*  A little light seeps in dustily between the cracks in the board, secondhand from a cobwebbed [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=316.68s)]
*  window somewhere across the cellar. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=321.48s)]
*  In one corner of the little room a couple of mops with stiff, clotted, foul-smelling [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=325.24s)]
*  heads stand near a rusty bucket. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=330.32s)]
*  The floor is dirt, a little damp to the touch, cellar dirt usually is. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=333.96s)]
*  The room is about three paces long and too wide, a mere broom closet or disused toolroom. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=340.68s)]
*  In the room, a child is sitting. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=347.26s)]
*  It could be a boy or a girl. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=350.12s)]
*  It looks about six but is actually nearly ten. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=352.4s)]
*  It is feeble-minded. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=356.16s)]
*  Perhaps it was born defective or perhaps it has become imbecile through fear, malnutrition, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=360.1s)]
*  and neglect. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=364.74s)]
*  It picks its nose and occasionally fumbles vaguely with its toes or genitals as it sits [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=365.74s)]
*  hunched in the corner farthest from the bucket and the two mops. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=371.38s)]
*  It is afraid of the mops, finds them horrible. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=374.94s)]
*  It shuts its eyes but it knows the mops are still standing there and the door is locked [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=381.36s)]
*  and nobody will come. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=386.34000000000003s)]
*  The door is always locked and nobody ever comes except that sometimes the child has [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=388.94s)]
*  no understanding of time or interval. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=395.1s)]
*  Sometimes the door rattles terribly and opens and a person or several people are there. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=398.4s)]
*  One of them may come up and kick the child to make it stand up. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=404.94s)]
*  The others never come close but peer in at it with frightened, disgusted eyes. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=408.86s)]
*  The food bowl and the water jug are hastily filled. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=414.9s)]
*  The door is locked. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=417.5s)]
*  The eyes disappear. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=418.94s)]
*  The people at the door never say anything but the child, who has not always lived in [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=421.5s)]
*  the tool room and can remember sunlight and its mother's voice, sometimes speaks. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=425.98s)]
*  I will be good, it says. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=431.02s)]
*  Please let me out. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=433.34s)]
*  I will be good. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=434.34s)]
*  They never answer. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=436.24s)]
*  The child used to scream for help at night and cry a good deal but now it only makes [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=438.54s)]
*  a kind of whining, ee-ha, ee-ha, and it speaks less and less often. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=443.24s)]
*  It is so thin that there are no calves to its legs. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  Its belly protrudes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=454.64s)]
*  It lives on a half bowl of cornmeal and grease a day. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=456.6s)]
*  It is naked. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=461.40000000000003s)]
*  Its buttocks and thighs are a mass of festered sores as it sits in its own excrement continually. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=463.44s)]
*  They all know it is there, all the people of Omeros. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=470.8s)]
*  Some of them have come to see it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=474.8s)]
*  Others are content merely to know that it is there. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=477.04s)]
*  They all know that it has to be there. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=481.32s)]
*  Some of them understand why and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=485.0s)]
*  the beauty of their city, the tenderness of their friendships, the health of their children, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=490.48s)]
*  the wisdom of their scholars, the skill of their makers, even the abundance of their [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=495.2s)]
*  harvests and the kindly weather of their skies depend wholly on this child's abominable [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=499.08000000000004s)]
*  misery. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=505.08000000000004s)]
*  This is usually explained to children when they are between eight and twelve, whenever [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=508.36s)]
*  they seem capable of understanding, and most of those who come to see the child are young [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=512.12s)]
*  people though often enough an adult comes, or comes back, to see the child. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=517.04s)]
*  No matter how well the matter has been explained to them, these young spectators are always [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=524.38s)]
*  shocked and sickened at the sight. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=528.94s)]
*  They feel disgust, which they had thought themselves superior to. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=531.98s)]
*  They feel anger, outrage, impotence, despite all the explanations. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=537.0200000000001s)]
*  They would like to do something for the child, but there is nothing they can do. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=542.08s)]
*  If the child were brought up into the sunlight out of that vile place, if it were cleaned [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=547.62s)]
*  and fed and comforted, that would be a good thing indeed, but if it were done, in that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=552.2600000000001s)]
*  day and hour all the prosperity and beauty and delight of Omeolus would wither and be [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=558.1s)]
*  destroyed. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=563.34s)]
*  Those are the terms. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=565.76s)]
*  To exchange all the goodness and grace of every life in Omeolus for that single small [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=568.66s)]
*  improvement, to throw away the happiness of thousands for the chance of the happiness [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=573.78s)]
*  of one, that would be to let guilt within the walls indeed. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=579.92s)]
*  The terms are strict and absolute. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=586.58s)]
*  There may not even be a kind word spoken to the child. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=588.82s)]
*  Often the young people go home in tears or in a tearless rage when they have seen the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=594.5400000000001s)]
*  child and faced this terrible paradox. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=598.5400000000001s)]
*  They may brood over it for weeks or years, but as time goes on they begin to realize [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=602.34s)]
*  that even if the child could be released, it would not get much good of its freedom. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=607.4200000000001s)]
*  A little vague pleasure of warmth and food, no doubt, but little more. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=612.38s)]
*  It is too degraded and imbecile to know any real joy. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=616.9s)]
*  It has been afraid too long to ever be free of fear. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=622.02s)]
*  Its habits are too uncouth for it to respond to humane treatment. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=625.94s)]
*  Indeed, after so long it would probably be wretched without the walls about it to protect [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=630.82s)]
*  it and darkness for its eyes and its own excrement to sit in. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=636.4200000000001s)]
*  Their tears at the bitter injustice dry when they begin to perceive the terrible justice [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=643.6600000000001s)]
*  of reality and to accept it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=648.1s)]
*  Yet it is their tears and anger, the trying of their generosity and the acceptance of [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=652.4200000000001s)]
*  their helplessness, which are perhaps the true source of the splendor of their lives. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=657.6600000000001s)]
*  Theirs is no vapid, irresponsible happiness. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=664.7s)]
*  They know that they, like the child, are not free. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=667.98s)]
*  They know compassion. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=672.22s)]
*  It is the existence of the child and their knowledge of its existence that makes possible [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=673.7s)]
*  the nobility of their architecture, the poignancy of their music, the profundity of their science. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=680.0600000000001s)]
*  It is because of the child that they are so gentle with their own children. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=686.1800000000001s)]
*  They know that if the wretched one were not there sniveling in the dark, the other one, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=692.62s)]
*  the flute player, could make no joyful music as the young riders line up in their beauty [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=697.1s)]
*  for the race in the sunlight of the first morning of summer. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=702.58s)]
*  Now, do you believe in them? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=705.98s)]
*  Are they not now more credible? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=710.34s)]
*  I love Le Guin, and what's wonderful about a story like this is that it works at almost [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=716.1s)]
*  any level that you feel like playing at. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=721.3399999999999s)]
*  You can read it psychologically. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=725.06s)]
*  That's a pretty easy one. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=726.68s)]
*  Every one of us has to subdue the free and naive children that we once were in order [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=728.14s)]
*  to survive and remain presentable in the adult world. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=733.5799999999999s)]
*  You can read it politically because every society seems to grease the skids of internal [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=738.06s)]
*  cohesion by projecting its collective hatred and hostility out onto an other, either outside [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=744.3199999999999s)]
*  or at the bottom of their own society. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=750.04s)]
*  Or you can read it culturally. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=754.68s)]
*  Every culture has skeletons hiding in plain sight, which if you stripped them of the familiarity [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=757.28s)]
*  that we've developed for them over a lifetime of close contact and indoctrination, they [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=763.16s)]
*  would appear to us as monstrous as they in fact very often are. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  Today, secular activists in the West are morally and ethically appalled at the Christian resistance [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=775.28s)]
*  to things like gay marriage and abortion, right? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  But almost nobody seems all that concerned about the fact that those Christians all gather [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=783.52s)]
*  on Sundays to worship a victim of torture and execution and then pretend to eat his [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=788.36s)]
*  flesh and drink his blood. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=793.52s)]
*  A good part of Western civilization gets together weekly to vicariously practice what is arguably [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=796.0799999999999s)]
*  the single most powerful taboo we still have in place, and everybody is fine with that [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=802.92s)]
*  part. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=808.12s)]
*  They almost never mention it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=809.12s)]
*  And then of course you can keep going with it because the psychological and cultural [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=813.0799999999999s)]
*  and political readings of the story are all interrelated and nested within one another. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=816.4399999999999s)]
*  Just to take one example, all parents have to suppress the early oral fixation in their [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=822.04s)]
*  young children, right? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=827.78s)]
*  And this means breaking the child to a degree and forcing it to either repress its behavior [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=829.56s)]
*  or find some sort of more acceptable substitute. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=833.88s)]
*  We're going to get into this later, by the way. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=837.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm just using it as an example now. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=838.4s)]
*  If you have a very, very young child and he bites somebody, you know, we'll gently correct [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=840.3599999999999s)]
*  him. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=845.2399999999999s)]
*  An older child is going to be punished or counseled, but an adult who bites, even in [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=846.2399999999999s)]
*  the middle of a fight, is going to be seen as just almost unirredeemably uncivilized, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=851.04s)]
*  right? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=856.9599999999999s)]
*  In other words, you've got a psychological stage that's got to be overcome before we [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=858.44s)]
*  allow a person to enter into the political world of adult relations. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=864.0400000000001s)]
*  And the degree to which we successfully repress or find substitutes to carry us past that [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=869.6400000000001s)]
*  stage and what forms those substitutes end up taking, that both draws from and creates [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=874.2800000000001s)]
*  the content of our culture. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=882.34s)]
*  Think for example, just of how much effort we put in, especially when you think of the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=886.32s)]
*  self-conscious mores of the upper classes or the middle classes who imitate them. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=891.7600000000001s)]
*  Think of how much effort we put in to making eating, eating a meal, as unlike what it actually [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=896.48s)]
*  is as possible. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=902.9200000000001s)]
*  And eating is what we're here to talk about. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=905.88s)]
*  So we're here to talk about cannibalism. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=907.4000000000001s)]
*  So let's get into it. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=909.44s)]
*  The first thing that I really need to do at the outset here is to define the scope of [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=912.1s)]
*  what it is I'm trying to do. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=916.3000000000001s)]
*  This is not going to be a broad survey of every type and instance of cannibalism that's [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=917.74s)]
*  ever existed. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=922.82s)]
*  I'm trying to go narrow and deep. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=923.82s)]
*  We're not going to talk about cannibalism born out of desperation. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=927.38s)]
*  We're not interested here in the aberrant acts of a few psychotics. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=930.86s)]
*  The fascination that stories about cannibalism from the Donner Party or Hannibal Lecter, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=934.82s)]
*  the fascination that those stories have for us does tell us something. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=940.62s)]
*  There's information there, but the violation that they represent, the fact of the violation [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=943.58s)]
*  is part of the fascination. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=948.86s)]
*  These aren't acts that enjoy general social approval. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=952.08s)]
*  In these next two episodes, this one here on cannibalism and the next one on sacrifice, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=955.78s)]
*  are about social violence, institutionalized violence that everyone or almost everyone [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=961.14s)]
*  in a society either accepts as legitimate or at least doesn't consider it worth energetically [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=966.26s)]
*  opposing. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=972.14s)]
*  I have heard people raise the question whether something like car accident deaths in the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=973.14s)]
*  modern world can be classified as a type of sacrifice to some abstract god of convenience [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=978.54s)]
*  or economics. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=984.38s)]
*  What they'll say is that we can predict with close accuracy how many people are going to [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=987.14s)]
*  and the next year and the next year on into the future from car accidents. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=992.1s)]
*  And so if we know with apodictic certainty that about 30,000 people are going to die [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=997.0600000000001s)]
*  in vehicles next year and that highway driving is essentially a game of chicken where we [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1002.74s)]
*  all compete to see who's going to draw those 30,000 short straws, how is that not a sacrifice? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1007.7s)]
*  And fine, whatever. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1014.34s)]
*  I get the point. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1015.34s)]
*  I guess it makes sense if you're interested in the statistics of it, but despite the best [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1016.74s)]
*  efforts of Ballard and Cronenberg, nobody's constructing a cultural system out of car [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1021.74s)]
*  accidents and their victims. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1026.06s)]
*  Of course, most drivers don't die in car accidents, just as most people in Mesoamerica were not [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1029.38s)]
*  sacrificed and eaten. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1034.06s)]
*  And when it does happen, in any case, it's the killers, not the victims, who actually [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1035.74s)]
*  remain behind to act in the world and to apprehend and interpret what they've done. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1042.42s)]
*  But that's about where the parallels end between those two things. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1049.6200000000001s)]
*  I get where they're coming from, but I don't like it as an example. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1052.3000000000002s)]
*  You know, a modern person who kills another person in an auto accident might end up in [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1055.9s)]
*  therapy for years and even then is not likely to ever be completely whole again. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1060.14s)]
*  But I'm not aware of any king's torturers or executioners ending up in therapy, unless [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1067.66s)]
*  you count confession, which maybe we should, I suppose. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1072.5400000000002s)]

*  I was recently listening to a psychologist lecture about post-traumatic stress disorder, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1278.72s)]
*  He was talking about how people can just as easily be afflicted with PTSD after doing [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1285.96s)]
*  something horrific as they can from witnessing something horrific, or having something horrific [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1291.24s)]
*  happen to themselves or to someone close to them. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1296.4s)]
*  And now, obviously I'm not a psychologist, but I think I can say with some confidence [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1300.68s)]
*  that there's some cultural relativity clearly at play here. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1305.96s)]
*  If a modern person, and not any person, but a volunteer soldier in a society that values [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1310.72s)]
*  and honors its soldiers and gives them a lot of leeway as we do for decisions that they [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1316.28s)]
*  make on the battlefield, if somebody like that can suffer from PTSD just because he [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1321.82s)]
*  got too trigger happy in a wild firefight and ended up taking out a civilian at a distance, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1327.96s)]
*  and this does happen, people do get PTSD from things like that, you would expect pretty [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1332.72s)]
*  much every single society before about the 19th century, so the whole human species to [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1339.06s)]

*  unhesitating violence of the world. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1372.94s)]
*  Just think of what life is, not this or that life form, but just life in general, think [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1377.18s)]
*  about what it is, about how nature proceeded through the eons. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1381.8200000000002s)]
*  For a really, really long time there was no life, right, it was just for most of the history [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1387.78s)]
*  of the universe, there's no life, it's just inert matter. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1393.02s)]
*  Billions of years when just chemistry and physics matter, and if you would have shown [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1396.66s)]
*  up back then and asked somebody about biology, they would not have known what the fuck you [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1401.66s)]
*  were talking about, because there was no biology, right? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1405.7s)]
*  And then at some point, who knows why, some of that inert matter started self-organizing, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1409.58s)]
*  at least that's what I'm told by people who are way smarter than I am, and what did these [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1417.3799999999999s)]
*  little self-organizing proto-life forms start doing pretty much as soon as they existed? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1421.9s)]
*  They looked around at each other and immediately started tearing one another apart, eating [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1427.44s)]
*  each other, and then using the energy that they absorbed from eating each other to reproduce [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1433.26s)]
*  copies of themselves. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1437.8200000000002s)]
*  And then for a really, really long time, that's all there was to it, that's what happened, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1441.38s)]
*  that's just all there was, but over time these little buggers kept inventing new ways to [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1445.7s)]
*  kill and eat each other, and new ways to avoid being killed and eaten. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1451.38s)]
*  Now up here at the macro level of large mammals and other megafauna like ourselves, it's easy [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1456.74s)]
*  to forget sometimes what an absolute fucking nightmare life is at the microscopic level, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1462.46s)]
*  or in places like the ocean, for example. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1469.1000000000001s)]
*  There's this really unbelievable scene in Werner Herzog's documentary, Encounters at [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1472.18s)]
*  the End of the World, where he's talking to a biologist about, well, he and a biologist [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1477.82s)]
*  are talking about this subject exactly at a research station down in Antarctica, and [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1483.78s)]
*  the biologist is describing to Herzog what kind of creatures are found in the water under [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1489.86s)]
*  the ice, and what life is like at the microscopic level down there. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1494.34s)]
*  And this guy, this biologist, he's very serious as he's speaking, you know, he's not joking [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1499.6s)]
*  around. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1506.6s)]
*  He seems, I almost said he seems disturbed, but it's not that. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1507.6s)]
*  He seems chastened. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1514.24s)]
*  He has the chastened look of a man who has seen something fundamental about the world [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1515.48s)]
*  that he would probably like to forget if he could, but he can't. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1520.12s)]
*  The creatures that are down there, he says, are like science fiction creatures. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1525.12s)]
*  They range in the way, I'm quoting him now, they range in the way they would gobble [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1532.1599999999999s)]
*  you up from slime type blobs, but creepier than science fiction type blobs. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1536.58s)]
*  These would have long tendrils that would ensnare you, and as you try to get away from [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1542.98s)]
*  them, you just become more and more ensnared by your own actions. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1547.54s)]
*  And then after you would be frustrated and exhausted, then this creature would start [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1552.46s)]
*  to move in and take you apart. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1558.06s)]
*  When you watch him describe this, he's kind of looking away from the camera, and the look [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1561.98s)]
*  on his face, I swear to God, it looks like he's looking at the murder scene right in [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1566.14s)]
*  front of him. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1570.18s)]
*  And so he goes on. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1571.18s)]
*  Then there are these other worm type things with horrible mandibles and jaws and just [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1573.0600000000002s)]
*  bits to rend your flesh. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1580.5800000000002s)]
*  It is a horrible, it really is a horribly violent world that is obscure to us because [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1584.18s)]
*  We're encased in neoprene and we're much larger than that world, but if you were to shrink [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1593.0400000000002s)]
*  down, miniaturize into that, into that world, it would be a horrible place to be, just horrible. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1598.0400000000002s)]
*  And so this biologist is so caught up in this vision of brutality, you don't want to interrupt [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1607.7600000000002s)]
*  them. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1613.7600000000002s)]
*  And I think Herzog is the only filmmaker alive who could probably keep the interview moving [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1614.7600000000002s)]
*  at this point. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1618.0400000000002s)]
*  And so he asks the biologist, he says, and this world is a world earlier than the human [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1619.6s)]
*  world. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1626.24s)]
*  Do you think that the human race and other mammals fled in panic from the oceans and [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1627.24s)]
*  crawled on solid land to get out of all this? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1632.8799999999999s)]
*  And the biologist is already nodding his head. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1636.36s)]
*  He says, yes, I think undoubtedly, unquestionably, that is the driving force that caused us to [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1638.3999999999999s)]
*  leave the horrors behind, to grow and evolve into larger creatures, to escape what's horribly [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1643.48s)]
*  violent at the miniature scale. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1649.0s)]
*  End quote. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1651.44s)]
*  I love that, you know, because there's truth in it. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1652.44s)]
*  Life begins billions of years ago, life begins and just immediately starts devouring itself. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1657.88s)]
*  And evolution is the process of life running, screaming away from other life and hiding [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1665.34s)]
*  from it in any form that it can think of. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1670.72s)]
*  From our humble beginnings, you know, we stampeded through every exit we could find until one [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1675.1s)]
*  thing led to another. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1681.5s)]
*  And we've got ducks and platypi and duck-billed platypi and all types of shit running around. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1682.5s)]
*  But no matter what happens, no matter what form they take, one thing remains. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1688.8s)]
*  All of that matter that decided to start self organizing and consuming energy to hold that [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1696.02s)]
*  pattern over time, all that stuff that is still subject to physics, even as it defies [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1700.9s)]
*  gravity to lift itself off the ground, that's still subject to all the laws of chemistry, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1706.94s)]
*  even though it has sort of begun to sidestep some of their consequences by incorporating [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1712.26s)]
*  them in, you know, specific combinations to create energy. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1717.02s)]
*  All that stuff that we call life, with a few exceptions, is pretty much a closed loop. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1720.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, you can't eat a rock. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1728.78s)]
*  Life eats life, and that's all there is to it. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1730.54s)]
*  More complex creatures like ourselves, I mean, think about what it takes just to keep us [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1735.26s)]
*  moving. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1740.26s)]
*  Think about how many cows and chickens and pigs, how many fish, how many pounds of wheat [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1741.86s)]
*  and rice and fruit and everything else. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1746.18s)]
*  Think of how much it takes just to keep one human child from collapsing and dying of starvation [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1748.78s)]
*  and becoming a pile of rotting goo for just one year. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1755.26s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1759.1s)]
*  The earliest forms of life used chemical and photosynthetic energy to replicate themselves. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1761.98s)]
*  Those replicas began eating each other, taking on more complex and clever forms to ensure [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1768.7s)]
*  that they were the eaters and not the eaten. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1773.06s)]
*  And then again, for billions of years, you know, like we said, that's how things went. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1776.06s)]
*  You've got a new set of laws, laws of evolutionary biology, but we're running according to law. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1779.9s)]
*  And it's amazing. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1788.02s)]
*  You know, we proliferate. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1789.02s)]
*  You've got 130-foot-long dinosaurs for a while. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1790.02s)]
*  You know, plankton's been around for a really long time, so of course life has had plenty [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1793.5800000000002s)]
*  of time to figure out and evolve this big vacuum cleaner-like thing, like the blue whale [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1797.74s)]
*  that just swims around, efficiently sucking it up. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1802.66s)]
*  We've got crustaceans that haven't had to change much in a few hundred million years, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1806.46s)]
*  but through it all, the essence of the thing never changes. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1811.26s)]
*  See past the forms, look behind the curtain, behind all the disguises that life uses to [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1816.9s)]
*  hide from and ambush itself. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1821.66s)]
*  The entire production takes place in a butchery, a slaughterhouse. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1825.14s)]
*  Plants absorb sunlight from above and chemicals from below, and then, you know, you've got [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1831.9s)]
*  a few chemotrophs here and there sucking up minerals that the earth gives off. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1835.74s)]
*  But other than the energy pouring into the biosphere from those two unconscious portals, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1839.3s)]
*  everything else lives by killing and eating. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1845.1s)]
*  Billions of years of just chasing each other down, tearing each other apart, breaking each [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1849.3s)]
*  other down, and saying, you know, you are no longer, you were no longer you, you are [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1855.1s)]
*  now a part of me. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1861.94s)]
*  So killing and eating is the first and the most complete form in which domination can [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1866.66s)]
*  be expressed. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1871.38s)]
*  But then something else happened. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1875.06s)]
*  One of those creatures, for reasons that we will speculate about as the series goes on, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1878.8600000000001s)]
*  one of those creatures began to wake up and look around. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1886.3s)]
*  Because see, there are lots of ways to be dominant in this world, at least in various [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1889.46s)]
*  parts of it, right? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1895.58s)]
*  If Velociraptors made a comeback right before we split off from chimps and bonobos, we might [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1896.82s)]
*  all be speaking dinosaur today, but they didn't. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1903.1s)]
*  And so about six million years ago, our species embarked upon an evolutionary journey that, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1905.6999999999998s)]
*  you know, uses the energy that would normally go into things like skull-crushing jaws or, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1912.3s)]
*  you know, cheetah sprinting legs, and instead put that energy into this big brain that can [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1917.26s)]
*  do things like calculate the trajectory of a spear in the wind or build a habitat-specific [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1922.34s)]
*  shelter or, you know, lay complicated ambushes adapted to the environment and the prey and [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1927.8999999999999s)]
*  the number of killers you've got available. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1934.5s)]
*  And so instead of being forced to adapt to every single change in our environment, we [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1937.22s)]
*  dampen those changes. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1941.58s)]
*  And within certain constraints, we even make the environment adapt to us. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1943.4199999999998s)]
*  If Velociraptors made a comeback tomorrow, I mean, we'd put them all in zoos and take [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1948.42s)]
*  our children to see them. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1954.22s)]
*  The difference between animals and humans is that there's very little that separates [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1957.8600000000001s)]
*  what an animal is from what it does. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1964.18s)]
*  I mean, a plant is what it does. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1966.5800000000002s)]
*  It's a pattern of organic matter that uses photosynthesis to manifest in a particular [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1970.7s)]
*  way. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1976.5s)]
*  That is what it does. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1978.3s)]
*  A fish is a little more complicated. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1981.62s)]
*  You know, it's a persistent pattern of organic matter with a series of reflexes and motor [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1984.1399999999999s)]
*  abilities to seek out and incorporate its preferred energy sources. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1988.22s)]
*  A lion is still a pretty well-oiled machine, pretty dialed in with pretty much every feature [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1993.6s)]
*  and bit of energy going into being a lion. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=1999.78s)]
*  But now you're starting to see a little something else going on. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2003.78s)]
*  Something you don't recognize in fish and certainly not in plants. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2007.88s)]
*  You take a cat and you put it in the wild and it's a pretty straightforward creature, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2012.68s)]
*  which is understandable. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2016.64s)]
*  A human and a famine becomes a pretty straightforward creature too. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2017.64s)]
*  But if you give us or a cat a little bit of room to catch our breath, suddenly we're full [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2021.2s)]
*  of surprises, right? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2027.2800000000002s)]
*  Human beings are not really custom-made machines the way most animals are. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2030.5400000000002s)]
*  There's a big space between what we are and what we do, between impulse and action. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2034.44s)]
*  And that gap, I think, is maybe what we call consciousness. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2039.76s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2043.3200000000002s)]
*  So freedom isn't free, of course, though, right? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2044.76s)]
*  And consciousness comes with a cost. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2048.2000000000003s)]
*  And that cost is not negligible. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2050.52s)]
*  We've constructed entire cultures and civilizations to help us deal with the fallout from having [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2054.7400000000002s)]
*  stepped out of nature and waking up into this nightmare. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2061.44s)]
*  For one thing, we look around. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2067.84s)]
*  Unlike any other animal, we have to look around and see what's been going on all this time [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2069.96s)]
*  while nobody but God was paying attention. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2074.68s)]
*  This is the vision of Job in the whirlwind or of Arjuna's vision when Krishna takes on [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2078.6s)]
*  his infinite form in the Bhagavad Gita. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2083.92s)]
*  Those are two archetypes that help us illustrate a very basic human dilemma, waking up to [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2087.2s)]
*  what kind of world it is that we've been thrust into and coming to understand our own complicity [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2093.0s)]
*  in this ongoing mass murder. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2099.2s)]
*  In Sam Keen's introduction to Ernest Becker's great book, The Denial of Death, he kind of [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2103.4199999999996s)]
*  describes it well. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2108.16s)]
*  He says, quote, The world is terrifying. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2109.16s)]
*  Other nature is a brutal bitch, red in tooth and claw, who destroys what she creates. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2113.28s)]
*  We live in a creation in which the routine activity for organisms is tearing others apart [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2119.28s)]
*  with teeth of all types, biting, grinding flesh, plant stalks, bones between molars, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2124.6000000000004s)]
*  pushing the pulp greedily down the gullet with delight, incorporating its essence into [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2131.0400000000004s)]
*  one's own organization and then excreting with foul stenching gases the residue. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2135.5400000000004s)]
*  End quote. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2140.44s)]
*  Many of us naturally have a few questions about the design of this whole thing and what [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2144.2400000000002s)]
*  exactly it's supposed to be for. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2148.7200000000003s)]
*  The psychologist R.D. Lang, Ronald Lang in his book The Politics of Experience, describes [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2152.6800000000003s)]
*  the experience of a schizophrenic with whom he was familiar. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2158.88s)]
*  The schizophrenic patient had the absolutely subjectively certain experience of sitting [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2163.1600000000003s)]
*  on his bed as his house burned around him. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2171.64s)]
*  The house had two stories and then an attic above that, and in the attic was God, and [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2175.8399999999997s)]
*  God was a madman, always and forever screaming and raving because he alone had full knowledge [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2180.7999999999997s)]
*  of what the world really was about. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2187.04s)]
*  In the Bible, Job, we mentioned a second ago, Job is afflicted by various sufferings and [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2191.48s)]
*  tragedies despite being a righteous man. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2198.72s)]
*  Coming out of a tribal honor culture, Job, even like many of us still today, expected [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2202.9199999999996s)]
*  that there should be some kind of reciprocity in his dealing with God, or with the universe, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2208.04s)]
*  if you like. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2213.0s)]
*  I haven't done anything, he insisted. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2214.0s)]
*  This is not fair. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2216.04s)]
*  What did I do to deserve any of this? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2217.24s)]
*  His friends come along and they sort of run through the various theological arguments [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2220.0s)]
*  that were being made at the time. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2225.12s)]
*  They were all insisting that what happens to us in the world is always a result of our [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2227.32s)]
*  own righteousness or unrighteousness, that however it seems to us, God is just. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2231.32s)]
*  And so there is this reciprocity to it, but of course we already know what his friends [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2237.56s)]
*  don't know, that despite everything that's befallen him, Job is a righteous man, because [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2241.6400000000003s)]
*  the story told us so right up front. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2246.84s)]
*  And so Job, to his credit, refuses to accept any of their arguments. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2249.88s)]
*  He insists on his blamelessness, and he essentially demands an audience with God. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2254.2599999999998s)]
*  He wants God to come before him so that he can make his case and get an explanation out [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2259.66s)]
*  of God for why all these terrible things have happened to him. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2263.54s)]
*  He never curses God, as his resentful wife implores him to do, but he refuses to say [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2267.46s)]
*  what he does not believe is true, that he somehow deserves all of this. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2272.48s)]
*  And so finally, the end of the book, after this ruined man, poor Job, is left covered [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2278.06s)]
*  in sores with a dead family, all his cattle and sheep and goats and goods taken away, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2285.82s)]
*  sitting in a pile of ashes where his house used to be. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2293.62s)]
*  God comes on the scene in one of the great pieces of world spiritual literature. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2297.94s)]
*  His message to Job, as spectacular and overwhelming as its imagery, is very simple. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2304.66s)]
*  He tells Job that he's right. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2309.96s)]
*  He doesn't deserve any of this. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2311.6s)]
*  But what gave Job, or anybody, the idea that deserve has anything to do with what happens [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2315.44s)]
*  to anyone or anything in this universe? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2322.18s)]
*  God appears in a whirlwind. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2326.46s)]
*  He takes Job up into the whirlwind. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2328.02s)]
*  He says to Job, you've made demands and questioned me, and now it is I who will question you. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2330.7s)]
*  What exactly do you think this place is, Job? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2336.8999999999996s)]
*  Who told you that this was a safe space? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2341.1s)]
*  What in all of your experience of this world made you think that that's how things work? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2345.1s)]
*  Does the gazelle deserve to be ripped to pieces by a lion? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2352.8599999999997s)]
*  Does it deserve to be ripped to pieces by you for that matter? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2357.22s)]
*  From the book of Job God speaks, quote, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2362.22s)]
*  Hast thou given the war horse his strength? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2366.02s)]
*  Was it thee who clothed his neck with thunder? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2368.8199999999997s)]
*  Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2372.4599999999996s)]
*  The fury of his nostrils is terrible. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2374.66s)]
*  Behold how he stampeth and paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2379.0s)]
*  As he is charging on to meet the armed men, he mocketh fear and is not affrighted, neither turneth he back from the sword. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2384.1s)]
*  The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2391.1s)]
*  He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2394.9s)]
*  Neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2398.2999999999997s)]
*  He sayeth among the trumpets, ha ha! [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2401.2999999999997s)]
*  And he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains and the shouting. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2403.7s)]
*  Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2409.14s)]
*  Doth the eagle mount up at thy command and make her nest on high? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2414.14s)]
*  She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, in the strong place. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2419.14s)]
*  From thence she seeketh prey, and her eyes behold afar off. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2424.46s)]
*  Her young ones also suck up blood, and where the slain are, there is she, end quote. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2428.9s)]
*  Everything in this world has been tearing and clawing and killing from the beginning of time. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2436.7000000000003s)]
*  And what, Job? I'm just supposed to call the whole thing off? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2444.7000000000003s)]
*  Because why? Because the process finally landed on your doorstep? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2448.7000000000003s)]
*  She... [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2452.7000000000003s)]
*  Does Job have any idea how this works? Tell me all about it, Job. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2454.7000000000003s)]
*  Were you there when I set the stars in motion and hung the earth in place? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2458.7000000000003s)]
*  No, you weren't. And you don't have any idea of the questions you're even asking me, let alone what the answers to them are. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2462.7s)]
*  And now, today, we might look at this and say, well, this is awfully mean of God, but it's mean of the universe. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2469.7s)]
*  This is life. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2476.7s)]
*  If you've ever lost anyone close to you unexpectedly, you know what I mean when I say that there's a random inhumanity to this world. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2478.7s)]
*  You know, our minds are robust, adaptable devices for making that chaos somewhat livable. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2487.7s)]
*  People can say that the ways that we do come up with to live lives of apparent order in a world of swirling, ravenous chaos, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2495.7s)]
*  that it's all just human delusions or opiates of the masses, and fine, yeah, fine, there's something to that, but it's also the glory of our species. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2503.7s)]
*  That gazelle in the lion's mouth is just a piece of meat, which is all any of us are when we're stripped of meaning. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2512.7s)]
*  If you want an idea of what it's like to live that way, go read Lovecraft when he's at his best, or read Thomas Lugatti's Conspiracy Against the Human Race. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2521.7s)]
*  Lugatti's a horror author, a great horror author in the vein of H.P. Lovecraft, but his power to unseat and discomfort us comes not just from good, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2531.7s)]
*  suspenseful pacing of his stories or from well-conceived monsters, but from his vivid and often emotionally devastating vision of what life is when it's stripped of meaning. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2542.7s)]
*  In Conspiracy Against the Human Race, a nonfiction book that he wrote just to address some of these ideas directly, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2556.7s)]
*  he describes how the most mundane and unthreatening objects can become uncannily horrific if you stare at them long enough to let your attachments of meaning fall away, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2562.7s)]
*  kind of the way that repeating a word over and over and over and over soon turns it into a meaningless babbling of syllables, I don't know if you've ever done that. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2574.7s)]
*  This is Lugatti, quote, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2582.7s)]
*  familiar. And it is then that the question, why should there be something rather than nothing, may become lost in the inexplicable, even preposterous ambition to resolve it without losing our minds to the uncanny. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2613.7s)]
*  Everyday objects seem curiously liable to being perceived as uncanny because we see them every day and know how they should be and should not be. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2628.7s)]
*  One day those shoes on the floor of your closet may attract your eye in a way that they never have before. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2638.7s)]
*  Somehow they've become abstracted from your world, appearances you cannot place, just lumps of matter without any fixed quality and meaning. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2646.7s)]
*  You feel confused as you stare at them. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2656.7s)]
*  What are they? What is their nature? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2659.7s)]
*  Why should there be something rather than nothing at all? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2662.7s)]
*  But before your consciousness can ask any more questions, you dial it back so that your footwear seems familiar again and not uncanny in its being. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2666.7s)]
*  You select a pair of shoes to wear that day and sit down to put them on. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2675.7s)]
*  It's then that you notice the pair of stockings you're wearing and think of the feet that they conceal and the rest of the body to which those concealed feet are connected. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2679.7s)]
*  In the universe in which that body is roving about with so many other uncanny shapes, what now? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2689.7s)]
*  A voice from the other side of being seems to say. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2697.7s)]
*  And what if you should look at yourself, the most everyday object there is, and feel at a loss to attach a quality and a meaning to what is being seeing or what is seeing it? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2700.7s)]
*  What now, indeed, is the meaning of the word? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2713.7s)]
*  What now, indeed? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2716.7s)]
*  See, he's not looking at his leg or his foot as the limb of a human being with a family situated in a cultural context, in a historical moment, and so forth. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2721.7s)]
*  Suddenly he's looking at that leg as, well, he's seeing it the way that a cannibal would see it. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2733.7s)]
*  See, I remember where we were going with this. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2740.7s)]
*  We're going to get deep into the mythology and the theology that the Aztecs built around this stuff as we go through this series, but we can't start there. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2742.7s)]
*  We've got to back up. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2751.7s)]
*  All that's very important, and we're going to have to talk a lot about it to get an idea of how the Aztecs understood what they were doing, but it won't tell us why they were doing it. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2753.7s)]
*  I mean, how could it? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2763.7s)]
*  Like a growing child, human groups are always already caught up in the world of action before it ever occurs to them to have to explain any of it to themselves. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2765.7s)]
*  The explanations that men come up with for something like ritual cannibalism vary within a few broad categories, but first we need to focus on the act itself. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2775.7s)]
*  So a lot of popular books that you'll find on cannibalism begin similarly with a survey of cannibalistic behavior in animals, and then they might spend some time asking what we really mean by cannibalism, and whether eating your boogers or some hippie chick frying up her afterbirth after giving birth counts. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2784.7s)]
*  I don't care about any of that. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2805.7s)]
*  I don't care what the Donner Party did. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2806.7s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about what happened in some famine. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2808.7s)]
*  People trapped in the snow or stuck in a famine who eat human flesh, those people find themselves in the world that Ligati was just describing. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2811.7s)]
*  Crazed with hunger, meanings drop away, and suddenly a human leg is reduced to a human body. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2820.7s)]
*  Although, to be honest, even then I would bet that it takes a measure of ritual to turn the leg into a drumstick. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2826.7s)]
*  You can imagine members of the Donner Party in a circle praying for permission or forgiveness before the human could be reduced to meat. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2832.7s)]
*  But even still, that's not what we're here to talk about. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2841.7s)]
*  I'm talking about cannibalism as part of a cultural system practiced by people who are not starving in a manner that enjoys social legitimacy. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2844.7s)]
*  Sacrificing cannibalism are forms of institutionalized aggression. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2854.7s)]
*  This is one of the first things to know and understand, one of the foundations upon which any serious understanding of human life is required. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2859.7s)]
*  And I'm not going to talk about cannibalism as a political system. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2868.7s)]
*  I'm going to talk about cannibalism as a political system. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2872.7s)]
*  I'm going to talk about cannibalism as a political system. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2875.7s)]
*  Do not imagine that it is possible to cut into another living man's chest to extract his still beating heart, except as an act of aggression. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2879.7s)]
*  Do not imagine that it is possible to cut into another living man's chest to extract his still beating heart, except as an act of aggression. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2887.7s)]
*  The formality of the ritual structures, you know, that structures the aggression, disguises it. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2898.7s)]
*  But aggression is the rippling energy that drives that knife into the flesh. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2906.7s)]
*  And all societies have forms of institutionalized aggression because all societies are full of individuals who experience aggression all the time. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2911.7s)]
*  Things like sexual and aggressive energies, these are primary human motivations that drive our individual and collective lives. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2920.7s)]
*  But every society has got to find ways to manage the sexual and aggressive impulses of its members. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2929.7s)]
*  Doing so is a big part of what makes us human. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2936.7s)]
*  I mean, you think like all these years after an Iron Age tribe of desert nomads inscribed their Ten Commandments on some tablets, things like thou shalt not murder, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, they still hold up pretty well. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2940.7s)]
*  Because in order to sustain certain modes of social life, people have got to figure out how, for example, to ensure against stuff like this. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2955.7s)]
*  Quote, what follows is a matter of fact, not fiction, a matter of history, not of legend. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2963.7s)]
*  Princess Luede was the niece of Mutesa, king of Buganda, 1856 to 84. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2972.7s)]
*  Buganda is the largest kingdom discovered by the British around Lake Victoria and East Africa. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2978.7s)]
*  It's like modern-day Uganda, as you probably guessed. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2983.7s)]
*  So, where am I? Yeah. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2987.7s)]
*  She had been given as a wife to Prime Minister Mokassa by Mutesa as a reward for the minister's good services. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2990.7s)]
*  They had two children together. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2997.7s)]
*  One day, as was the custom with female members of the royal family, Princess Luede paid a visit to Princess Sansanse, a senior member of the family. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=2999.7s)]
*  Princess Luede found the company being entertained by Kalemba, a comely youth who was amusing those assembled with music on the harp. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3008.7s)]
*  The youth, his youth, the harp, his singing were all too much for the only two human princess. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3015.7s)]
*  Prime Minister's wife that she was, and she became dangerously infatuated with Kalemba, regarding him as the most charming young man she had ever seen. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3021.7s)]
*  Knowing nothing of Puritan restraint, Princess Luede confessed her need and desire to Princess Sansanse, who assured her cousin that arrangements would be made for the lovers to meet in private. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3029.7s)]
*  We are not told of Kalemba's feelings, but presumably he could not refuse such an offer from a woman of high rank, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3040.7s)]
*  and he must have known beforehand the risks and rewards of such beautiful singing and harp playing. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3047.7s)]
*  Several days later, Princess Sansanse, with seven other women, and with the youth Kalemba dressed as a woman, all proceeded to the house of Princess Luede and the Prime Minister's compound. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3052.7s)]
*  Each of the visitors carried a parcel of food, that being the public purpose of the visit. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3063.7s)]
*  Overjoyed at the success of the stratagem, Princess Luede sequestered Kalemba in her hut, and they spent several days obliterating the distinction between day and night. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3068.7s)]
*  Getting Kalemba out of the Prime Minister's compound proved more difficult than getting him in. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3078.7s)]
*  Questioning one of Luede's companions, Mukasa discerned the truth of the matter. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3083.7s)]
*  Luede's house was pulled down. After most of the grass had been removed, the harpist was found hiding under the last thin layer. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3088.7s)]
*  Both Kalemba and Luede were brought before the Prime Minister, who was surrounded by followers sure to assent to whatever judgment he gave. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3096.7s)]
*  Luede confessed her fault, asserting that she had been helpless in the face of the youth's exceptional beauty and asked for mercy. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3104.7s)]
*  Kalemba, however, struck the arrogant pose of the conqueror who has himself been conquered. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3112.7s)]
*  He asserted that he had been perfectly aware of the risks he had hazarded and was prepared to take the consequences. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3118.7s)]
*  Kalemba's arrogance infuriated Mukasa. He ordered the youth's head cut off and given to Luede. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3124.7s)]
*  His blood was to be smeared all over her head and dress. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3130.7s)]
*  There was no court to appeal such a verdict from the Prime Minister. His executioners carried out the sentence. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3134.7s)]
*  The Prime Minister was so caught up in his own cruelty that at first he insisted Luede carry her lover's head with her when she went back to her father, the king, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3140.7s)]
*  although his subordinates prevailed upon him to forego such a dangerous royal insult. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3150.7s)]
*  That was the author Eli Sagan's rendering of a first-hand account provided by British explorers. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3155.7s)]
*  So see, that's why you got to have rules about when aggression is okay, what types of aggression are okay, who should sleep with whom and under what circumstances. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3163.7s)]
*  You got to have rules like this. It's either that or Hieronymus Bosch. Those are the options. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3175.7s)]
*  These rules are associated with more advanced forms of social life for a reason. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3180.7s)]
*  And if it seems like high civilization, if it sometimes seems like high civilization has fewer rules than more primitive societies, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3188.7s)]
*  that's only because most of the rules that we live our lives by aren't explicit. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3198.7s)]
*  They're deeply embedded at the level of habit and custom and self-evident common sense, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3202.7s)]
*  and you don't necessarily know where the boundaries are until you step over one. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3207.7s)]
*  Now all societies have forms of institutionalized aggression, but the more direct and literal expressions of it are almost always found at very primitive levels of social development. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3211.7s)]
*  And throughout this, throughout the rest of this series and anytime, I'm not using primitive as a pejorative here. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3223.7s)]
*  I mean it in the sense that relates that word primitive to the word primary. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3230.7s)]
*  You know, it's an antecedent stage of our advanced complex societies. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3234.7s)]
*  One of the reasons that the Aztecs are so fascinating is that they maintained these bloody practices, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3240.7s)]
*  just unbelievably bloody sacrifices and cannibalism and everything long past the stage when most societies have given them up. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3247.7s)]
*  You know, there's no evidence of institutionalized cannibalism in the ancient hieratic city-states of Egypt and Mesopotamia, for example. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3257.7s)]
*  And the Aztecs were at least as advanced as those societies, very arguably more, but at least as advanced as them. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3266.7s)]
*  On the other hand, we have very extensive evidence of cannibalism throughout Africa, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3273.7s)]
*  through the islands running from the Indian out into the Pacific Oceans and all throughout the New World. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3279.7s)]
*  Polynesia actually provides a really interesting case study of sort of the general point I'm trying to make, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3285.7s)]
*  because in the pre-contact Pacific Islands, there were all these isolated societies developing kind of in their own way [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3291.7s)]
*  that were able to rank in terms of social complexity and political development from Stone Age tribes all the way up to the Hawaiians, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3300.7s)]
*  which, you know, Hawaii was arguably a state and certainly seemed to be on its way to being a state at least. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3308.7s)]
*  And what you find in those places where European explorers encountered societies practicing cannibalism, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3314.7s)]
*  the rule was that it was engaged in most directly and most frequently the lower down the scale of development you go. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3321.7s)]
*  Now, as you go through the literature around cannibalism, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3329.7s)]
*  one of the inescapable facts that you realize right off the bat very quickly is that a human being can never be reduced entirely to meat. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3335.7s)]
*  Try as we might to dehumanize and objectify other people, some part of us always recognizes them. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3346.7s)]
*  That's why it takes an act of aggression to hurt them. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3354.7s)]
*  It doesn't take an act of aggression to step on an ant. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3358.7s)]
*  It takes a little bit more to gut a fish. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3361.7s)]
*  It takes enough aggression to strangle a puppy that if a kid does it, we send him to an army of psychologists and keep a close eye on him. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3364.7s)]
*  It's usually a him. We are talking about aggression after all. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3371.7s)]
*  And we do that because we know somehow, even if we haven't seen the statistics, that anybody can kill an ant. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3374.7s)]
*  But it's not that much of a leap for somebody to ignore the panicked, pleading cries of a puppy and for that same person to show a similar lack of empathy for you or me. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3382.7s)]
*  At some level, we understand that. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3392.7s)]
*  And yet, you know, neither of us had ants for breakfast this morning. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3395.7s)]
*  Most of us in the last week have eaten something that if we had to kill it up close ourselves by hand, would at least take a few minutes of mental preparation. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3400.7s)]
*  Have you ever petted a lamb, a little lamb? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3411.7s)]
*  They're freaking adorable. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3414.7s)]
*  I mean, guess what? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3417.7s)]
*  You know, they don't just lay lamb chops like chickens lay eggs. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3419.7s)]
*  You know, you don't just walk around the lamb farm and find shanks and chops lying around all over the place. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3423.7s)]
*  No, somebody had to had to grab that little guy and club him over the head or cut his throat, cut him open, rip out his guts, cut him to pieces and send those pieces to your local supermarket. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3428.7s)]
*  The hesitation that many of you would feel at one or another step in that process, that is a modern luxury. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3440.7s)]
*  Until very, very recently, pretty much everybody had to be at least prepared to kill something. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3447.7s)]
*  You're alive today because 10,000 generations of your human ancestors and an inconceivable number of your evolutionary ancestors did not hesitate. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3455.7s)]
*  The Tigarian people of New Guinea, they were a particularly nasty little bunch, savage, warlike, incredibly cruel. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3467.7s)]
*  They were kind of like proto Vikings. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3477.7s)]
*  Actually, they they would terrorize more peaceful villages along the coast west of the Baxter River there in New Guinea. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3479.7s)]
*  And what they would do was what they would do is they build these long canoes and they would take them on expeditions along the coast and up the rivers like Vikings. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3485.7s)]
*  And they would just plunder and steal and slaughter people and take slaves. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3495.7s)]
*  And when they would take these slaves, these prisoners, they would keep them on the canoes with them because they would stay out on these raiding expeditions for months at a time without staying in one place. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3500.7s)]
*  And so they would keep them for food. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3509.7s)]
*  They would break their arms and legs and just leave them there so that they couldn't escape. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3512.7s)]
*  And yet they would keep them alive so that when they needed meat, they could just lop off an arm or lop off a foot or a lower leg from one of these mobile meat lockers that they kept. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3516.7s)]
*  So that's just one end of it, right? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3526.7s)]
*  That's one of the more primitive and non symbolic looking examples of regularized cannibalism that you're going to find. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3528.7s)]
*  But even here, even something just like that, where it looks like just there's no difference between humans and, you know, any other any other human beings. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3534.7s)]
*  Any other food that they happen to gather up. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3545.7s)]
*  Even here, the use of human meat was set about with taboos and superstitions and rituals that you had to perform before you could eat it. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3548.7s)]
*  And, you know, all these things, rules just very clearly. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3555.7s)]
*  They know the difference and they're maintaining the difference ritualistically. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3560.7s)]
*  Very often cannibalistic rituals would involve the entire community. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3566.7s)]
*  Here's a Polynesian example provided by a Scottish missionary of women following their men into battle. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3571.7s)]
*  And the women would go in as the men were fighting and they would stay just behind the battle line as the fighting raged. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3578.7s)]
*  Whenever they see one of the enemy fall, it is their business to rush forward, pull the body behind and dress it for the oven. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3601.7s)]
*  The hands are the choice bits, sacred to the priests. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3609.7s)]
*  The priests go to the battle, but sit in the distance fasting and praying for victory. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3612.7s)]
*  If the body of a chief is cooked, everyone must partake down to the little child. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3617.7s)]
*  And before a Gormandizer proceeds to polish the bones, he calls out, have all tasted? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3622.7s)]
*  If it is the body of a woman, they eat only the arms and the legs. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3628.7s)]
*  On mare they devour all. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3633.7s)]
*  Sometimes they cook in joints and sometimes the whole body is doubled up in a sitting position with the knees to the chin put into the oven and served up so as they squat around for their meal. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3635.7s)]
*  Their appetite for human flesh is never satisfied. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3646.7s)]
*  Do you mean to say that you will forbid us the fish of the sea? [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3650.7s)]
*  Why, these are our fish. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3653.7s)]
*  This is how they talk when you speak against cannibalism. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3655.7s)]
*  Very often institutionalized cannibalism contains a strong element of vengeance. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3659.7s)]
*  Killing another human being, especially in societies where incurring a blood feud with his kinsmen was the only means of justice, stays with a person. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3668.7s)]
*  It stays with a person psychologically. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3684.7s)]
*  It stays with a person similar to the way that leaving a lie outstanding stays with you. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3687.7s)]
*  Lying is devastating to the liar because it creates this internal tension that ends up expressing itself in unbidden thoughts and suspicions and fears and dreams. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3693.7s)]
*  Psychologists and self-help authors and religious leaders who were actually doing their jobs figured out a long time ago that the way to discharge that tension and exercise that demon, that demon that parasitically attaches itself to the back of your mind to constantly remind you of your deception, is to just confess it. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3704.7s)]
*  Lying like killing is an act that is fraught with ambivalence. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3722.7s)]
*  Ambivalence is what I'm trying to get at here with the analogy. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3729.7s)]
*  It gets you out of trouble. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3733.7s)]
*  I'm talking about a lie. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3735.7s)]
*  A lie gets you out of trouble or maybe it gets you something that you want in the immediate future. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3736.7s)]
*  But over time, the costs of maintaining your deception become so onerous that people literally lose themselves in drugs and alcohol or break up their families or even kill themselves or other people just to escape the pressure of their lives without having to face the terror of telling the truth. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3741.7s)]
*  You know, there's so much ambivalent energy in there it tears people apart. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3758.7s)]
*  Unless you're a psychopath, the main product of all that ambivalence, forget about the thoughts. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3763.7s)]
*  Those are secondary. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3769.7s)]
*  The feeling that gives rise to the thoughts is this vague, sort of dull but somehow perfectly clear sense that this is not over. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3771.7s)]
*  There's something still outstanding about it. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3783.7s)]
*  There's something still outstanding. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3786.7s)]
*  There's something still out there. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3788.7s)]
*  Killing is like that. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3790.7s)]
*  Now, there's so much ambivalent energy tied up in killing. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3794.7s)]
*  There's, you know, the feeling of joy that comes with having defeated an enemy. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3799.7s)]
*  There's the sublime animal power of having released that primal aggression. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3804.7s)]
*  But then there's the recognition of yourself and the dying eyes of your victim. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3810.7s)]
*  There's the fear of vengeance and there's so much more. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3814.7s)]
*  All these ambivalent energies just pulling a killer in different directions, just threatening to tear him apart. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3817.7s)]
*  Ritual and mythology in part function to structure these opposing feelings in a way that discharges the tension and frees the individual from that ambivalence. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3824.7s)]
*  Psychologist that we mentioned earlier, Eli Sagan, he's got this great little book on the psychogenesis of ritual cannibalism that I've drawn on very heavily for this, by the way. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3836.7s)]
*  He wrote, quote, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3845.7s)]
*  And now he's quoting an anthropological report. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3866.7s)]
*  The killer or captor of the man who was to be eaten would go straight to his own hut and stay there for about a month, living on roast taro and hot coconut milk. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3893.7s)]
*  His wife would continue to share his hut, but must for that period sleep apart from him. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3902.7s)]
*  He remains thus isolated in his hut because he is afraid of the blood of the dead man. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3907.7s)]
*  And it is for this reason that he does not join his fellow warriors in partaking of the flesh. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3913.7s)]
*  For if he were to do this, he believes his belly would become full of blood and he would promptly die, end quote. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3918.7s)]
*  Quick side note, that subquote that Sagan is quoting there, by the way, it's from a book on cannibalism and human sacrifice that I've not been able to get my hands on. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3926.7s)]
*  I always try whenever there's a citation like that, I try to find and read the book in question and usually I am able to do it, but sometimes not. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3938.7s)]
*  And those of you who have donated to this podcast, by the way, you don't have any idea what a huge help it is because that's where it goes. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3946.7s)]
*  It goes to books and papers. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3954.7s)]
*  Anyway, I couldn't find this one, and so I'm not sure which people he's talking about, but the taro and coconut tells us somewhere it's out in the islands. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3957.7s)]
*  End of side note. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3965.7s)]
*  Okay, get my bearings. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3967.7s)]
*  Oh, so in addition to being in personal spiritual danger, a killer or a captor of a cannibal victim was also frequently felt to be a serious danger to the rest of his own community. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3970.7s)]
*  Sagan continues, quote, in Maori. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3984.7s)]
*  So we're talking about New Zealand now. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3987.7s)]
*  In Maori, the war party was met outside the village by the priestesses who danced a wakatama, a dance of derision, and sang a song that asked the warriors whence they had come. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=3989.7s)]
*  They answered that they were followers of two, the war god, and had come from taking vengeance. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4002.7s)]
*  The warriors were not allowed to mingle with the joyful people of the village until they had gone through the rite of wakahoa, making common. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4008.7s)]
*  They proceeded to sit naked on the side of the stream while a naked priest offered to the god Tiki a pebble from the stream, a piece of fern root, and a piece of human flesh. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4016.7s)]
*  The principal priest took portions of the locks of hair from the warriors and offered them to the war god too. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4027.7s)]
*  The high priestess was given the ear of the first man killed to eat. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4034.7s)]
*  It was the only occasion when a woman might partake of human flesh. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4038.7s)]
*  The hearts of the slain were roasted. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4042.7s)]
*  A portion offered to two and the rest eaten by the priests. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4045.7s)]
*  The fighting men started dancing toward the village, bearing fern stalks in their hands to which were tied the hair of their victims. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4049.7s)]
*  The priests shouted spells that finally removed the blood curse and left the warriors hoa, common, free from taboo, and able to enter the ordinary activities of the tribe. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4056.7s)]
*  Sagan is drawing this account from Edward Trigger's book, The Maori Race. It's an old book. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4068.7s)]
*  And it's a really interesting example because, you know, you go back to the beginning of the quote, the Maori villagers are already celebrating the successful taking of revenge by their warriors, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4074.7s)]
*  even as the warriors are being quarantined outside the village and enduring a dance of derision from the priestesses, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4087.7s)]
*  which, you know, that kind of reminds me of an earlier version of waiting for Vietnam soldiers to get home and get off the plane so we can spit at them and call them baby killers or something. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4094.7s)]
*  It's like a seems like there's some kind of an ancient ritual going on there. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4103.7s)]
*  And even as the rest of the village is celebrating their victory, the killers have to go through a series of rituals to cleanse them of a curse. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4107.7s)]
*  And that ritual is very interesting because it carries a double meaning, right? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4115.7s)]
*  Waka hoa, the ritual that allows them to be integrated back into the society, means making common. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4119.7s)]
*  And on the most basic level, you know, it allows them to reenter the common life of their people. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4126.7s)]
*  But it also means to make them common, to bring them back down from the realm of the sacred. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4131.7s)]
*  Many peoples all around the world, certainly the Aztecs, experienced the inexplicable, right, as opening portals to sacred power. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4139.7s)]
*  Death, disease, natural disasters, you know, the generative power of woman, the growth of plants, you know, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4152.7s)]
*  these and other mysteries were always set about with rites and taboos to control the unpredictable power that they that they pointed to from pouring uncontrollably into the world of everyday life. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4161.7s)]
*  Today, we know that war veterans who are unable to properly reacclimate to the mundane world of civilian life can suffer and sometimes even become a danger to themselves and others. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4176.7s)]
*  Well, earlier peoples were not stupid, and they certainly didn't lack observational powers. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4188.7s)]
*  They were limited only by their language and the conceptual framework that they had available to describe what they were seeing. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4193.7s)]
*  And so they understood that men who came back from killing had changed somehow. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4199.7s)]
*  And it was not a simple thing to successfully take those men and and and and re-involve them back into an everyday life [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4204.7s)]
*  that includes, you know, grandmothers and scurrying toddlers running around. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4214.7s)]
*  It's just ambivalence, ambivalence, ambivalence. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4219.7s)]
*  I mean, this is this is the word. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4223.7s)]
*  It's the word to keep in mind at all times when talking about sacrificing cannibalism, ambivalence. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4225.7s)]
*  In fact, if you launch one word in your head to frame this in the next episode, ambivalence is Pee-wee's word of the day. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4232.7s)]
*  The killers are heroes. They are cursed. They're protectors. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4240.7s)]
*  They're dangerous. They're triumphantly joyful. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4244.7s)]
*  They're regretful. The killer himself glories in his victory, and yet he feels this unaccountable stain of corruption on him. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4248.7s)]
*  He's closed his account with the other person, but he might have incurred a terrible blood debt with his relatives. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4256.7s)]
*  And so again, the overwhelming feeling underneath whatever words and explanations we use to mythologize the experience, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4262.7s)]
*  as long as there is unresolved ambivalence, the overwhelming feeling is that this is not over. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4270.7s)]
*  So if it's not over, the question is how to make it over, how to end it. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4278.7s)]
*  And now, you know, with some of these last examples, we've begun to see that structuring these ambivalent feelings relative to one another. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4283.7s)]
*  Disentangling them in a way that allows their energy to be discharged, again, is a primary function of ritual and myth. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4291.7s)]
*  Another way to put it is maybe like this. Animals kill and eat, right? But only humans sacrifice and feast. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4301.7s)]
*  Animals are slaughtered. Only humans can be martyred. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4309.7s)]
*  It sounds strange to say, but there was a time when ritualized human sacrifice and cannibalism were a highly civilized and highly civilizing institutions. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4314.7s)]
*  In fact, I'll claim with confidence that without them, there would have been no path politically, sociologically, psychologically, whatever. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4325.7s)]
*  There would have been no path forward to our modern world. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4335.7s)]
*  Now, I get that I'm going to need to back that up. So next, we're going to go down to the borderlands of Ecuador and Peru around the three rivers, Pistaza Morena and Uponto Santiago. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4338.7s)]
*  We're getting closer to Mexico. Be patient. Getting there. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4348.7s)]
*  And we're talking about the Hibaro natives, the Hibaro that dominated the region. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4352.7s)]
*  They were among the fiercest and most savage tribes in South America at the time of contact. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4358.7s)]
*  And so as you'd expect, they never united beyond just small tribes that maintain themselves in an almost permanent state of total war with one another. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4364.7s)]
*  The education of their young boys focused pretty much exclusively on raising fierce warriors. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4373.7s)]
*  Tribes were often dying out and merging with one another because wars of extermination happened all the time. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4379.7s)]
*  And so going through the literature, I found this old piece about them from 1923 in the Smithsonian Archive called Blood Revenge War and Victory Feasts Among the Hibaro Indians of Eastern Ecuador. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4385.7s)]
*  You got to love the old days when the humanities actually got to the point. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4395.7s)]
*  Here's a quote. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4400.7s)]
*  When we read that, especially the first part is enjoy [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4445.7s)]
*  especially the first part, is they delight in mutilating and destroying their enemy as much as possible. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4470.7s)]
*  You read that, and we're not thinking that these people are somehow too gentle or too civilized for cannibalism, right? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4476.54s)]
*  You read through the rest of that book, and you'll see that the Hibaro could and probably did do pretty much every horrific thing you can think of to their enemies. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4483.179999999999s)]
*  Except, for one thing, they never ate any part of the bodies. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4493.98s)]
*  Why not? [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4500.22s)]
*  You know, if I had read that quote that I just read, and then followed it up by telling you that then after that they finished up by cooking the corpses, it's not like you would have been terribly shocked by that. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4502.22s)]
*  Especially when I tell you how they would speak to their worst enemies. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4512.700000000001s)]
*  Yutahe, they would say. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4517.26s)]
*  Which means, I will eat you. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4519.26s)]
*  And it was the equivalent of saying, eat shit or fuck you in our culture. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4521.26s)]
*  Which is interesting in itself, because... [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4525.26s)]
*  Yeah, okay. I wasn't sure if I was going to talk about this. Let's talk about it for a second. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4529.26s)]
*  It's interesting because it mirrors Freud's theory of psychosexual development. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4533.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4537.26s)]
*  So, human infants, as you may know, are born very early. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4539.26s)]
*  It's one of the things that distinguishes us as a species. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4543.820000000001s)]
*  If alien zoologists were surveying the life on Earth, it's one of the first things that they would notice about the human species. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4547.820000000001s)]
*  Is that we're born very, very early. Too early. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4555.820000000001s)]
*  In fact, speaking about that, I keep going off on tangents, but we'll see how this goes. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4559.820000000001s)]
*  I remember watching this old Disney nature documentary one time. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4565.820000000001s)]
*  Joseph Campbell, I could talk about this. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4569.820000000001s)]
*  It was on this beach, an island somewhere, where giant sea turtles would come every year to lay their eggs. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4572.38s)]
*  Only now it was time for all the eggs to hatch. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4578.38s)]
*  So, the parents are long gone by now, and these turtles, these little baby turtles, start crawling up out of the sand where they've been buried. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4582.38s)]
*  And as soon as they became visible, bam! The birds are swooping down and scooping them up. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4590.38s)]
*  They do these things immediately, just make a beeline for the water, which means going through crashing waves that toss around these little silver dollar-sized turtles all over the place. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4596.9400000000005s)]
*  If they're lucky enough to make it through the birds, past the waves, and into the water, these 10-minute-old creatures have got to start looking for things to eat right away. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4606.9400000000005s)]
*  And if they don't find something soon, and then consistently, they're as good as bird food. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4616.9400000000005s)]
*  And yet, somehow, there are still sea turtles. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4620.9400000000005s)]
*  There are still sea turtles, because they come out of the gate. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4625.5s)]
*  They come out of the egg with most of what it takes to be a sea turtle already pretty much wired up. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4629.5s)]
*  Keep it simple, keep it specific, spit out a lot of them, a few of them will make it through the gauntlet. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4637.5s)]
*  You've got sea turtles, right? Humans are very, very different. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4643.5s)]
*  As our brains got bigger, women's hips had to grow, had to widen to accommodate the birth process with our big-ass heads, with our big-ass brains. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4648.06s)]
*  But eventually, you kind of hit this point of diminishing returns, right? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4657.06s)]
*  Eventually, you get to a point where wider hips are becoming a greater liability than the bigger cranium was worth, I guess. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4662.06s)]
*  And so, we compensated for that by being born very, very, very early, and doing a lot of our development outside of the womb. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4670.620000000001s)]
*  Those little turtles, they pop up out of the egg, crawl up into the sand, and they just make a run for the surf as soon as they're born. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4678.620000000001s)]
*  And when they get into the water, they know exactly what to do. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4686.620000000001s)]
*  But you could, you know, these things are 10 minutes old. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4688.620000000001s)]
*  You leave a two-year-old little human on the beach, and it's just going to wander around like an idiot until it stars. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4690.620000000001s)]
*  I mean, a newborn baby is really just, it's still a fetus in a lot of ways, basically. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4697.18s)]
*  It's not just that we were born and we don't know how to do things yet. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4703.18s)]
*  I mean, our early disabilities, they run way, way deeper than that. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4707.18s)]
*  I mean, think about it. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4711.18s)]
*  Human infants, human infants are little worms for a long time. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4713.18s)]
*  You know, when we're first born, and for some weeks afterward, most of our nervous system isn't even finished being wired up yet. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4717.740000000001s)]
*  You ever watch an infant try to move? [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4725.740000000001s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4727.740000000001s)]
*  You know, just, the infant can suck on a nipple, it can digest whatever it gets out of it, and that is about it. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4729.740000000001s)]
*  That's literally about all it can do. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4735.740000000001s)]
*  The muscles and the nerves of the mouth, throat, and digestive system, those come out pretty much pre-exercise. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4739.740000000001s)]
*  You know, ready-made, but nothing else even really works yet. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4746.3s)]
*  So this is the oral stage of psychosexual development that Freud described. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4750.3s)]
*  And it's kind of a human universal, even if you don't follow his exact theory of the way he handles it. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4756.3s)]
*  This period is a human universal. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4762.3s)]
*  In the beginning, we all experience the world through the mouth. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4764.3s)]
*  That is how it begins. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4770.3s)]
*  Our first knowledge of the world comes through the organ of the mouth, and is understood in the vocabulary of tastes and textures defined by the mouth. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4772.860000000001s)]
*  The mouth is also the medium of our first social interaction. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4782.860000000001s)]
*  This is something that Jordan Peterson has really helped me understand. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4786.860000000001s)]
*  It's obvious when you think about it, but it's just so brilliant to think about how intensely social of a thing that breastfeeding is. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4790.860000000001s)]
*  Infants can struggle, they bite. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4802.860000000001s)]
*  If they're screaming, the mother has to calm them down first. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4806.860000000001s)]
*  All of this has to be non-verbal. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4810.860000000001s)]
*  All communication is non-verbal, and at first it's non-visual. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4812.860000000001s)]
*  You can't even look the thing in the eye or anything like that. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4816.860000000001s)]
*  It's purely through touch and maybe a little bit of sound to kind of coo at it and set the mood, but that's it. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4820.860000000001s)]
*  That's all you have to manage this insanely complicated and primal interaction. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4825.42s)]
*  It's one of those mysteries that as a man I can only look at from the outside and marvel at, but I definitely don't have access to it, but it fascinates me. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4833.42s)]
*  The mouth is also the first medium through which we have our first experiences of repression and frustration. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4841.42s)]
*  When a mother has to teach her baby in their secret little language not to do certain things. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4849.42s)]
*  It's the first time that the mother has to control its behavior. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4853.9800000000005s)]
*  It's also our first experience of alienation comes through the mouth in the sense that the first time that we ever open our mouths to cry out so that the world can come and fill it up to satisfy our hunger, and that doesn't happen right away. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4857.9800000000005s)]
*  There's a delay between our demand and its fulfillment that that delay sort of sets us down the path of realizing that hey, that age of warm unified amniotic bliss is over. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4869.9800000000005s)]
*  This is very complicated stuff that we all have to go through. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4882.54s)]
*  And so babies begin to grow, begin to ambulate, move around, and parents find themselves repeating one phrase more than anything else. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4888.54s)]
*  Don't put that in your mouth. Get that out of your mouth, right? [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4896.54s)]
*  Because kids at this age are putting everything in their mouth because it's still the primary means by which they experience and interact with the world. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4900.54s)]
*  And why wouldn't it be? You're born that way. It's the first thing that you have. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4909.1s)]
*  It's your whole world in a way at the very beginning. It's your whole world in a way. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4913.1s)]
*  It's your portal out into the rest of the world. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4919.1s)]
*  And you start to grow and your body starts to fill out and everything else starts to work. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4923.1s)]
*  And now you've got to start to learn to use the rest of your body and everything to experience the world. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4929.1s)]
*  And that's a process. It's a process that we all have to mature into, right? [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4935.660000000001s)]
*  And as you can imagine, these things tend to go in order for a reason. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4939.660000000001s)]
*  There's a reason that it's very important to get kids past this stage pretty quickly where they're just putting everything in their mouth. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4943.660000000001s)]
*  You want to get finished with that before you start toilet training, right? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4951.660000000001s)]
*  Occasionally parents are toilet training their kids and after they've had a little bit of practice, maybe you'll leave them in the bathroom to kind of try it themselves. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4955.660000000001s)]
*  A lot of parents have this experience at some point where they walk in and find the kid, [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4964.22s)]
*  their little trainee making art on the walls with their waste products. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4968.22s)]
*  But that's better than walking in and finding out that the kid is still caught up in the oral stage. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4972.22s)]
*  You don't want to walk in and find that. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4977.22s)]
*  And so it's very important. I mean, this sounds kind of silly or primitive or something. It's very important stuff. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4980.22s)]
*  So when talking about this stuff, the thing to know and to keep in mind is that anything humans are forced to repress [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4987.780000000001s)]
*  tends to become a matter of intense fascination for us. It's just how we're built. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=4998.780000000001s)]
*  We first experience the world through the mouth. And so the first attempts to civilize us and structure our behavior [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5005.780000000001s)]
*  concerns what we do and do not do with our mouth. Right at the beginning, not to bite the nipple. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5013.34s)]
*  That's the first thing. But then it's don't put things in your mouth and so on and so forth. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5018.34s)]
*  The next stage of trying to civilize a little potential barbarian involves potty training him. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5022.34s)]
*  And in this stage, intense attention is typically paid by the parents to controlling where and when and how the child does it [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5029.34s)]
*  and what they do with the waste products afterwards. It's very important to most parents, at least it should be. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5039.900000000001s)]
*  People get stuck sometimes in one or another of these stages of development due to trauma or some other set of causes sometimes [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5046.900000000001s)]
*  and it will mangle their personality. I mean, into adulthood. Absolutely mangle your personality. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5053.900000000001s)]
*  After the oral and anal stages of psychosexual development, there's some other stuff in there. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5060.900000000001s)]
*  There's two other stages that we're not going to worry about right now. And finally, the genital stage. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5067.46s)]
*  And this is the period where you're walking through Target and you've got to keep telling your little boy to take his hands out of his pants all the time. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5070.46s)]
*  Parents have to go through this stuff all the time. Wait, you mean that was just me? Never mind. Anyway. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5079.46s)]
*  The goal of each of these stages is to come out of them having been properly socialized in the use of your mouth, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5085.46s)]
*  in the elimination of your waste and in the management of your sex organs. That's the goal. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5094.02s)]
*  Properly socialized in those incredibly important functions. Not only biological, but social functions. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5097.02s)]
*  And again, it sounds so incredibly primitive, but this is the foundation of all human social life. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5106.02s)]
*  Although I do want to be clear that I'm drawing out and simplifying aspects of this that I think are relevant to our topic. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5112.02s)]
*  It's obviously much more complicated. So depending on a child's natural tendency to be agreeable or rebellious, among other factors, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5119.580000000001s)]
*  it can be a real struggle to move the kid through these stages successfully on schedule. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5128.580000000001s)]
*  It can be. I mean, it's a big deal and it's not easy. And a lot of it has to do with the child's natural inclination. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5135.580000000001s)]
*  So not keeping up is it is it is an absolutely cataclysmic failure of socialization. It destroys lives. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5142.14s)]
*  OK, if you're still soiling your pants regularly or even occasionally in third grade, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5152.14s)]
*  this is very likely to set off a cascade of effects on that child's developing personality. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5159.14s)]
*  They're going to lead him far away from the general run of social life to which he's supposed to be adapting. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5165.14s)]
*  Parents try to socialize and prepare their children, but other children eventually take over the undone portions of that work. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5170.700000000001s)]
*  And kids are not gentle about it. Kids are brutal. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5177.700000000001s)]
*  You know, if you've got to soil your pants as a third grader, it's much better to do it on the way to school in front of your mother [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5181.700000000001s)]
*  than it is to do it in the middle of class in front of your peers. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5188.700000000001s)]
*  And if a kid continues to struggle with that, then suddenly school and all social situations with other children, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5192.26s)]
*  all of this becomes charged with pressure. Other children might start to seem very threatening. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5201.26s)]
*  Before you know it, you got a kid who avoids interacting with other kids, who never develops adequate social skills, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5208.26s)]
*  who perceives other people as sources of potential danger and so feels perpetually alienated because he was never firmly plunked into a social context [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5214.820000000001s)]
*  in a way that really let him become comfortable in the world and with himself. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5223.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is what happens. This is serious stuff. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5228.820000000001s)]
*  So the pressure to successfully traverse these stages, to be able to master impulse through the executive discipline of the mind, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5232.38s)]
*  the pressure is so tremendous, just incredible pressure for a small child, whose very existence, certainly the affection of his parents to them, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5243.38s)]
*  seems to the child to hang on whether or not he can master these things and become an acceptable social being for his age. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5254.9400000000005s)]
*  It's no wonder that many kids retreat from it and end up on a psychiatrist's couch at 40 years old crying about how they can't stop watching internet porn. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5261.9400000000005s)]
*  Because that's the thing, right? Becoming moves in one direction. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5272.9400000000005s)]
*  If you aren't able to move through these stages on time, nobody is waiting for you. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5278.5s)]
*  Nobody is waiting for you. Your peers are moving on and they will judge you harshly for being delayed in your progress. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5283.5s)]
*  Your body keeps growing, which obviously alters your relationship to the world and starts introducing entirely new biological imperatives, sex and so forth. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5290.5s)]
*  You keep learning new words and new skills. You start to look like and behave in many ways like an adult. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5299.5s)]
*  Whatever your human mind is doing, your animal body just stays the course. That thing is on tracks. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5307.06s)]
*  Your biology doesn't just hit the pause button until you figure out how to stop pissing your pants or putting everything in your mouth. It just doesn't work like that. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5315.06s)]
*  We give babies pacifiers sometimes to sort of help bridge the gap when we take away their primary oral reference, the mother's breast. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5324.06s)]
*  Sometimes small children, not just babies, but small children still require a helping hand. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5333.620000000001s)]
*  Maybe for a while we allow them to do something like suck their thumb. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5339.620000000001s)]
*  But what we need is some sign that you're making progress. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5344.620000000001s)]
*  If you're three years old and still putting everything in your mouth, that's a problem. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5348.620000000001s)]
*  But we'll let you suck on your thumb as a substitute, at least for a while. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5352.620000000001s)]
*  Time waits for no man. As three turns into four and four turns into five, the child keeps growing and their social roles begin to change and become more complicated. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5357.18s)]
*  As this happens, the society applies more and more pressure to send the signal that it's time to grow up. It's time to move on from the oral fixation. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5371.18s)]
*  Now, you know, I mean, it's just amazing to me sometimes that anybody grows up and isn't completely insane. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5378.740000000001s)]
*  But this process isn't helped by the fact that most parents are completely clueless about any of this, except on a very dull sort of basic level. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5386.740000000001s)]
*  I think in a lot of ways culture destroys the natural wisdom of parents in a lot of ways. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5395.740000000001s)]
*  Many, you know, many exasperated parents who don't know what else to do just end up using threats or physical punishment to force the child to repress these impulses of a given stage. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5402.3s)]
*  Because, I mean, we're talking about small children, so we don't like hearing words like threat or physical punishment in the same sentence with them. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5411.3s)]
*  But on the other hand, you have to understand what a parent is facing. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5418.3s)]
*  A parent knows full well what happens to children in public schools who still suck their thumbs or piss their pants or get caught fondling themselves in class. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5421.860000000001s)]
*  It destroys lives. It causes suicides. It creates adults who are never able to properly relate to their social world. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5432.860000000001s)]
*  And so you see this possibility for your child as a parent, and you don't know what to do, and nobody you know knows what to do. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5440.42s)]
*  And anything you have to do to force the child to stop that behavior seems better than allowing it to continue, right? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5447.42s)]
*  I mean, sometimes you'll hear about parents with children who won't stop sucking their thumbs, who put hot sauce on the thumb or something to, you know, condition the child like Pavlov's dog. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5454.42s)]
*  And that's barbaric. But it's not something that's ever been done. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5463.42s)]
*  And that's barbaric. But, you know, it's barbaric from one standpoint. But most parents, they don't have the resources or the knowledge to deal with this kind of thing much better than the children do. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5468.9800000000005s)]
*  And this is... Sometimes I think that the reason a lot of us don't remember our early childhood is not because we don't actually remember it, or just because it was so goddamn stressful that we don't want to remember it. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5482.9800000000005s)]
*  And so this is stress that a child does not need, and certainly does not have the emotional resources or maturity to deal with, but they have no choice but to deal with it. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5492.54s)]
*  And so, forced into this situation by the collision of their biology with a complicated social world, the child faces the choice of either finding socially acceptable substitutes wherever it can. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5505.54s)]
*  Freud, for example, thought that overeating and smoking and constant gum chewing were examples of adults who still had too much energy tied up in the oral stage, for example. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5517.1s)]
*  I have some problems with that part of it, but anyway. Or, if you can't identify and employ substitute satisfactions, you just have to repress whatever's left over. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5529.1s)]
*  Just repress it, just push it down, just get it out of here. But that, again, does not come without a cost, and it's a significant one. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5539.660000000001s)]
*  Not least because, as we mentioned, whatever we repress becomes a center of fascination, right? As our psyche sort of seeks ways to work it out and give expression to it. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5548.660000000001s)]
*  Now, aggression is often thought, kind of come in full circle now, aggression is often thought by many people to only be a secondary emotional response to frustration or fear, experiences like that. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5559.22s)]
*  And there's a case to be made for that perspective, but I don't think that way. I think we come out of the womb built for war. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5575.22s)]
*  Like, Wichita Lepochtli, the Aztec god of war who was born fully armed in a raid for battle. I think that's human beings. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5582.780000000001s)]
*  You might have heard before that babies seem to have some natural sense of what to do when they're dropped in water, right? They know to close their eyes and hold their breath, for example. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5590.780000000001s)]
*  They also sort of move their arms and legs in a manner that looks like it's trying to stay afloat, but apparently that's not what that is. That's what I've heard. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5601.780000000001s)]
*  So the whole thing doesn't work very well, obviously, and they don't last very long. So don't go run an experiment with your baby in the ocean and tell the cops that Martyr Maid said it was cool. It's not cool. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5609.34s)]
*  But the point is that the reflex exists and it seems to emerge very early. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5619.34s)]
*  So similarly, if an insect or a spider crawls across an infant's face, the infant often seems to know to attack it, which at first just means to bite it if it can. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5623.900000000001s)]
*  And we might think, well, infants will bite anything, so who knows what they're doing, and fine. But nursing mothers often find out that their babies will refuse the breast when they're not hungry by biting the nipple. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5635.900000000001s)]
*  And some really strong-willed, precocious little bastards will actually let the mother know when they're ready to be weaned altogether, because they'll just start biting the breast all the time and refusing to take it. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5649.46s)]
*  And I mention this to emphasize that aggression, like all of a child's libidinal energies, follows the path of psychosexual development that we were just talking about, collecting around and seeking satisfaction through whatever the dying child is. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5663.46s)]
*  And that's what the dominant stage is at the time. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5679.46s)]
*  And that means that the first experiences and expressions of aggression in all human beings is oral aggression, aggression with the mouth. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5683.46s)]
*  People who engage in cannibalism are engaging in oral aggression. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5694.46s)]
*  Societies that do it are institutionalizing oral aggression. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5699.46s)]
*  Ritualization is the first step toward achieving control over any given behavior, and the rituals of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, for example, are all about establishing control. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5704.02s)]
*  The Austronesian societies that I mentioned earlier, the island societies, they all grew up out of an identical cultural base, but they can be ranked by their level of relative social complexity and political development, we mentioned earlier. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5718.02s)]
*  Among the peoples that practice or refer to ritual cannibalism, the rule is that the more primitive societies eat with minimal hesitation and less ritual preparation. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5732.580000000001s)]
*  And as you move up the ladder of development and complexity, you start to see societies that engage in very limited and specific forms of cannibalism. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5748.580000000001s)]
*  For example, eating only certain ritually significant parts or restricting the practice to a special cannibal society, and the rest of the society just vicariously shares in the experience. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5756.14s)]
*  When those head-hunting Hibara warriors shout, I will eat you! at their enemies, but don't eat them, but only take their heads as trophies, we're observing a substitute practice, serving as a bridge, just like the thumb sucking, or the pacifier, for a society that's moving beyond the oral stage as its primary mode of experiencing and enacting aggression. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5769.700000000001s)]
*  There are a few tribes that practice both head-hunting and cannibalism, but they are the exception. The overwhelming majority practice one or the other, and the ones that do both, they very clearly link them together. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5794.26s)]
*  Sagan informs us, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5806.820000000001s)]
*  If we think about the occasions for head-hunting, they appear to be identical to those for cannibalism, war, revenge, sadism, and proof of masculinity. The ritual of taboo and ceremony that surrounds head-hunting activity is almost indistinguishable from that which is intimately associated with cannibalism. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5809.38s)]
*  Just below the surface of the phenomenon, you get down beneath the disguise, and the cannibal and the head-hunter seem to be doing something like the same thing. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5829.9400000000005s)]
*  Quoting again from the earlier source about the Hibaro, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5843.94s)]
*  In such a case, there cannot be a victory feast. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5874.5s)]
*  In most primitive societies, male social status is determined by your ability to bring back food and share it with one's allies and family members, and by your ability as a warrior. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5880.5s)]
*  In head-hunting societies, head trophies take over that role and sort of combine them in a way. They fulfill that very fundamental social function. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5893.06s)]
*  Sagan also writes, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5905.06s)]
*  Real quick, another sidebar here. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5923.06s)]
*  Just on behalf of all men, here's a public service announcement to all of the women out there who are like, oh my god, why are men not getting married? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5925.620000000001s)]
*  I don't know, ladies. Maybe because for a huge chunk of our history, none of you would marry any of us until we brought back a head-hunting trophy. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5936.18s)]
*  Things have changed pretty quickly in the world. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5946.740000000001s)]
*  To it, lady ladies, am I correct? [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5968.26s)]
*  You talked about wars, and the cantim Agrif produit, dum? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5970.26s)]
*  get our bearings. For most of our history, you've had us running around cutting off heads and eating human flesh. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5974.26s)]
*  Okay. Give us a little bit of time. We'll come around, but give us a break. Anyway. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5979.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I think I mentioned this in societies where we do find both head hunting and cannibalism. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5987.3s)]
*  You can almost see the baton being passed from one to the other, from cannibalism to head hunting, that head hunting is taking over for cannibalism. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=5993.3s)]
*  C.K. Meek, in one of the volumes of his Tribal Studies of Northern Nigeria, he kind of writes about this quote. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6002.820000000001s)]
*  The slayer rode around on his horse, brandishing a knife in his right hand. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6010.5s)]
*  One of the first duties of the head getter on reaching home was to go to the house of the priest who had charge of the head hunting rites and receive a further dose of protective medicine consisting of two mouthfuls of palm and mahogany oil and a small piece of the flesh from the victim's skull. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6015.38s)]
*  This rite of eating a small piece of flesh of the skull is of particular interest, I'm sorry, of peculiar interest in proving one purpose, at least, of cannibalism had the religious object of destroying the dead enemy's soul. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6030.82s)]
*  In a similar vein, Sagan reports, quote, Among the Cogaro, the protective medicine included a few drops of blood from the captured head. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6045.219999999999s)]
*  The warrior spent the night in the priest's house covered with a cloth and fumigated by the smoke of branches of certain trees. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6053.860000000001s)]
*  This whole process was engaged in to ensure that the ghost of the slain victim would not pursue the head taker, end quote. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6060.740000000001s)]
*  In several cases, Sagan writes, The priest ate part of the flesh to protect the head getter, but the head getter himself did not. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6067.700000000001s)]
*  This flesh eating was part of the ritual that protected the slayer. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6075.780000000001s)]
*  The chauai brought all captured heads to the chief priest. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6079.86s)]
*  The heads were boiled, the priest ate a piece of the flesh, and the skulls were then deposited in the sacred hut. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6083.78s)]
*  The head getter was anointed with a filthy smelling mixture that included the intestines of a porcupine, and he remained hidden during these purification rites. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6090.179999999999s)]
*  Afterward, he rejoined the tribe, was treated as a hero, and drank beer with the elders. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6098.66s)]
*  In the education of the young, a small amount of cannibalism might be permitted by tribes who engaged in no other forms of eating human flesh. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6103.94s)]
*  A father who has been on a successful head hunt and returned with a coveted trophy should he have a son of five or six years, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6112.9s)]
*  will take a small portion of the flesh from the head, about the size of a pea, and a drop of blood, mix these with a little sago, yam, or taro, or some other vegetable, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6120.82s)]
*  make it into a kind of pill, and give it to the young child. This is said to make the boy, Serao and Nito, fierce forever." [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6130.099999999999s)]
*  So it seems pretty clear to me, because there's a lot of other examples like this. I obviously don't want to linger on it too long, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6141.86s)]
*  but there's so many examples that make it very clear to me that head hunting, which is such a [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6150.259999999999s)]
*  such a strange practice to just invent ex nihilo, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6155.379999999999s)]
*  especially since it's one that we find all throughout the Austronesian islands, Africa, and the Americas at the time of contact, [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6159.3s)]
*  probably around the world if we go back far enough, I think. It's pretty clear to me that head hunting is a transition form [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6166.74s)]
*  used by people who are leaving behind the oral stage as the primary locus of aggressive motivation. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6172.5s)]
*  And as Raphael Carston, who's our source for the Hibaro Indian Head Hunters, informs us, head hunting, just like cannibalism, [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6179.22s)]
*  is always a profoundly religious act, just as [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6187.06s)]
*  the transition from cannibalism to head hunting is always a religious process. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6191.3s)]
*  Writing about how the Hibaro believed the spirits of their dead enemies, whose heads they had claimed, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6198.74s)]
*  would be compelled to serve their killers as advisors or slaves, and that they would work with loyalty to facilitate the success of their murderer, [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6204.9s)]
*  Carston wrote, [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6214.02s)]
*  Now according to the idea of the Hibaro, it is precisely the tzantza, that is the preserved head, [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6216.66s)]
*  which will cause the domestic animals and fields to grow and develop not only in the normal way, but with an extraordinary force. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6222.9s)]
*  The Hibaro did not find anything contradictory in the thought that the spirit of the slain enemy on the one hand [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6230.02s)]
*  entertains feelings of hatred and revenge against his slayer and always looks for an opportunity to harm him, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6235.54s)]
*  and on the other hand, at the same time as it were, plays a role as his friend and advisor. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6241.22s)]
*  The latter, it must be understood, he has become [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6246.98s)]
*  under the influence of the magical conjuration through the ceremonies performed at the feast [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6250.66s)]
*  Sua Martiniu. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6256.02s)]
*  The tzantza of the Hibaro Indians, thus, is not a trophy in the common sense of the word, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6258.74s)]
*  not exclusively a mark of distinction or a visible proof that an enemy has been killed. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6264.58s)]
*  The Hibaro warrior not only tries to take the life of his enemy, but above everything wants to secure control of his soul. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6270.1s)]
*  The so-called Aynsupani is not merely a victory feast in the sense familiar to us, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6277.78s)]
*  but at the same time, and first of all, a kind of mystery feast, when we are able to penetrate into its real meaning, [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6283.62s)]
*  throws, which, when we are able to penetrate into its real meaning, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6290.9800000000005s)]
*  throws an interesting light not only upon the social life of these Indians in general, [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6294.82s)]
*  and the ideas they connect with their wars, but also upon their, in some respect, rather far-reaching religious views. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6299.38s)]
*  The rule is, however, among the Hibaro that a warrior who has captured a head should celebrate a feast. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6306.58s)]
*  The head feast for the Hibaro opens the road to honor and fame, to material wealth, to new victories over enemies in a long life. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6312.82s)]
*  It is the great mystery feast of the Hibaro Indians, as will presently be seen. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6321.06s)]
*  It, in part, has a purely religious significance, and as much as the Hibaro, through the ceremonies thereby performed, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6325.54s)]
*  believes he acquires the same benefits as most other savage peoples do, try to acquire by cult actions of a different kind." [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6332.02s)]
*  Some tribes believe that their crops simply won't grow without the aid of taken heads. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6342.26s)]
*  Many times, their head-hunting expeditions are timed to coincide with planting or reaping. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6348.42s)]
*  There's the example of the Bantok people of the Philippines who believe that every farm requires a new head for every planting season. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6355.7s)]
*  This is around the world we find this kind of thing. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6362.5s)]
*  And what's very interesting about it is that the the benefits that are supposed to accrue [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6366.18s)]
*  from the taking of a head are pretty much down the line exactly the same as the benefits that cannibals expect to to accrue from their activities. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6371.3s)]
*  Now, [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6381.54s)]
*  to come back to Freud and Freudian terms, this process that we're talking about here, [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6383.3s)]
*  this transition from cannibalism to head-hunting, this process of [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6388.34s)]
*  employing a substitute to satisfy a more basic desire is called sublimation, and we all do it. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6391.84s)]
*  Zombies are completely unsublimated human beings. They're human beings without symbolic consciousness, and when you strip that away, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6398.74s)]
*  all that's left is their appetite. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6405.7s)]
*  Head-hunting is, to us, it's unimaginably barbaric, right? But somehow, even to us, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6408.66s)]
*  it's somehow less barbaric than ritual cannibalism. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6414.74s)]
*  And ritual cannibalism is somehow less barbaric than just [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6418.98s)]
*  chaotically attacking and tearing apart an enemy and eating his flesh without any rules or restrictions at all like a zombie would do. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6422.98s)]
*  Sublimation is a term that I think Freud borrowed from chemistry. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6430.74s)]
*  It refers in chemistry to the process by which matter passes from solid to gas [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6435.7s)]
*  without passing through the intervening liquid phase, and it's a brilliant reappropriation of that term. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6440.82s)]
*  He uses it to refer to the process by which [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6447.299999999999s)]
*  a person satisfies an instinctual drive [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6451.0599999999995s)]
*  through symbolic means. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6454.58s)]
*  Okay? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6457.379999999999s)]
*  He uses it to refer to the process by which a person can satisfy [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6458.419999999999s)]
*  an instinctual drive through symbolic means. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6462.82s)]
*  A tribe that collects and preserves heads for the same purposes previously [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6467.38s)]
*  satisfied by devouring the flesh of their enemies has sublimated the oral aggressive drive through a symbolic substitute. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6473.04s)]
*  A person who can extend his instinctual loyalty and desire to protect his biological kin, [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6481.38s)]
*  who can extend that feeling to [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6488.82s)]
*  fans of the same sports team or to patriots of the same nation, is engaging his capacity for sublimation. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6491.38s)]
*  He's etherealizing a natural impulse, directing its energy toward a symbolic object, if that makes sense. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6500.5s)]
*  Sublimation always refers to a vertical substitution. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6511.28s)]
*  Okay? It's not talking about the replacement of a sacrificial goat with a sacrificial sheep. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6515.38s)]
*  That's no more [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6520.5s)]
*  psychologically significant than someone with an oral fixation switching from sucking on a pencil to sucking on a pen. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6522.179999999999s)]
*  Sublimation is taking place when we see the replacement of raw cannibalism for [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6529.12s)]
*  ritual cannibalism of ritually sacrificed victims, or [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6534.339999999999s)]
*  replacing that with human sacrifice with only symbolic cannibalism, like when people [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6538.82s)]
*  make a sacrifice and then offer the human flesh to their gods as food, right? [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6544.66s)]
*  Or from there to the sacrifice of animals, [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6550.099999999999s)]
*  just like in the Bible when God stopped Abraham from sacrificing his son Isaac and gave him a ram to sacrifice instead. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6554.099999999999s)]
*  And then replacing that maybe with just, you know, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6561.78s)]
*  effigies made out of dough and the shape of the animals as they did in ancient Greece, and as you'll even still today [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6565.2s)]
*  see in many Anglican churches to commemorate Saint George's slaying of the dragon. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6572.099999999999s)]
*  A society [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6576.1s)]
*  that can satisfy its oral aggressive drive by eating a loaf of bread in the shape of a dragon on Saint George's day, [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6578.1s)]
*  that is a different kind of society than one that has to still satisfy it by eating the liver of its enemies. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6584.660000000001s)]
*  Okay, this is a process, and the question at every level, [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6592.42s)]
*  from the individual to the broader social context, is whether the mind can devise and the individual and the society can [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6596.900000000001s)]
*  tolerate the replacement of a more direct, [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6604.1s)]
*  literal expression of an act with a symbolic, etherealized version. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6608.18s)]
*  It's through the long and painful history of this process that [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6615.620000000001s)]
*  human beings who once sacrificed and cannibalized other people were able to leave that behind by sacrificing [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6619.780000000001s)]
*  and pretending to consume the body and blood of Jesus Christ every Sunday in the Christian Mass. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6627.14s)]
*  One of the most useful examples, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6632.26s)]
*  and extensive examples that we have of this process comes from the Kwaki'udl tribes of [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6635.3s)]
*  the bountiful northwestern United States and Canada. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6641.3s)]
*  When the Kwaki'udl were discovered by Europeans, [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6646.42s)]
*  excuse me, I've been talking too long, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6650.58s)]
*  when the Europeans discovered the Kwaki'udl, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6653.7s)]
*  the Kwaki'udl had already developed a form of ritual cannibalism that was restricted to a special society of [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6655.7s)]
*  almost pseudo-holy men called Hamatsa. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6662.0199999999995s)]
*  The whole Kwaki'udl society, all their tribes were divided up into these [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6666.26s)]
*  special societies like this, and they all had a special role in the ceremonial calendar. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6671.54s)]
*  In the cannibal society, the Hamatsa were among the most prestigious tribes in the world. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6675.78s)]
*  They all had a special role in the ceremonial calendar. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6679.94s)]
*  In the cannibal society, the Hamatsa were among the most prestigious of all the societies. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6682.82s)]
*  The Hamatsa would go out of their way to sort of [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6689.219999999999s)]
*  put on a performance of being overcome with a ravenous desire for human flesh when the time of their festivals in the winter came. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6693.139999999999s)]
*  Or it might not have been a performance. I don't know. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6701.62s)]
*  It's hard to say with things like this. It might have been an identity that they took on and that once they took it on shaped that person [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6703.62s)]
*  in a profound way once they were inducted into the cannibal society. Who knows? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6710.0199999999995s)]
*  But anyway, a candidate for the cannibal society would be kept apart from everyone else for a period of months. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6715.94s)]
*  And then at the appropriate time, he would start to poke around at the outskirts of his village, whistling and shouting, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6722.339999999999s)]
*  Hap, hap, hap! [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6728.66s)]
*  Eating, eating, eating. That's what hap means. Eating, eating, eating. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6730.58s)]
*  And when the villagers would hear this, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6735.54s)]
*  a certain designated female relative would come out to get him [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6738.34s)]
*  and bring him into the village for something to eat. And once he was in there, [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6742.26s)]
*  the cannibal would just rush around, whooping and shouting and screaming like a wild animal, biting pieces of flesh out of the arms and [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6746.18s)]
*  chests of the villagers. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6752.98s)]
*  Members of the tribe who had died during his months-long separation, [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6756.26s)]
*  they tried to preserve the corpses and they would use those to provide him with food. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6759.78s)]
*  And he could also just have slaves slaughtered on demand whenever he was hungry. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6763.62s)]
*  So a great deal of deference was given to this chaotic creature, right? The anthropologist Franz Boas reported [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6767.54s)]
*  of one such instance. He said, quote, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6774.34s)]
*  A female slave was asked to dance for the hamatsa. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6776.82s)]
*  Before she began dancing, she said, do not get hungry, do not eat me. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6780.26s)]
*  She had hardly said so when her master, who was standing behind her, split her skull with an axe. She was eaten by the hamatsa. End quote. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6784.82s)]
*  Now what's interesting about [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6793.3s)]
*  this particular form, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6795.06s)]
*  that is, [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6797.62s)]
*  of taking [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6798.74s)]
*  the activity of cannibalism and sort of splitting it off to one special designated group, is how the rest of the tribe related to the cannibals. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6801.7s)]
*  You would think that they would hate these people. You would think that they would despise this bunch of [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6810.82s)]
*  nut jobs running around taking bites out of random people, but it was not that simple. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6815.22s)]
*  For one thing, [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6820.42s)]
*  they found a way for just about everybody in the society to participate in the cannibal rite one way or another, either in the killing, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6822.34s)]
*  the preparation of the body, [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6829.7s)]
*  in the ceremony of the meal itself, something. Everybody had a role. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6832.58s)]
*  Members of the bear dancer society, for example, after other people had cut up the body of a slave to be eaten, [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6837.14s)]
*  they would have the privilege of picking up the flesh [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6843.3s)]
*  with their bare hands and bringing it to the hamatsa, and as they would hand it to them to be eaten, they would growl like hungry bears. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6846.179999999999s)]
*  Another society, [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6854.34s)]
*  within the Kwaki'udl tribes, had the job of keeping the cannibal calm and relaxed and soothed, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6856.5s)]
*  and then another society had the task of taunting him with with food and riling him up and making him as crazy as possible. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6862.259999999999s)]
*  The hamatsa was [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6870.42s)]
*  supposed to be driven into a frenzy by certain words like ghost, [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6871.86s)]
*  skulls, and the word for decapitated heads would drive him crazy, and so [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6876.66s)]
*  the people would deliberately use these words in his presence, or they would sing them in songs to drive the cannibal crazy, [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6881.54s)]
*  and if they were successful in drawing out the beast, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6887.219999999999s)]
*  people would run for the exits if they were inside, and whoever got out there [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6890.259999999999s)]
*  and was able to would try to shut and hold the doors closed [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6893.94s)]
*  so that whoever was trapped inside would have bites taken out of them by this frenzied cannibal. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6897.0599999999995s)]
*  It's very complicated. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6903.54s)]
*  For all the chaos that the existence [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6906.34s)]
*  of these people seems to have brought into the social life of the Kwaki'udl, these were highly revered and honored members of their societies. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6910.0199999999995s)]
*  So, [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6918.9s)]
*  the obvious question, [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6920.099999999999s)]
*  if cannibalism is so respectable, [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6922.42s)]
*  why doesn't everybody do it? It's meat, and so if there's nothing wrong with it, why would any of them give it up? [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6925.54s)]
*  And the answer, again, is that it's a sacred act. It's a religious act. It's not just a mere mundane munching of calories. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6932.9s)]
*  There's something similar at play here, too, to what happened with the Maori warriors earlier, who, [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6942.0199999999995s)]
*  you know, they had returned from taking revenge as both honored guests and as [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6947.54s)]
*  people who were dangerously charged with sacred power, something very similar. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6951.54s)]
*  After they have bitten people, and particularly after they have devoured slaves and corpses, [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6956.34s)]
*  the cannibals have to observe many stringent rules before they are allowed to mix freely with other people. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6961.46s)]
*  As soon as they have eaten a corpse, they swallow great quantities of salt water to make them vomit. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6968.18s)]
*  The bones of the body, which they have devoured, are preserved for four months. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6973.38s)]
*  The cannibals may not go out of the house by the ordinary door, but must always use the secret door in the rear of the house. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6978.1s)]
*  When they go back to the house, they must raise their feet four times before they enter it. With the fourth step, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6984.9800000000005s)]
*  they actually pass the door and go in right foot first. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6990.18s)]
*  In the doorway, they turn four times and walk slowly into the house. They are not allowed to look back. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=6994.18s)]
*  Further, for four months after eating human flesh, the cannibal uses a spoon, dish, and kettle of his own, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7000.66s)]
*  which are afterwards thrown away. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7006.66s)]
*  Before taking water out of a bucket or brook, he must dip his cup thrice into the water, and he may not take more than [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7009.06s)]
*  four mouthfuls at a time. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7015.46s)]
*  He must carry the wing bone of an eagle and drink through it, as his lips may not touch the brim of his cup. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7017.54s)]
*  For 16 days, after partaking of human flesh, he may not eat any warm food, and for four months [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7023.86s)]
*  he is not allowed to blow on hot food in order to cool it. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7030.18s)]
*  For a whole year, he must not touch his wife, nor gamble, nor work. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7033.0599999999995s)]
*  When the dancing season is over, he feigns to have forgotten the ordinary ways of men, and has to learn everything anew. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7037.62s)]
*  He acts as though he were hungry all the time. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7044.82s)]
*  End quote. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7048.66s)]
*  And so now, [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7049.94s)]
*  I think we start to see what seems to be happening. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7052.42s)]
*  The entire society participates in Hamatsa cannibalism vicariously by being [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7056.42s)]
*  somehow enlisted in one or another part of the ritual, [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7061.22s)]
*  allowing them to partially experience the act without taking onto themselves the dangerous taboo involved. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7064.42s)]
*  The Hamatsa [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7071.38s)]
*  is revered as the one who takes the sins of the community upon himself, and then endures the period of penance required to purge it. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7073.14s)]
*  And I want to be very clear. Sin and penance and [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7081.22s)]
*  very very imprecise words here. These people would not have recognized [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7084.820000000001s)]
*  the Christian concepts that we would mean by those terms. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7088.42s)]
*  But I'm using them because I don't have a better one. There's unquestionably some kind of a similar dynamic at play, I think. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7090.42s)]
*  You know, we the people no longer wish to take on the negative effects of engaging in cannibalism, yet we're not ready to give it up. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7098.42s)]
*  You people will do it for us, and we will experience it through you, [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7106.34s)]
*  and we will serve and revere you as you recover. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7110.900000000001s)]
*  The Quokkutl, they provide some of the best illustrations of this process of sublimation and action because [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7113.38s)]
*  a lot of it took place before our eyes. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7120.1s)]
*  Like parents placing sanctions on their children, European settlers came in and saw what was going on and [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7122.5s)]
*  forced the Quokkutl against their will to give up many of these more barbaric [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7128.900000000001s)]
*  practices. You know, we see the process of substitution take place in real time, and we even see that the Quokkutl themselves were perfectly aware of what they were doing. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7133.26s)]
*  You know, when the Europeans arrived, Quokkutl tribes were aggressive and warlike, and [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7141.26s)]
*  they engaged not only in limiting the use of weapons, but they engaged in [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7147.18s)]
*  using the weapons of war against the Quokkutl. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7151.1s)]
*  And so, you know, we see that the Quokkutl tribes were very aggressive and [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7153.1s)]
*  warlike, and they engaged not only in limited cannibalism, but also in head hunting, [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7157.5s)]
*  incessant warfare, and [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7166.14s)]
*  vendettas. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7168.3s)]
*  They're famous for a form of symbolic combat called the potlatch, where two [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7169.9s)]
*  combatants, two rivals, would compete for status by seeing who was willing and able [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7176.3s)]
*  to waste or destroy the most of his own property, including sacrificing slaves. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7181.02s)]
*  And so when Europeans began to settle the region, they weren't going to abide cannibalism and human sacrifice next door to them, and so they forced the Quokkutl to knock it off. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7185.18s)]
*  And what happened next, I mean, it sums up the whole process of progressive sublimation almost perfectly. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7193.9800000000005s)]
*  They would destroy blankets and food, and important men would compete by destroying these decorated pieces of copper that they called coppers [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7200.780000000001s)]
*  that were the most valuable items in the whole Quokkutl world. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7211.18s)]
*  One good copper would often be worth hundreds of blankets. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7213.18s)]
*  And so the aggressive nature of this kind of symbolic combat, it was right out in the open, and it was recognized by everybody. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7216.38s)]
*  This is a passage reported about an interaction that involved one of the white settlers named Charles Wilson, quote, [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7226.38s)]
*  And he threw the copper on the ground, saying, [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7232.38s)]
*  You. We have also heard that you are another one who doesn't want our nephew to change his position. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7235.18s)]
*  And here is another copper for you, and I am giving it to you to make you shut up. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7239.18s)]
*  They put these two coppers together, and he says to the young men to take these out to the deep water there and drown them. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7243.18s)]
*  That means that they want to drown old Wannock and Charlie Wilson. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7249.18s)]
*  That was why I warned you not to come near my house and wake the baby up, but since you have wakened him up, I will not let you do that. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7253.18s)]
*  And he cut half the top off and another corner from the bottom and gave one part of each to Mama Lelecala chiefs that threw their coppers into the water. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7261.9800000000005s)]
*  Then he says, [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7269.9800000000005s)]
*  Hap, hap, hap, I've eaten you. You are all in my belly now. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7271.9800000000005s)]
*  End quote. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7275.9800000000005s)]
*  So, he says, [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7277.9800000000005s)]
*  You. We have also heard that you are another one who doesn't want our nephew to change his position. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7279.9800000000005s)]
*  And so the aggressive nature of this kind of symbolic combat, it was right out in the open, and it was recognized by everybody. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7285.9800000000005s)]
*  End quote. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7290.78s)]
*  So, yeah, so after the settlers arrived and began to pressure the natives to stop all this, even the cannibal society modified its own behavior, and they did it themselves. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7292.78s)]
*  Instead of taking bites out of people, they would lift up a bit of the skin with their teeth and slice a tiny piece of skin off. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7302.78s)]
*  And instead of swallowing it, they would put it behind their ear and then run around all crazy like they do. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7308.78s)]
*  But then later on, they would come and they would come and give the piece of skin back just to let the person know that they weren't going to work any magic using it or something like that. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7313.58s)]
*  So these things are evolving. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7321.58s)]
*  I mean, right in front of Western anthropologists. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7323.58s)]
*  Franz Boas reported that the destruction of property was not only used against a person to harm the prestige or take revenge on another person, but it was also used as a replacement for other instances when sacrificing human beings normally would have been used. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7327.58s)]
*  End quote. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7343.58s)]
*  This is done mainly at the time when houses are built, when totem poles are erected, or when a son has been initiated by the spirit presiding over the secret society of his clan. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7345.58s)]
*  It seems that in olden times, slaves were sometimes killed and buried under the house posts or under totem poles. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7355.58s)]
*  Later on, instead of being killed, they were given away as presents. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7361.58s)]
*  Whenever this was done, the inverted figure of a man or an inverted head was placed on the pole. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7365.58s)]
*  In other cases, coppers were buried under the posts or given away. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7372.38s)]
*  This custom still continues. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7376.38s)]
*  He's writing this in, I think, 1895. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7378.38s)]
*  This custom still continues. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7380.38s)]
*  And in all such cases, coppers are shown on the post, often in such a way that they are being held or bitten by the totem animals, held in the mouth or bitten by the totem animals. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7382.38s)]
*  The property thus destroyed is called the Omaeu, the price paid for the house, the post, or the initiation. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7394.38s)]
*  So that's perfect. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7401.18s)]
*  It's a perfect illustration of what we're talking about. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7403.18s)]
*  They used to kill slaves and bury them under the pole. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7405.18s)]
*  Then they gave those slaves away as presents and attached the inverted figure of a man pointing down to the ground under the pole. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7407.18s)]
*  And then, lacking slaves, they gave away or put their valuable coppers in the ground where the slaves formerly would have been buried or else placed them in the mouths of the totem animal. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7415.18s)]
*  That is a step by step by step process, a sublimation that we were able to record in real time. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7425.9800000000005s)]
*  Stuff like this is to be found all over the world once you know where to look. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7433.9800000000005s)]
*  But you've got to know how to see through the outer forms to the level of being where everything is a symbol. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7437.9800000000005s)]
*  If you came across a tribe that dedicated a new totem pole or building by giving away valuable property at a great feast, it would look just as innocuous as Ursula Le Guin's joyful town of Omaeus. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7444.78s)]
*  But there's a child down in that basement. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7460.78s)]
*  And so, so soon after the switch over, the sublimation had been forced by the white settlers. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7465.58s)]
*  The Quack Udall themselves, this is the really interesting thing about it, is the Quack Udall themselves knew perfectly well the symbolic meaning of their acts. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7473.58s)]
*  Another anthropologist, Helen Kodary speaking, she spoke with a lot of Quack Udall informants, reported how many of them experienced their sublimation almost as a type of salvation. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7481.58s)]
*  The general conclusion is that the binding force of Quack Udall history was their limitless pursuit of a kind of social prestige which required continual proving to be established or maintained against rivals. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7512.38s)]
*  And that the main shift in Quack Udall history was from a time when success in warfare and head hunting was significant to the time when nothing counted but successful potlatching. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7524.38s)]
*  And now she's just direct quoting several of her native Quack Udall informants. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7534.38s)]
*  Quack Udall is a man of the blood of the Yaksa Elves. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7542.38s)]
*  But instead of fighting our enemies with his death bringer, we fight with these blankets and other kinds of property. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7546.38s)]
*  We are the Kaskemo, who have never been vanquished by any tribe, neither in wars of blood nor in wars of property. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7550.38s)]
*  Of olden times the Quack Udall ill-treated my forefathers and fought them so that the blood ran over the ground. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7556.38s)]
*  Now we fight with button blankets and other kinds of property, smiling at each other. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7562.38s)]
*  Oh, how good is the new time! [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7566.38s)]
*  We used to fight with bows and arrows, with spears and guns. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7569.18s)]
*  We robbed each other's blood. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7573.18s)]
*  But now we fight with this here, pointing at the copper that he's holding in his hand. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7575.18s)]
*  And if we have no coppers, we fight with canoes and blankets. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7579.18s)]
*  True is your word. When I was young I have seen streams of blood shed in war. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7585.18s)]
*  But since that time the white man came and stopped up that stream of blood with wealth. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7591.18s)]
*  Now we are fighting with our wealth. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7595.9800000000005s)]
*  The time of fighting has passed. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7599.9800000000005s)]
*  The Fool Dancer represents the warriors, but we do not fight now with weapons. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7601.9800000000005s)]
*  We fight with property. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7605.9800000000005s)]
*  And now this is back to the anthropologist's voice. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7607.9800000000005s)]
*  It would be difficult to exaggerate the degree to which the talk, the songs, and the ceremonies of potlatching [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7611.9800000000005s)]
*  borrowed the metaphor of war, and even developed it to the point where the metaphorical war [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7617.9800000000005s)]
*  had even more meaning and thoroughness than their one time fighting with weapons. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7622.78s)]
*  The usual word for potlatch was... [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7626.78s)]
*  I don't... I still don't know how to deal with these things. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7630.78s)]
*  I think it's a click, like a... [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7632.78s)]
*  The little exclamation point. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7634.78s)]
*  I'll just spell it for you. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7636.78s)]
*  It's P! E-S-A. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7638.78s)]
*  P-E-S-A? [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7640.78s)]
*  Anyway. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=7642.78s)]

*  children react when they think that they've been abandoned they don't react [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8506.94s)]

*  the image of a child off altogether and instead stepping on a glass at weddings [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8844.42s)]

*  earlier and you'll have noticed throughout this episode that the Aztecs [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8879.86s)]

*  to bear these are not tribes running around Papua New Guinea this demands an [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8890.86s)]
*  explanation but you know as with the rest of this episode all I can offer is [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8895.82s)]
*  speculation and it's speculation that is going to dovetail much more comfortably [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8900.46s)]
*  with the next episode on human sacrifice if I save most of it until until then and [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8905.42s)]
*  so that's what I'm going to do in some ways I mean think about it like this in [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8910.5s)]
*  some ways we're less shocked to learn that a primitive tribe in Papua New Guinea [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8916.3s)]
*  engaged in these bloody practices then we are to hear about it with the Aztecs [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8920.74s)]
*  it's less strange that that you know New Guinea tribe did it than it is that the [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8926.5s)]
*  Aztecs were doing it and we're fascinated with the Aztecs for the same reason we're [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8931.66s)]
*  fascinated with a character like Hannibal Lecter right people so [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8935.82s)]
*  sophisticated and obviously able to construct and maintain a complex and [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8941.42s)]
*  orderly world for themselves we think should not be capable of engaging in [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8945.94s)]
*  those kind of practices they don't seem to go together it seems somehow [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8950.42s)]
*  paradoxical for good reason you know serial killers don't die of old age very [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8953.82s)]
*  often some of them can kind of put on a reasonable social mask for a while but [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8959.82s)]
*  eventually their pathology starts to catch up with them you know they're [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8966.14s)]
*  always they're almost always loners and however successful they are at slipping [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8970.7s)]
*  through the nets that law enforcement puts out very few of them are able to [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8975.06s)]
*  maintain long-standing relationships without people starting to catch on to [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8978.66s)]
*  the fact that there's something going on with them civilized people are not [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8983.86s)]
*  supposed to gather beneath a pyramid to watch hearts being ripped out and then [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8989.22s)]
*  to eat the remains they're supposed to you know gather in movie theaters and [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8993.78s)]
*  watch hearts being ripped out with a little more psychological distance [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=8997.78s)]
*  right but you know as with children working their way through the [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9001.46s)]
*  psychosexual stages the question at all times is whether the subjects themselves [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9008.58s)]
*  feel comfortable and secure enough to leave behind a key support to their [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9013.66s)]
*  particular understanding of the world in favor of a substitute whether that [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9019.179999999998s)]
*  substitute will work for them and whether they have confidence it'll work [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9023.359999999999s)]
*  for them or if it won't whether or not they have a reason and the ability to [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9025.9s)]
*  simply repress it explanations for Aztec cannibalism there there are several and [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9030.94s)]
*  and again they they they go much better with the episode on human sacrifice so [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9038.94s)]
*  I'm gonna save them until then but explanations for cannibalism like the [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9045.26s)]
*  hypothesis that Mesoamerica just didn't have much in the way of animal protein [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9050.26s)]
*  lacking cattle and other stock animals so they just had no choice but to eat [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9054.26s)]
*  people that I just can't that ignores everything else literally everything [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9058.14s)]
*  else we know about cannibalism in other parts of the world which is why I spent [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9063.9s)]
*  this entire episode talking about those other places in those other cultures [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9067.18s)]
*  there's gonna be a lot more Aztecs coming up in the next two you know these [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9071.18s)]
*  people built an entire civilization and religion and everything around the [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9074.939999999999s)]
*  ritual sacrifice and cannibalization of other human beings who are culturally [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9080.76s)]
*  very similar to themselves something like that something so central to their [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9084.78s)]
*  cosmology and their social lives is not merely a form of cattle ranching with [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9090.5s)]
*  which we're not familiar okay it goes so much deeper than that for all their [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9094.86s)]
*  savagery for all their savagery I want to take it back to the you know near the [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9101.78s)]
*  beginning and remember what kind of world we live in the world of Job and our [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9109.060000000001s)]
*  Juneau we described near the beginning you know the Aztecs and any of these [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9114.7s)]
*  people that we've been speaking about they don't have theoretical books on [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9118.1s)]
*  natural science because like other peoples of similar social development [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9121.86s)]
*  the Aztecs still perceived and understood the world in terms of agency [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9126.740000000002s)]
*  action narrative mythology things like that it's how they understood the the [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9130.84s)]
*  the functions of the world they encoded their understanding of the cosmos not [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9136.380000000001s)]
*  in books to put on a library shelf they encoded their their cosmology in their [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9141.18s)]
*  entire cultural system you know all of us we all of us have to figure out how [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9145.34s)]
*  to navigate a world which constantly thwarts our attempts to assign stable [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9151.58s)]
*  meanings to it because our minds are meaning-making machines it's just this [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9156.26s)]
*  is our this is our glory and our curse it's what we do the world constantly [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9161.66s)]
*  dodges and thwarts our attempts to assign meaning but assigned meaning we [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9166.86s)]
*  shall over and over and over and over you know it's supposed to mean something [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9170.78s)]
*  that I love my family but eventually they will all die and so will I and so [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9175.980000000001s)]
*  will the children and grandchildren that I teach to value the same things my [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9181.060000000001s)]
*  attempts to bolster meaning by writing it in books and encoding it in stone and [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9186.18s)]
*  painting it on canvas all of that's gonna fade and rot away even if we build [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9191.1s)]
*  an entire civilization to keep our unique story of the universe going that [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9197.42s)]
*  civilization will fall and the Aztecs were extraordinarily aware of this it's [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9201.82s)]
*  gonna be a big theme in the next episode the Aztecs knew this as well as anybody [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9208.06s)]
*  they inhabited a landscape and a culture realm where where the land was littered [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9211.98s)]
*  with the ruins of cities greater than anything that they'd built themselves by [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9218.06s)]
*  people of whom they had no memory because they were wiped out before [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9222.14s)]
*  anybody could even remember what was going on the people who built Teotihuacan [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9225.939999999999s)]
*  are gone they got wiped out what do you think is gonna happen to us that is a [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9231.859999999999s)]
*  primary theme in all Aztec life you know the languages in which we record our [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9237.98s)]
*  myths are going to be forgotten as Mesoamerican Nahuatl has been mostly [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9245.54s)]
*  forgotten and probably will be completely someday and now you know [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9250.7s)]
*  thanks to modern science we understand like say the pre-christian Germanic [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9255.54s)]
*  tribes and many others that no matter what we do it all comes apart in the end [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9260.460000000001s)]
*  eventually the Sun blows up eventually the universe dies in heat death yet we [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9264.78s)]
*  have to live in this universe and the reflex of consciousness compels us to [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9270.26s)]
*  seek meaning in it who knows why life split off from the blind momentum of [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9274.18s)]
*  dead matter and charted its own course all we know is that once it did so it [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9280.9s)]
*  immediately started cannibalizing itself and using the life energy of you know [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9286.380000000001s)]
*  the life energy of whatever one part could get a hold of to bolster its [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9291.300000000001s)]
*  weapons and defenses against the other parts of course as we reflected life is [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9294.98s)]
*  not a completely closed system right the energy that supports it pours in [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9301.74s)]
*  from the Sun through the unconscious portal of vegetation seed-bearing plants [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9305.74s)]
*  and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it according to their kind [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9310.38s)]
*  as the Bible says the one other means by which energy enters the system is from [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9313.42s)]
*  the planet itself from the earth through the lichens and chemotrophs that suck up [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9319.86s)]
*  minute mineral nutrients from the ocean floor vents and and other openings in [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9323.46s)]
*  the earth right and then convert that into biomass and that's it those those [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9327.1s)]
*  are the ways in other than that it's a closed loop it's just life-eating life [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9332.78s)]
*  eating life at the top at the top of the templo mayor the Great Pyramid in the [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9337.220000000001s)]
*  center of the Aztec capital the top of it were two temples one each to the Sun [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9344.06s)]
*  God and the rain God the Sun impregnates the earth with its rays and the God [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9348.42s)]
*  Tlaloc released the rain which was equated on a one-to-one basis in Aztec [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9354.18s)]
*  cosmology with blood the blood of the gods who had sacrificed themselves at [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9358.619999999999s)]
*  the beginning of time to create life on earth and the goddess the earth goddess [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9362.859999999999s)]
*  was pictured as a decapitated corpse in her most famous Aztec representation with [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9368.779999999999s)]
*  two spurts of blood spraying out from her neck that was how they pictured the [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9375.5s)]
*  earth goddess and you wonder what the consequences are to believing that rather [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9381.380000000001s)]
*  than a big bang or or a spoken sentence of let there be light the founding event [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9386.74s)]
*  of the cosmos was an act of murder you wonder what type of society might grow [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9392.42s)]
*  out of such an idea you know perhaps perhaps a society in which the people [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9398.14s)]
*  believed that they had a debt a blood debt to the universe itself sunrays and [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9403.82s)]
*  and blood rain provided the energy of life but once you're inside those gates [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9412.74s)]
*  again in the kingdom of biology it is nothing but one big competition to see [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9417.5s)]
*  whose blood is gonna be repaid to keep the whole enterprise moving single [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9421.9s)]
*  celled creatures become multicellular multicellular creatures become animals [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9427.3s)]
*  and and flee the chaotic brutality of the ocean screaming on a dry land life [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9431.900000000001s)]
*  hid from itself and progressively larger and more adaptable forms until finally [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9439.1s)]
*  the one creature destined to rule woke up to what was happening and wondered what [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9444.1s)]
*  it meant for him this is the fall of man from the garden and we have been trying [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9449.26s)]
*  to find ways to mitigate its consequences for us ever since many [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9455.38s)]
*  answers that we've come up with are well there you understand they're [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9460.859999999999s)]
*  understandable but you know they're life-denying their world denying playing [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9466.82s)]
*  psychological tricks to pretend that it's not actually happening as many [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9470.779999999999s)]
*  Eastern philosophies do the Abrahamic religions they admit that it's happening [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9474.22s)]
*  but they say it doesn't really matter because the real show begins after we [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9479.339999999998s)]
*  pass through this nightmare into the afterlife anyway modern secular culture [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BXOdMWkFHo&t=9483.9s)]
