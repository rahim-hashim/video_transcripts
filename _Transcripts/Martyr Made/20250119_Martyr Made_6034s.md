The Second World War was the greatest catastrophe in human history. Sixty million people dead. Entire nations destroyed. All sides engaged in the wholesale slaughter of enemy civilian populations. And the nuclear demon unleashed upon the world. It was the war in which the United States and our allies conquered the world, and eighty years after Germany's defeat, the story of the war remains our civilization's most important load-bearing myth. Myths are stories told by the winners to legitimize their victory, but in real history the losers have their own story to tell. This series will explore the deep history of the Second World War through the eyes of the Enemy.

# #24 Enemy, Prologue: Enemies of All Mankind
**Martyr Made:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg)
*  Hey everybody, it's been too long. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=0.0s)]
*  This is Daryl Cooper and you're about to hear episode 24 of the Martyr Made Podcast. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  This is the first episode of a new series called Enemy, the German's War. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=14.84s)]
*  And as the title implies, we're going to be exploring the deep history of the Second World [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=22.32s)]
*  War through the eyes of the people who lost it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=26.22s)]
*  As many of you know, I got into some hot water recently for discussing this topic on the Tucker Carlson show. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=32.339999999999996s)]
*  If you are new to the show and haven't heard, there was about a week long freak out in 2024 [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  throughout the Western press that culminated in my being denounced by name in an official [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=48.14s)]
*  statement from the Biden White House. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=54.1s)]
*  I have been warned by people who would know that I should probably avoid traveling to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=57.660000000000004s)]
*  several European countries due to the possibility that I'll be arrested when my plane lands. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=62.82s)]
*  What did I say that got people so riled up? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=69.78s)]
*  The gist of it was that the Second World War might have been avoided if the allies, in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=73.22s)]
*  particular Britain, had taken a different approach to the belligerence of the Third [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=78.26s)]
*  Reich and that the allies helped create the conditions that allowed the Hitler regime [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=82.54s)]
*  to justify the atrocities committed by German forces during the war. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=88.06s)]
*  I hadn't planned on talking with Tucker about World War II, and I admit I went off a little [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=94.58000000000001s)]
*  half-cocked, allowing people, many of them in bad faith or ignorance, but some not, to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=99.9s)]
*  hear things that I wasn't saying, specifically that the Germans were innocent bystanders [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=108.02s)]
*  and that the Allies were to blame for all the bad things that happened from 1939 to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=112.46s)]
*  1945. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=117.94s)]
*  Never mind that I said at the time that I specifically was not saying that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=119.46s)]
*  Still, I knew I was walking on sacred ground with my shoes on, so I can't object too strongly [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=124.02s)]
*  when some people complained that I was tracking mud through the cathedral. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=131.74s)]
*  In any case, 20 minutes or so of an interview that up to that point had been focusing on [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=137.7s)]
*  entirely different topics was not the best way to engage with that topic. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=142.85999999999999s)]
*  So here we are. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=148.64s)]
*  We're going to go very deep in this series, as usual, and we're not going to stop until [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  we understand how a man like Adolf Hitler was formed, how he was formed from the raw [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=157.5s)]
*  material of what was once an innocent child. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=164.5s)]
*  We're not going to stop until we understand why the people of Germany would listen to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=169.22s)]
*  him and what were the historical circumstances that made following him seem like the most [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=172.74s)]
*  reasonable of the available options at the time for millions and millions of people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=180.46s)]
*  In short, what did the Germans believe they were doing? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  We all know our side of the story. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=193.12s)]
*  An evil man captivated a people who temporarily lost their minds. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=195.8s)]
*  He led them on a bloody quest for world domination, and humanity was saved by the effort and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=200.56s)]
*  sacrifice of the greatest generation of the enlightened nations of the world. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=206.36s)]
*  But history is a story lived and written by men and women, not by angels and demons. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=213.44s)]
*  When angels and demons start creeping into your narrative, you might be doing something [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=221.44s)]
*  important and worth doing, but you're not doing history. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=226.3s)]
*  The historian Timothy Snyder was one of the mainstream academics trotted out to attack [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=232.8s)]
*  me in the press after my appearance on the Tucker Carlson show. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=238.16s)]
*  So it's safe to say that he's no fan of mine, but I don't mind admitting that his book [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=242.2s)]
*  Europe Between Hitler and Stalin was an excellent read. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=247.6s)]
*  And in that book, Snyder says something with which I agree wholeheartedly and which will [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  be sort of the guiding light of this entire series. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=258.08s)]
*  Speaking of both Germany under Hitler and the Soviet Union under Stalin, Snyder writes, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=264.56s)]
*  Ideology, when stripped by time or partisanship of its political and economic connections, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=272.48s)]
*  becomes a moralizing form of explanation for mass killing, one that comfortably separates [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=279.56s)]
*  the people who explain from the people who kill. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=285.32s)]
*  It is convenient to see the perpetrator just as someone who holds the wrong idea and is [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  therefore different for that reason. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=294.44s)]
*  It is reassuring to ignore the importance of economics and the complications of politics, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=297.36s)]
*  factors that might in fact be common to historical perpetrators and those who later contemplate [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=303.8s)]
*  their actions. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=309.2s)]
*  It is far more inviting, at least today in the West, to identify with the victims than [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=310.56s)]
*  to understand the historical setting that they shared with perpetrators and bystanders. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=317.6s)]
*  The identification with the victim affirms a radical separation from the perpetrator. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=323.76s)]
*  The Treblinka guard who starts the engine or the NKVD officer who pulls the trigger [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=329.14s)]
*  is not me. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=334.32s)]
*  He is the person who kills someone like me. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  Yet it is unclear whether this identification with victims brings much knowledge or whether [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=340.8s)]
*  this kind of alienation from the murderer is an ethical stance. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=346.0s)]
*  It is not at all obvious that reducing history to morality plays makes anyone moral. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=351.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, claiming victim status does not itself bring sound ethical choices. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=357.92s)]
*  Stalin and Hitler both claimed throughout their political careers to be victims. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  They persuaded millions of other people that they too were victims of an international [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  capitalist or Jewish conspiracy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  During the German invasion of Poland, a German soldier believed that the death grimace of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=380.16s)]
*  a Pole proved that Poles irrationally hated Germans. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=384.62s)]
*  During the famine, a Ukrainian communist found himself beleaguered by the corpses of the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  starved at his doorstep. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=394.04s)]
*  They both portrayed themselves as victims. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  No major war or act of mass killing in the 20th century began without the aggressors [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=400.68s)]
*  or perpetrators first claiming innocence and victimhood. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=406.44s)]
*  The human capacity for subjective victimhood is apparently limitless, and people who believe [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=411.64s)]
*  that they are victims can be motivated to perform acts of great violence. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=416.76s)]
*  The Austrian policeman shooting babies at Mahillu imagined what the Soviets would do [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=421.82s)]
*  to his children. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=427.08s)]
*  The victims were people. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=430.32s)]
*  A true identification with them would involve grasping their lives rather than grasping [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=432.32s)]
*  at their deaths. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=437.54s)]
*  By definition, the victims are dead and unable to defend themselves from the use that others [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=440.08s)]
*  make of their deaths. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=445.15999999999997s)]
*  It is easy to sanctify policies or identities by the deaths of victims. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=447.64s)]
*  It is less appealing, but morally more urgent, to understand the actions of the perpetrators. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=452.6s)]
*  The moral danger, after all, is never that one might become a victim, but that one might [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=459.9s)]
*  be a perpetrator or a bystander. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=465.94s)]
*  It is tempting to say that a Nazi murderer is beyond the pale of understanding. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=468.73999999999995s)]
*  Outstanding politicians and intellectuals, for example, Edvard Benes and Ilya Ehrenberg, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=474.94s)]
*  yielded to this temptation during the war. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=481.02s)]
*  The Czechoslovak president and the Soviet Jewish writer were justifying revenge upon [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=484.12s)]
*  the Germans as such. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=489.06s)]
*  People who called others subhuman were themselves subhuman. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=491.97999999999996s)]
*  Yet to deny a human being his human character is to render ethics impossible. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=496.82s)]
*  To yield to this temptation, to find other people to be inhuman, is to take a step toward, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=503.26s)]
*  not away from, the Nazi position. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=510.29999999999995s)]
*  To find other people incomprehensible is to abandon the search for understanding, and [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=513.62s)]
*  thus to abandon history." [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=519.54s)]
*  The Second World War is the worst thing that ever happened, at least quantitatively speaking, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=525.62s)]
*  at least in modern history. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=533.18s)]
*  Sixty million people dead. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=536.26s)]
*  Entire nations destroyed. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=539.22s)]
*  All sides engaged in the wholesale slaughter of enemy civilian populations. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=542.7s)]
*  And of course, the nuclear demon unleashed upon the world. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=547.9000000000001s)]
*  The entire world, including the quote unquote good guys, lost its mind for a few years. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=554.1400000000001s)]
*  The main lesson taken from the war that sometimes a bad guy pops up and starts causing trouble, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=562.94s)]
*  and we just have no choice but to tool up and do whatever is necessary to take him out. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=570.14s)]
*  That has turned out to be a convenient justification for pretty much every war the United States [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=575.5s)]
*  has fought since 1945, and the official narrative surrounding World War II has been protected [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=580.26s)]
*  in large part to protect that justification. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=587.74s)]
*  But what if that's not the right lesson? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=592.58s)]
*  When I was nearing the end of the Jonestown series, I managed to get my hands on a stack [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=596.58s)]
*  of police reports of incidents involving someone, usually a husband or father, holding his family [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=601.5400000000001s)]
*  hostage in a standoff with police. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=609.22s)]
*  Most of the incidents involved drugs, and the overwhelming majority of those involved [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=613.98s)]
*  methamphetamines, and for each incident I read about in the reports, I found what I [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=617.62s)]
*  could in newspapers and other media sources. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=622.14s)]
*  Some of these incidents ended peacefully. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=626.6999999999999s)]
*  Some others ended with the death of the hostage taker at the hands of police. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=629.9399999999999s)]
*  But nearly half ended when the man murdered his family and then killed himself. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=635.62s)]
*  Jim Jones, as those of you who have listened to the Martyr Made series, God's Socialist [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=641.66s)]
*  was hopped up on amphetamines pretty much every day for about 10 years leading up to [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=648.06s)]
*  the murder, suicide and Guiana. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=652.3399999999999s)]
*  I had read enough about the delusional and often violent paranoia often caused by long-term [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=655.5s)]
*  amphetamine use that I expected to learn something from those police reports about what happened [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=662.3s)]
*  at Jonestown in 1978, and I was right, I did. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=667.38s)]
*  One of the things I learned from those reports that influenced the way I understood the Jonestown [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=672.8199999999999s)]
*  story was that the behavior of the police was not the same in every case. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=676.86s)]
*  Some clearly understood the explosive and unpredictable nature of the circumstances [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=684.1400000000001s)]
*  they were in, and they did their job by trying at every point to de-escalate the situation. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=689.86s)]
*  Other police were clumsy and out of their depth, but in some cases there was simply [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=698.3000000000001s)]
*  no getting around the fact that in a standoff with a psychotic man, delusional man threatening [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=703.78s)]
*  to murder his family, the police acted in ways that made the situation worse. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=710.9399999999999s)]
*  They used threats, they used pressure tactics, some even insulted or tried to humiliate the [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=717.78s)]
*  man inside the house with a gun, maybe just hoping to shake him up and get him to expose [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=725.9s)]
*  himself, maybe just because cops are human beings too, and they were tired and frustrated [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=732.5s)]
*  and angry themselves. Whatever the reason, you read through the reports and they clearly [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=738.74s)]
*  acted in ways that made the situation more dangerous, often with catastrophic consequences. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=745.5s)]
*  Now are the cops who behaved this way responsible for the tragedies that followed? Obviously [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=753.82s)]
*  they were not holding the family hostage and they did not pull the trigger on the murder [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=761.82s)]
*  weapon, so in that sense, no, obviously they were not the ones responsible. We don't know [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=766.2600000000001s)]
*  what would have happened if the cops had taken a more de-escalatory approach. It's certainly [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=774.0200000000001s)]
*  possible that things would have ended the same way. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=779.62s)]
*  Still, when the worst possible outcome occurs, it would be totally inappropriate for the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=783.5s)]
*  police to throw their hands up and say there's nothing we could have done. This guy was crazy, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=790.9000000000001s)]
*  he was going to do what he was going to do, and any discussion of what we might have done [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=798.5600000000001s)]
*  differently really just deflects blame away from the real culprit. Even if that's true, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=802.9000000000001s)]
*  a responsible police department would study every single action its officers took, playing [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=811.34s)]
*  out every counterfactual to try to understand what happened. For understandable reasons, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=817.36s)]
*  only one counterfactual is usually permitted in polite discourse when something like this [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=825.92s)]
*  happens, namely that of the cop who was saying all along that the murder-suicide might have [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=830.52s)]
*  been prevented if only people had listened to him and sent the SWAT team in right away. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=836.92s)]
*  In World War II, in that version of this story, that cop is Winston Churchill. And he might [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=844.0s)]
*  have been right. Once the man inside kills his family, anyone arguing that the police [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=852.0s)]
*  should have been more conciliatory is not going to find very many sympathetic ears. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=859.0s)]
*  But the lessons we take from the last crisis inform our response to the next one, and too [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=866.24s)]
*  often our pride and our need to rationalize our decisions causes us to learn the wrong [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=872.12s)]
*  lessons. The lesson taken from Jonestown, for example, was that the tragedy might have [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=878.5600000000001s)]
*  been averted if the authorities had taken harsher and more decisive action, and this [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=885.48s)]
*  lesson shaped the catastrophic official response to the Branch Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=890.08s)]
*  fifteen years later. World War II has cast a similar spell on us for eighty years. Again, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=896.14s)]
*  virtually every war on which the US has embarked in the years since has been justified by claims [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=905.38s)]
*  that the enemy leader is the next Hitler, and that our only two choices are to fight [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=911.8199999999999s)]
*  him now or to fight him later when he's even stronger and more dangerous. You can be Winston [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=917.5s)]
*  Churchill or you can be that cowardly, sniveling Neville Chamberlain. Advocating de-escalation [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=924.06s)]
*  is just naive appeasement that inappropriately humanizes and legitimizes a monster. It's [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=932.26s)]
*  a very clever rhetorical jiu-jitsu that frames the people advocating for peace as the ones [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=941.26s)]
*  who were actually advocating for a bigger and more violent war. The pundit Barry Weiss [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=947.56s)]
*  called Tulsi Gabbard an Assad toady on the Joe Rogan experience, attacking her moral [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=954.0s)]
*  character, but also effectively accusing her of treason simply because Tulsi was advocating [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=961.16s)]
*  for de-escalation of the Syrian Civil War. When Dr. Ron Paul pointed out that Osama Bin Laden's [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=967.6199999999999s)]
*  own words confirmed that US military intervention in the Middle East was fueling Al-Qaeda's [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=975.42s)]
*  hostility toward us, Rudy Giuliani called Dr. Paul dangerous, accused him of blaming [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=981.2s)]
*  America rather than the terrorists for 9-11. These tactics work less and less often, and [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=987.98s)]
*  most of you will have seen through the cynical abuse of language by Weiss and Giuliani in [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=995.86s)]
*  these examples, but they remain powerful when it comes to World War II, the ermith [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1000.68s)]
*  of the American-led global order. In the early days of the war, the BBC broadcaster [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1007.68s)]
*  Cyril Jode was discussing with a friend whether Britain ought to accept Hitler's offer to [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1015.76s)]
*  come to the table to talk peace. Author Nicholson Baker writes, quote, Cyril asked whether [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1021.2199999999999s)]
*  his friend thought Chamberlain should have negotiated after Hitler's peace offer. Yes, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1029.06s)]
*  of course, said his friend. Wars should never be begun, and as soon as they were begun, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1034.02s)]
*  they should be stopped. He then listed off many war evils, the physical and moral mutilation, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1039.6000000000001s)]
*  the intolerance, the public lying, the enthronement of the mob. Once a war has started, he said, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1046.7s)]
*  the only thing was to get it stopped as soon as possible. Consequently, I should negotiate [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1054.26s)]
*  with Hitler. Jode said, ah, but you couldn't negotiate with Hitler, because you couldn't [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1060.46s)]
*  trust him. Hitler would break any agreement as soon as it benefited him to do so. Suppose [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1066.18s)]
*  you're right, said his friend. Suppose that Hitler violated the peace agreement and England [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1072.26s)]
*  had to go back to war. What had they lost? If worst comes to worst, we can always begin [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1077.4s)]
*  the killing again. Even a day of peace was a day of peace. Jode found no ready answer [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1083.88s)]
*  for that. End quote. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1091.2800000000002s)]
*  I'm not going to spend this series preaching to you about peace. This is a series about [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1094.76s)]
*  war, about a titanic conflict the likes of which the world had never seen and probably [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1101.76s)]
*  will not see again for another thousand years. It's a story that will be told through the [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1108.68s)]
*  eyes of those who planned it and carried it out, and of those who suffered its consequences. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1115.0s)]
*  I'd like to thank everybody who stood by me during the furor, no pun intended, that [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1122.16s)]
*  erupted after my appearance on Tucker's show. You never want to put your friends and supporters [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1129.88s)]
*  to a loyalty test, but sometimes one is forced on them. And I have to say it was very gratifying [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1136.0400000000002s)]
*  to learn that all of my friends really are, in fact, my friends. Not a single person with [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1143.2s)]
*  whom I had even a passing relationship spoke ill of me, even though there were rewards [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1150.28s)]
*  to be had for anyone who wanted to grab them. And I especially want to thank people like [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1156.08s)]
*  Jaco, somebody who has businesses and employees who depend on him and did not ask for the [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1161.72s)]
*  drama brought by his association with me after that interview. It would have been very easy [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1168.72s)]
*  for him to disavow me, and given his responsibilities I would have understood if he did. But he [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1174.56s)]
*  did not. Neither did Tucker, neither did anyone else. And that's something I won't ever forget. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1182.1599999999999s)]
*  Finally this is where I make an appeal for your support. The forces that came after me [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1191.0s)]
*  in the wake of the Tucker interview were pretty daunting. And the only reason, the only reason [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1196.1s)]
*  I was able to survive it and continue to speak my mind is you. My subscribers for just a [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1202.52s)]

*  It is a place. It is somewhere. Hell does exist. But its reference is to something that [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1346.72s)]
*  transcends all thinking. I ask why we must tear ourselves apart for this small question [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1356.76s)]
*  of religion. The following passage is from a book written by a German writer, a German [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1368.2s)]
*  Jewish American publisher named Theodore Kaufman. It was published in March 1941, three months [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1376.72s)]
*  before Germany invaded the Soviet Union and began its career of atrocities on the Eastern [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1384.8s)]
*  Front and nine months before the Pearl Harbor attack that drew the United States into the [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1390.04s)]
*  war. Kaufman's book was called Germany Must Perish and it begins like this, quote, today's [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1395.1200000000001s)]
*  war is not a war against Adolf Hitler, nor is it a war against the Nazis. It is a war [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1402.12s)]
*  of peoples against peoples of civilized peoples envisioning light against uncivilized barbarians [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1409.6399999999999s)]
*  who cherish darkness. It is a struggle between the German nation and humanity. Hitler is [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1416.84s)]
*  no more to be blamed for this German war than was the Kaiser for the last war. Hitler is [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1424.12s)]
*  not the last one, nor Bismarck before the Kaiser. These men did not originate or wage [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1432.12s)]
*  Germany's wars against the world. They were merely the mirrors reflecting centuries-old [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1437.9599999999998s)]
*  inbred lust of the German nation for conquest and mass murder. This war is being waged by [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1443.9199999999998s)]
*  the German people. It is they who are responsible. It is they who must be made to pay for the [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1450.9199999999998s)]
*  war. Otherwise, there will always be a German war against the world. For not only must there [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1457.44s)]
*  be no more German wars in fact, there must not even remain the slightest possibility [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1466.16s)]
*  of one ever again occurring. A final halt to German aggression, not a temporary cessation, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1471.56s)]
*  must be the goal of the present struggle. This does not mean armed mastery over Germany [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1479.2s)]
*  or a peace with political or territorial adjustments, or a hope based on a defeated and repentant [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1485.28s)]
*  nation. Such settlements are not sufficiently conclusive guarantees of no more German aggressions. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1491.04s)]

One does not hate those whose souls can exude no spiritual warmth. One pities them. If the German people wish to live by themselves in darkness, it would be strictly their own affair. But when they make constant attempts to [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1699.5s)]

*  of its peoples is no political belief. It is a fierce and burning gospel of hate and [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1756.58s)]
*  intolerance, of murder and destruction and the unloosing of a sadistic bloodlust. It [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1762.3799999999999s)]

*  When an individual commits premeditated murder, he must be prepared to forfeit his own life [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1815.82s)]

*  prepared to forfeit its own national life. On that point the laws of man and God are [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1827.26s)]
*  explicit. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life. But what is the [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1833.42s)]
*  law of man or God to Germany? Nothing. She recognizes only German law. So be it. It must [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1840.58s)]
*  then be German law, if such a law there be, which decrees her penalty, the penalty of [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1849.5s)]
*  death. There remains now but to determine the best way, the most practical and expeditious [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1855.14s)]
*  manner in which the ultimate penalty must be levied upon the German nation. Quite naturally, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1861.62s)]
*  massacre and wholesale execution must be ruled out as impractical when applied to a population [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1868.5s)]
*  of some 70 million. There remains then but one mode of ridding the world forever of Germanism, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1873.76s)]
*  and that is to stem the source from which issue those war-lusted souls, by preventing [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1880.8999999999999s)]
*  the people of Germany from ever again reproducing their kind. This modern method, known to science [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1886.2s)]
*  as eugenic sterilization, is at once practical, humane and thorough. Sterilization has become [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1893.3600000000001s)]
*  a byword of science, as the best means of ridding the human race of its misfits, the [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1900.68s)]

*  It is a safe and simple operation, quite harmless and painless, neither mutilating nor unsexing [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1914.08s)]
*  the patient. Its effects are most often less distressing than vaccination, and no more [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1920.4399999999998s)]
*  serious than a tooth extraction. Two, the operation is extremely rapid, requiring no [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1925.96s)]
*  more than 10 minutes to complete. The patient may resume his work immediately afterwards. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1932.36s)]
*  Even in the case of the female, the operation, though taking longer to perform, is as safe [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1939.28s)]
*  and simple. Performed thousands of times, no records indicate cases of complication [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1944.0s)]
*  or death. When one realizes that such health measures as vaccination and serum treatments [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1950.08s)]
*  are considered as direct benefits to the community, certainly sterilization of the German people [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1956.32s)]
*  cannot but be considered a great health measure promoted by humanity to immunize itself forever [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1962.02s)]
*  against the virus of Germanism. The population of Germany, excluding conquered and annexed [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1968.44s)]
*  territories, is about 70 million, almost equally divided between male and female. To achieve [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1975.44s)]
*  the purpose of German extinction, it would be necessary only to sterilize some 48 million, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1981.44s)]
*  a figure which excludes because of their limited power to procreate, males over 60 years of [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1987.4s)]
*  age, and females over 45. Concerning the males subject to sterilization, the army groups [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=1993.36s)]
*  as organized units would be the easiest and quickest to deal with. Taking 20,000 surgeons [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2000.52s)]
*  as an arbitrary number, and on the assumption that each will perform a minimum of 25 operations [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2006.96s)]
*  daily, it would take no more than one month at the maximum to complete their sterilization. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2012.44s)]
*  Naturally the more doctors available, and many more than the 20,000 we mentioned would [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2019.64s)]
*  be available considering all the nations to be drawn upon, the less time would be required. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2024.44s)]
*  The balance of the male civilian population of Germany could be treated within three months. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2031.02s)]
*  Inasmuch as sterilization of women needs somewhat more time, it may be computed that the entire [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2036.92s)]
*  female population of Germany could be sterilized within a period of three years or less. Complete [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2042.5s)]
*  sterilization of both sexes, and not only one, is to be considered necessary in view [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2048.56s)]
*  of the present German doctrine that so much as one drop of true German blood constitutes [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2054.0s)]
*  a German. Of course, after complete sterilization, there will cease to be a birth rate in Germany. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2059.1s)]
*  At the normal death rate of 2% per annum, German life will diminish at the rate of 1.5 [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2067.1s)]
*  million yearly. Accordingly, in the span of two generations, that which cost millions [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2072.8s)]
*  of lives and centuries of useless effort, namely the elimination of Germanism and its [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2078.6000000000004s)]
*  carriers, will have been an accomplished fact. By virtue of its loss of self-perpetuation, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2083.8s)]
*  German will will have atrophied and German power reduced to negligible importance. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2091.4s)]
*  Reviewing the foregoing case of sterilization, we find that several factors resulting from [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2098.48s)]
*  it firmly establish its advocacy. Firstly, no physical pain will be imposed upon the [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2102.76s)]
*  inhabitants of Germany through its application, a decidedly more humane treatment than they [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2108.8s)]
*  will have deserved. Secondly, execution of the plan would in no way disorganize the present [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2113.86s)]
*  population nor would it cause any sudden mass upheavals and dislocations. The consequent [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2120.28s)]
*  gradual disappearance of the Germans from Europe will leave no more negative effect [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2126.6s)]
*  upon that continent than did the gradual disappearance of the Indians upon this one. Thus shall we [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2131.2400000000002s)]
*  throw Germany into the oblivion which she would have visited upon the world. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2137.82s)]
*  Kaufman's book received little attention from the American general public, but it was reviewed [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2146.52s)]
*  by Time Magazine, the New York Times, and many other major publications. In fact, the [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2151.6s)]
*  Washington Post said the book advocated a provocative theory interestingly presented. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2157.68s)]

*  was being confirmed by the appearance of a book like this, written by a Jewish author [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2296.58s)]
*  and reviewed in Jewish-owned newspapers like the New York Times and the Washington Post. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2301.18s)]
*  Propaganda newspapers and magazines in Germany were filled with quoted passages from the [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2308.02s)]
*  book, as well as other anti-German articles and statements in the British and American [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2312.98s)]

*  party, already believed that losing the war would likely result in a peace even more punitive [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2325.82s)]
*  than the hated Versailles Treaty. But now many of them were forced to admit that the [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2331.7s)]
*  party may not have been exaggerating when it claimed that the Allied war aim was the [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2336.3s)]
*  total destruction of Germany and its people. Party propagandists found no shortage of anti-German [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2340.6600000000003s)]
*  vitriol in the British and American press, and they filled their newspapers and magazines [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2349.26s)]
*  with excerpts and commentary. Typical was a letter to the editor of a British newspaper [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2353.8s)]
*  from August 1940, which read, To be frank, I favor exterminating every living creature [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2359.42s)]

*  ruling regime, it seemed obvious that such a statement, although it was presented merely [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2388.1s)]
*  as the thoughts of one man, would not have been printed in a national newspaper unless [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2393.2999999999997s)]

*  writer Frances Partridge and her husband Ralph got a letter from an old friend and fellow [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2411.56s)]
*  writer Gerald Brennan. In the letter Brennan was complaining about pacifists who were [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2416.9s)]
*  advocating for peace with Germany, writing that they were unable to even grasp simple [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2423.1s)]

*  question in the fourth year of this gigantic struggle is astonishing. They cannot or will [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2467.14s)]
*  not see that this war is a war of the Jewish race and its subject people against Western [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2473.5s)]
*  culture and civilization. Everything that we Germans and Europeans, defenders of the [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2479.2400000000002s)]
*  principle of a moral world order, hold dear is at risk. The above-mentioned circles are [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2484.98s)]
*  too inclined to see the Jewish question as a humanitarian issue. They make their judgments [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2490.82s)]
*  on the feelings of the moment rather than on the knowledge and insight resulting from [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2496.02s)]
*  clear and calm reason. It is clear that if during this war we show the least weakening [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2500.34s)]
*  of our determination to resolve the Jewish question, the result will be the gravest danger [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2506.78s)]
*  to our people and Reich and all of Europe. Jewry wanted this war. Whether one looks to [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2512.02s)]
*  the plutocratic or the Bolshevist side of the enemy camp, one sees Jews standing in [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2520.1s)]
*  the foreground as instigators, rabble-rousers, and slave drivers. They organize the enemy's [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2525.58s)]
*  war economy and encourage plans to exterminate and destroy the Axis powers. England and the [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2531.7799999999997s)]
*  USA recruit from among them the bloodthirsty and vengeful agitators and political lunatics, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2538.8199999999997s)]
*  and they are the source of the terror commissars of the Soviet GPU. They are the mortar that [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2544.7799999999997s)]
*  holds the enemy coalition together. In the National Socialist Reich, they see a power [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2550.7s)]
*  that resists their drive for world domination, both militarily and intellectually. That explains [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2556.7799999999997s)]
*  their rage and deep hatred. Do not think that the Old Testament tirades of their newspapers [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2563.2799999999997s)]
*  and radio are merely political propaganda. They would carry it all out to the letter [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2569.3599999999997s)]
*  should they have the opportunity. Our state's security requires that we take whatever measures [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2575.2599999999998s)]
*  seem necessary to protect the German community from their threat. That leads to some difficult [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2581.24s)]
*  decisions, but they are unavoidable if we are to deal with the threat. This war is a [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2587.18s)]
*  racial war. The Jews started it and they direct it. Their goal is to destroy and exterminate [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2593.04s)]
*  our people. We are the only force standing between Jewry and world domination. If the [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2600.56s)]
*  Axis powers lose the war in Europe, no power on earth could save Europe from the Jewish [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2607.84s)]
*  Bolshevist flood. It may seem surprising that such a small minority possesses such great [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2613.2799999999997s)]
*  power and is such a deadly danger, but it is so. International Jewry uses certain criminal [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2619.44s)]
*  methods to gain world domination that are not evident to uneducated nations. The same [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2626.48s)]
*  is true in private life. The Jews do not enjoy economic success because they are more intelligent [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2632.04s)]
*  than non-Jews, rather because they follow a different moral code. They attempt to conceal [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2637.62s)]
*  their methods for as long as possible until it is too late for the affected nation to [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2643.6s)]
*  defend itself. Then it takes a revolution to dislodge them. We know how difficult and [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2647.94s)]
*  tiresome that is. None of the Fuhrer's prophetic words have come so inevitably true as his [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2654.4s)]
*  prediction that if Jewry succeeded in provoking a second world war, the result would not be [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2661.6800000000003s)]
*  the annihilation of the Aryan race, rather the end of the Jewish race. This process is [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2667.44s)]
*  of vast importance and will have unforeseeable consequences, but it can no longer be halted. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2673.8s)]
*  It must only be guided in the right direction. One must also be sure to strike the weapon [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2680.42s)]
*  of public deception from Jewry's hands, which it is desperately using to save its skin. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2686.14s)]
*  One can already see that in the face of approaching catastrophe, the Jews are shrinking into the [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2692.2200000000003s)]
*  background. They send their pet goy to the Fuhrer, and it will not be long before they [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2697.02s)]
*  do not want to do it any longer and wash their hands in innocence. The Jews will have to [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2702.66s)]
*  answer for their countless crimes against the happiness and peace of mankind, and one [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2708.66s)]
*  day the whole world will give them the penalty that they are suffering today in Germany. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2713.74s)]
*  We speak without resentment. The time is too grave to spin naive plans of revenge. This [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2719.42s)]
*  is a world problem of the First Order that can be solved by the present generation and [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2726.46s)]
*  must be solved by them. Sentimental considerations will have no part here. We see Jewry as the [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2731.02s)]
*  embodiment of a general world decline. Either we will break this danger, or the peoples [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2737.86s)]
*  of the world will break under it. When dealing with the Jews, there are only two choices, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2743.7400000000002s)]
*  to surrender to them or to fight them. We have chosen the latter. As our enemy attacks [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2749.98s)]
*  without mercy, so do we. The future will prove who is right. Development so far, however, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2756.1800000000003s)]
*  seems to be more in our favor than the enemy's. Opposition to the Jews, not friendship with [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2763.18s)]
*  them, is growing around the world. We are convinced that at the end of the war, Jewry [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2769.06s)]
*  will face a humanity that fully understands the Jewish question. One has to grant that [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2774.14s)]
*  extraordinarily clever tactics are being used, and that it takes some intelligence or sound [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2781.1s)]
*  instincts to see behind the Jewish façade. But here, too, the jug carries water until [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2786.5s)]
*  it breaks. International Jewry's attack on the cultural and moral order of the world [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2792.52s)]
*  is cleverly concealed, but not cleverly enough so that it cannot be seen through. One must [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2798.12s)]
*  keep at their heels and give them no rest when they begin to tire. They are virtuosos [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2805.0s)]
*  at the art of transformation. They can appear in a thousand forms, yet are always the same. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2810.92s)]
*  If one has caught them, they claim injured innocence and send their guard of pity on [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2817.52s)]
*  ahead to beg for mercy. But if one extends them even a finger of pity, they chop off [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2821.52s)]
*  the whole hand. They must therefore be kept in the fear of the Lord. We know that they [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2827.8s)]
*  hate us from the depths of their souls. We take pleasure in their hatred. There is nothing [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2835.12s)]
*  that they would not do to us if they had the power. We cannot therefore give them even [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2841.28s)]
*  the slightest bit of power. More than that, it is our duty to tell the world of their [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2846.84s)]
*  nature and their depravity. We must again and again prove their sick role in beginning [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2852.38s)]
*  and carrying on this war. We must attack them incessantly, accuse them without pity of the [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2857.6800000000003s)]
*  crimes of which they are guilty, until the nations begin to wake up. That may take a [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2863.44s)]
*  long time, but it is worth it. We are dealing with the most dangerous enemy that ever threatened [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2869.1400000000003s)]
*  the life, freedom, and dignity of humanity. There can be no mercy. We have pity only for [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2876.46s)]
*  the countless millions of our own people and those of the other European nations who will [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2883.46s)]
*  be given over to the hate and destructive will of the devilish race if we become weak [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2888.1s)]
*  and give up the battle. Those Philistines who today are so eager to protect the Jews [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2894.2999999999997s)]
*  would be their first victims. We must all keep alert. We must be on guard against the [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2900.22s)]
*  insidious cleverness of the international world enemy. In the depths of his soul, he [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2905.94s)]
*  realizes that this war that he so frivolously began, expecting it to be the last step toward [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2911.78s)]
*  world domination, has instead become a war for his racial existence. He desperately seeks [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2917.66s)]
*  to stop the inevitable march of events. It will do him no good. We will keep at him. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2924.1s)]
*  In the end, the Fuhrer's prophecy about world Jewry in 1939, which they laughed at then, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2931.66s)]
*  will come true. The Jews laughed in Germany too when they first saw us. They are not laughing [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2938.1s)]
*  any longer. When they planned a war to totally destroy the German nation, they signed their [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2945.22s)]
*  own death warrant. Here too, history will be the world court. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2951.7799999999997s)]
*  War is a great evil, not only because of the destruction of human lives and property. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2961.1s)]
*  As catastrophic as these losses are, and at the risk of sounding insensitive to those [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2969.7799999999997s)]
*  who have suffered through war, populations and property can be replaced and rebuilt. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2975.66s)]
*  Often more lasting is the devastation war inflicts on the souls of those under its spell. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2984.22s)]
*  The rhetoric of Goebbels and Kaufmann is not remarkable because it was unique or even rare, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2990.82s)]
*  but because this is how people at war, who are seeking war, talk about each other. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=2997.86s)]
*  One need only look at the rhetoric from both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3005.5s)]
*  since the attack of October 7, 2023. People often ask me why that conflict gets me more [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3009.5s)]
*  animated than a civil war in Sudan. There are several reasons, such as the fact that [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3016.3s)]
*  I know a lot more people involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and I know more about the conflict [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3022.86s)]
*  itself, and the fact that my own country has a great deal of negative influence in that [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3028.86s)]

*  In his haunting book, Human Smoke, author Nicholson Baker writes about a memo distributed [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3337.22s)]
*  by the British air staff on March 6, 1941, titled Chemical Bored Crop Subcommittee, First [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3344.4199999999996s)]
*  Report, quote, It discussed the possibility of dropping weed seeds, bugs, and plant diseases [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3352.22s)]
*  on Axis crops. Such attacks might have a moral effect on the German population, it was contended. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3360.22s)]
*  Another idea was to kill crops or stunt their growth using substances developed by Imperial [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3368.22s)]
*  Chemical Industries, the English company that made bombs and Runcall brand sprayable mustard [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3373.22s)]

*  root crops. In 1941, their use by aerial distribution over Germany was envisaged, a later memo said, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3387.4199999999996s)]

*  At same day, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met with Air Marshal Charles Portal, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3399.14s)]
*  Chief of Staff of the Royal Air Force. Churchill by this point knew that the only way Britain [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3405.3799999999997s)]
*  had a chance of winning the war was if the Americans could somehow be drawn into it. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3411.5s)]
*  And to that end, he told his cabinet explicitly that he was actively seeking ways to provoke [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3417.62s)]
*  the Germans to drastic action against Britain. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3423.06s)]
*  Germany by this point was beginning to focus on the East and not to abandon the war in [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3427.98s)]
*  the West, but it was certainly de-emphasized. And Churchill believed that the propaganda [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3434.42s)]
*  effect on the American public of German atrocities against Britain would be a greater gain than [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3440.54s)]
*  whatever was lost to the German attacks. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3445.66s)]
*  Baker writes, quote, Churchill asked Portal to see if he could try something a little [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3449.7799999999997s)]
*  different using some special weapons. They tried it before, back in the summer, just [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3455.14s)]
*  after France fell, but it hadn't worked all that well. Maybe they should give it another [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3460.62s)]
*  chance. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3465.54s)]
*  The weapons to be used weren't bombs, exactly. They were leaflets without words. The British [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3467.3s)]
*  called them calling cards. They were about the size of a playing card, maybe a little [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3473.18s)]
*  smaller, and they were made of a phosphorus wafer held between two layers of moist fabric. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3478.7s)]
*  When the fabric dried out in the sun, the phosphorus caught fire. There were other shapes [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3484.5s)]
*  and configurations. Sometimes they were coated with a plastic substance that cracked when [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3489.96s)]
*  it dried. When it cracked, the wafer burned. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3494.54s)]
*  What might these fire sandwiches set alight? Grain? They'd tried that already. Churchill's [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3499.14s)]
*  thoughts turned to the Black Forest. In fact, why not burn down all the forests of Germany? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3505.86s)]
*  They began on a Monday night, September 2, 1940, but the Air Ministry held back the news [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3512.86s)]
*  for two days. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3518.54s)]
*  Woods are bombed, was the headline in the New York Times. RAF bombers have unleashed [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3520.5s)]
*  a devastating attack with incendiary bombs on the famous Black Forest east of Baden, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3525.94s)]

*  lived a legendary giant. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3558.28s)]
*  I was telling the other chaps in my plane about it as we were flying over it, he said. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3559.88s)]
*  Near the railway line that went up the giant's mountain, bombs started. A nice new little [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3565.2400000000002s)]

*  Given its ubiquity throughout human history, it is hard to say that war is unnatural. And [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3578.52s)]
*  if it is natural, then the demands it places upon us must in some way be natural too. But [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3585.04s)]
*  I think it's safe to say that when you've descended to the point of trying to burn down [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3592.04s)]
*  ancient forests, more or less out of spite, that something essential in your humanity [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3596.0s)]

*  something like this. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3635.9s)]
*  But soon of course we were in it. And along with everyone else, we submitted to the logic [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3639.42s)]
*  of a conflict in which whole peoples were considered acceptable casualties in pursuit [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3644.46s)]
*  of victory. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3649.66s)]

*  In the summer of 1943, during a long heat wave, the RAF, supported by the U.S. Eighth Army [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3660.74s)]
*  Air Force, flew a series of raids over Hamburg. The aim of Operation Gamora, as it was called, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3667.22s)]
*  was to destroy the city and reduce it as completely as possible to ashes. In a raid early in the [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3674.78s)]
*  morning of July 27th, beginning at 1 a.m., 10,000 tons of high explosive and incendiary [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3681.42s)]
*  bombs were dropped on the densely populated residential area east of the Elbe, comprising [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3687.78s)]
*  the districts of Hammerbrook, Hamnord and Hamsud, Bielwerd-Auschlag, and parts of St. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3693.3s)]
*  Georg, Eilbeck, Barmbeck, and Wannsbeck. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3699.62s)]
*  A now familiar sequence of events occurred. First, all the doors and windows were torn [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3703.3s)]
*  from their frames and smashed by high explosive bombs weighing 4,000 pounds. Then the attic [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3709.06s)]
*  floors of the buildings were ignited by lightweight incendiary mixtures, and at the same time [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3715.1s)]
*  fire bombs weighing up to 15 kilograms fell into the lower stories. Within a few minutes, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3720.2999999999997s)]
*  huge fires were burning all over the target area, which covered some 20 square kilometers, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3727.2999999999997s)]
*  and they merged so rapidly that only a quarter of an hour after the first bombs had dropped, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3733.22s)]
*  the whole airspace was a sea of flames as far as the eye could see. Another five minutes [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3738.5s)]
*  later at 1 20 a.m., a firestorm of an intensity that no one would ever before have thought [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3744.54s)]
*  possible arose. The fire, now rising 2,000 meters into the sky, snatched oxygen to itself [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3750.46s)]
*  so violently that the air currents reached hurricane force, resonating like mighty organs [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3757.76s)]
*  with all the stops pulled out at once. The fire burned like this for three hours. At [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3763.26s)]
*  its height, the storm lifted gables and roofs from buildings, flung rafters and entire advertising [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3769.9s)]

*  it like living torches. Behind collapsing facades, the flames shot up as high as houses, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3781.5s)]
*  rolled like a tidal wave through the streets at a speed of over 150 kilometers an hour, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3788.74s)]
*  spun across open squares in strange rhythms like rolling cylinders of fire. The water [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3794.3s)]
*  in some of the canals was ablaze. The glass in tram car windows melted. Stocks of sugar [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3800.74s)]
*  boiled in the bakery cellars. Those who had fled from their air raid shelters sank with [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3807.18s)]
*  grotesque contortions into the thick bubbles thrown up by the melting asphalt. No one [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3813.08s)]
*  knows for certain how many lost their lives that night, or how many went mad before they [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3819.5s)]
*  died. When day broke, the summer dawn could not penetrate the leaden gloom above the city. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3824.36s)]
*  The smoke had risen to a height of 8,000 meters where it spread like a vast anvil-shaped cumulonimbus [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3831.7599999999998s)]
*  cloud. A wavering heat, which the bomber pilots said they felt through the sides of [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3838.36s)]
*  their planes, continued to rise from the smoking, glowing mounds of stone. Residential districts [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3843.76s)]
*  so large that their total street length amounted to 200 kilometers were utterly destroyed. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3851.6400000000003s)]
*  Horribly disfigured corpses lay everywhere. Bluish little phosphorous flames still flickered [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3858.1400000000003s)]
*  around many of them. Others had been roasted brown or purple and reduced to a third of [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3863.98s)]
*  their normal size. They lay doubled up in pools of their own melted fat, which had sometimes [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3869.3s)]
*  already congealed. The central death zone was declared off limits in the next few days. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3875.78s)]
*  When punishment labor gangs and camp inmates could begin clearing it in August, after the [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3882.3s)]
*  rubble had cooled down, they found people still sitting at tables or up against walls [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3886.68s)]
*  where they had been overcome by monoxide gas. Elsewhere, clumps of flesh and bone or whole [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3892.18s)]
*  heaps of bodies had cooked in the water gushing from bursting boilers. Other victims had [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3898.46s)]
*  been so badly charred and reduced to ashes by the heat, which had risen to a thousand [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3904.7s)]
*  degrees or more, that the remains of families consisting of several people could be carried [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3909.3s)]
*  away in a single laundry basket. The exodus of survivors from Hamburg had begun on the [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3914.7400000000002s)]
*  night of the air raid itself. It started, as Nasak writes, with, quote, constant movement [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3921.3s)]
*  in all the neighboring streets, going no one knew where. The refugees, numbering one and [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3927.1800000000003s)]
*  a quarter million, dispersed all over the Reich, as far as its outer borders. Under [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3933.9s)]
*  his diary entry for August 20th, 1943, Friedrich Reck wrote, and now this is me talking, Friedrich [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3939.5s)]
*  Reck Malashevin, who we'll be hearing a lot from throughout this series, was a conservative [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3947.5s)]
*  German who was very critical of the Hitler regime and who actually would die in a concentration [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3953.1s)]
*  camp after refusing to keep his mouth shut. Sebald pulls a few quotes here from Reck's [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3957.9s)]
*  diary, but I have the diary here and I'm going to quote the passage more fully. So now this [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3964.1s)]
*  is Friedrich Reck. Quote, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3969.66s)]
*  The news from Hamburg is simply beyond the grasp of the imagination. Streets of boiling [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3973.62s)]
*  asphalt into which the victims sank and were boiled alive. Veritable cities of ruins, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3979.22s)]
*  which cover the dead and surround those still alive like some jagged stone martyr's crown. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3985.02s)]
*  The talk is of two hundred thousand dead. I am not one who believes everything he is [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3991.18s)]
*  told. I much prefer seeing the thing for myself. And I think that in this case what [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=3997.1s)]
*  I have seen with my own eyes suffices. I've heard a great deal about the completely wild [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4002.58s)]
*  and disoriented behavior of people in Hamburg as the city burned. Stories of amnesia, stories [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4008.2599999999998s)]
*  of people wandering through the streets in the pajamas they had on when they fled from [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4014.4s)]
*  their houses, crazy-eyed, carrying an empty bird cage, with no memory of a yesterday and [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4018.2599999999998s)]
*  no idea of a tomorrow. And now this is what I saw on a burning hot day in early August [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4025.06s)]
*  at a little railroad station in upper Bavaria where forty or fifty of these miserable people [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4032.14s)]
*  were milling about, scrambling, despite the angry roars of the station master, into a [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4036.9s)]
*  car through a window they had broken, pushing, kicking, yelling, accustomed by now to fighting [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4042.5s)]
*  for space. What happened then was inevitable. A suitcase, a miserable lump of cardboard [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4049.38s)]
*  with edges broken off, missed the target, fell back onto the platform and broke open, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4055.78s)]
*  revealing its contents. There was a pile of clothes, a manicure kit, a toy, and there [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4061.1s)]
*  was the baked corpse of a child, shrunk to the proportions of a mummy, which the half-crazed [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4069.1s)]
*  woman had dragged along with her, the macabre remains of what only a few days before had [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4074.38s)]
*  been a family. Cries of dismay, disgust, roars, historical outbursts, the snarls of [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4079.7000000000003s)]
*  a small dog, until finally an official took pity on all of them and had the thing disposed [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4086.7000000000003s)]
*  of. Another report I heard was that the firestorm created by the immense conflagration sucked [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4091.94s)]
*  up into it all the oxygen, suffocating people who were far away from the actual flames, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4098.66s)]
*  and that the rain of phosphorus broiled the corpses of grown men and women into tiny, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4104.2s)]
*  child-sized mummies, so that countless women are now wandering about the country, their [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4109.12s)]
*  homes in ruins, carrying with them these ghastly relics." These raids were referred to by the [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4113.96s)]
*  people planning and carrying them out as morale bombing. Others called them terror bombing. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4124.5599999999995s)]
*  They had no direct military purpose. All the men of fighting age were at the front, and [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4133.78s)]
*  the bombing runs were so indiscriminate that we cannot take seriously the old post-hoc [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4140.16s)]
*  justification of reducing the industrial capacity of Germany's military machine. When one city [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4144.86s)]
*  was destroyed, the homeless survivors would pack into the next city until it too was burned [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4152.74s)]
*  up. We chased these refugees from city to city with our bombers until every single German [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4159.24s)]
*  city with the pre-war population of 50,000 people or more, and countless smaller towns [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4164.8s)]
*  and villages, were completely annihilated, until the campaign climaxed and the total [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4170.719999999999s)]
*  destruction of the ancient city of Dresden. Hundreds of thousands of women, children, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4176.58s)]
*  and elderly refugees had packed into Dresden like sardines, hoping that even after everything [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4183.16s)]
*  that had happened, maybe the Allies would stop short of attacking a city that obviously [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4189.84s)]
*  had no military value, and which was not only a German but a European cultural heritage [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4195.78s)]
*  site. But Dresden was utterly destroyed in February 1945, just two months before the [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4201.68s)]
*  end of the war, with German forces in full collapse and Allied forces already racing [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4210.24s)]
*  across German territory toward Berlin from both East and West. After American forces [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4215.400000000001s)]
*  liberated the Dachau concentration camp, just one week before Germany's unconditional surrender, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4223.68s)]
*  our soldiers rampaged through the camp, murdering dozens of surrendered German soldiers. For [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4230.360000000001s)]
*  several days, the camp's former inmates were given free rein to torture, humiliate, and [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4236.64s)]
*  murder the Germans that they could lay their hands on, often with the participation and [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4243.160000000001s)]
*  assistance of the Americans. An American soldier named Jack Hallett remembered, quote, The [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4247.52s)]
*  men were deliberately wounding the guards that were available and then turned them over [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4255.240000000001s)]
*  to the prisoners and allowing them to take their revenge on them. And in fact, you've [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4259.400000000001s)]
*  seen the picture where one of the soldiers gave one of the inmates a bayonet and watched [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4263.88s)]
*  him behead the man. It was a pretty gory mess. A lot of the guards were shot in the legs [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4268.32s)]
*  so they couldn't move. And and that's about all I can say. End quote. Not only soldiers [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4274.16s)]
*  and guards, but mechanics, secretaries, supply personnel and others like that were shot in [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4283.2s)]
*  the legs by American soldiers who watched as former inmates beat, tortured, hanged and [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4290.56s)]
*  burned them alive. Millions upon millions of Germans, many of them civilians and many [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4297.6s)]
*  of those not even Germans from Germany, but who were just ethnic Germans who had happened [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4305.360000000001s)]
*  to live in surrounding countries, were enslaved by the allied countries long after the war [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4310.84s)]
*  and forced not only to perform cleanup and military support labor, but to handle corpses [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4317.28s)]
*  without sanitation equipment and to clear minefields without safety gear, which was [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4322.48s)]
*  tantamount to an execution without trial. In Britain and France, the governments claimed [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4327.48s)]
*  ownership of their German slaves. Ownership was the word they used and made billions of [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4335.36s)]
*  dollars renting out their labor to private companies. Conditions in POW camps run by [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4341.84s)]
*  the Western allies were so abominable that Germans were dropping like flies from typhus, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4349.28s)]
*  dysentery and starvation. Tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands of Germans died in British, French [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4354.88s)]
*  and American captivity within a year of the end of the war. In many prison camps, Germans [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4363.12s)]
*  were forced to go days without water. One man, a mechanic, remembered his time in an American camp, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4370.32s)]
*  We would drink our own urine. It tasted terrible, but what could we do? Some men got down on the [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4378.4s)]
*  ground and licked the ground to get some moisture. I was so weak that I was already on my knees [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4384.5599999999995s)]
*  when we finally got a little water to drink. I think I would have died without the water, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4390.32s)]
*  but the Rhine River was just outside the wire. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4395.280000000001s)]
*  When an American camp commandant was asked why the prisoners were being made to suffer such [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4400.72s)]
*  inhumane conditions, he did not claim helplessness, but admitted that it was to break their spirits, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4405.04s)]
*  or in his words, so that they would lose their joy of soldiering once and for all. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4412.64s)]
*  In the formerly occupied countries, local civilians, with a more or less explicit blessing [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4417.52s)]
*  from the allied authorities, launched a continent-wide pogrom against ethnic Germans. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4422.320000000001s)]
*  Fifteen million people, whose families had been living in other countries for hundreds of years, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4428.96s)]
*  had their property seized and were forced marched to one of the German occupation zones with nothing [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4434.400000000001s)]
*  but the clothes they wore. Many were beaten, raped, and killed. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4439.4400000000005s)]
*  The Germans were raped and murdered on their way out, and some two million [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4447.52s)]
*  ethnic Germans were killed in a very short period of time. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4451.76s)]
*  Edvard Benes, the exiled president of Czechoslovakia, returned to Prague in May 1945, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4457.360000000001s)]
*  and in his first speech told the Czech people that not only Nazis, not only citizens of the Reich, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4463.6s)]
*  but all people of German descent were responsible for the actions of the Hitler government, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4469.76s)]
*  the limitless contempt of all mankind. Benes' Minister of Justice Prokop Dutina [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4475.6s)]
*  said that the Germans in their midst were a foreign ulcer in our body, and that there are no good [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4483.68s)]
*  Germans, only bad and even worse ones. Similar sentiments were echoed by officials up and down [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4490.4800000000005s)]
*  the Czech government. Benes ordered the expropriation and expulsion of nearly three million people, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4498.08s)]
*  and effectively declared open season on ethnic Germans. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4505.52s)]
*  Men were beaten, tortured, and often killed. Women and sometimes children were raped. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4509.92s)]
*  An engineer named Kurt Schmidt remembered, quote, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4517.6s)]
*  If any man had tried to protect his wife, he would have risked being killed. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4521.84s)]
*  The Russians and the Czechs as well did not even trouble to take the women away. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4526.08s)]

*  During the nights one could hear the moaning and whimpering of these poor women. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4537.28s)]
*  Day and night there was no peace for our nerves, and it was as if we had entered hell. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4541.76s)]
*  A German woman from another Czech prison camp recalled that, quote, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4549.52s)]
*  The mob in the streets behaved even worse than the guards. Especially the older women [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4554.08s)]
*  excelled themselves and had armed themselves for this purpose with iron rods, truncheons, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4558.88s)]
*  dog leashes, etc. Some of us were beaten so badly that they collapsed and were unable to get up again. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4563.76s)]
*  The mob broke through and we were again exposed to their maltreatment without any protection. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4570.64s)]
*  Some of my fellow sufferers jumped into the moldow in their desperation where they were [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4576.24s)]
*  immediately fired at. One of the Czechs had a large pair of scissors, and one after another of [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4580.32s)]
*  us had her hair cut off. Another Czech poured red paint over our heads. I myself had four teeth [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4586.08s)]
*  knocked out. Rings were torn by force from our swollen fingers. Others were interested in our [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4592.72s)]
*  shoes and clothes so that we ended up by being almost naked. Even pieces of underwear had been [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4598.96s)]
*  torn from our bodies. Young lads and men kicked us in the abdomen. In complete desperation I also [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4604.16s)]
*  tried to jump into the river, but I was snatched back and received another beating. End quote. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4611.52s)]

*  The situation for Germans in Prague is broadly representative of the rest of the country. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4628.72s)]

*  They pulled the people off the train and shot 71 men, 120 women, and 74 children, and dumped the [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4661.44s)]
*  bodies into a mass grave. The unit's commander justified killing the children by saying, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4669.84s)]
*  What was I supposed to do with them after we'd shot their parents? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4676.08s)]
*  Of course, every terrible thing that happened in the western occupation zones were reflected [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4682.400000000001s)]

*  without hearing of brutalities committed by Russian soldiers. Hungarian girls were locked [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4717.04s)]

*  killed. Even the Swedish legation was attacked by rampaging Red Army soldiers who stole possessions [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4727.84s)]
*  and raped women regardless of their nationality. The serious problem of rape by Soviet soldiers in [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4734.32s)]
*  Eastern Europe turned out to be a pale foreshadowing of what was to face the German population when [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4740.88s)]
*  Soviet armies initially marched into German territory. Reading the Soviet hate propaganda [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4746.96s)]
*  could lead one to believe that it was as important for the Soviets to humiliate the German population [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4753.04s)]
*  as it was to defeat the German army. Front newspapers encouraged soldiers to recite the harm [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4758.8s)]
*  done to themselves and their families and to keep a book of revenge that would remind them of the [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4765.2s)]
*  need to repay the Germans for their evil. Ilya Ehrenberg's chants of ritual hatred for the [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4770.4800000000005s)]
*  Germans were so often printed and repeated that they became national slogans. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4776.8s)]
*  We shall not speak anymore. We shall not get excited. We shall kill. If you have not killed [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4782.16s)]
*  at least one German a day, you have wasted that day. If you kill one German, kill another. There [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4788.56s)]

*  their nooses. Burn their homes to the ground and enjoy the flames. These were the messages that [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4803.04s)]
*  permeated the last years of the war. Marshal Zhukov's orders to the 1st Belorussian Front [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4809.84s)]
*  on the eve of the January 1945 offensive into Poland did little to dampen the Soviet soldiers' [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4815.68s)]
*  lust for revenge. Woe to the land of the murderers, the orders stated. We will get our terrible revenge [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4822.08s)]
*  for everything. A veteran of the East Prussian campaign described the national hatred that fed [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4829.12s)]
*  the Soviet march. As the front drew closer to the borders of Germany, the propaganda of hate not [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4835.84s)]
*  only of the German army, not only of the German people, but even of the German land itself took [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4842.32s)]
*  on a more and more monstrous character. The final directive from the main political administration [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4848.16s)]
*  of the army on the eve of crossing the borders of East Prussia said that, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4854.72s)]
*  It was not untypical for Soviet troops to rape every female over the age of 12 or 13 in a village, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4875.04s)]
*  killing many in the process, to pillage the homes for food, alcohol, and loot, and to leave the [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4881.76s)]
*  villages in flames. The reports of women subjected to gang rapes and ghastly nightly rapes are far [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4888.320000000001s)]
*  too numerous to be considered isolated incidents. Lev Kopolev, then a captain in the Soviet army, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4895.360000000001s)]

*  Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who was also an officer in East Prussia, provides a fitting testimonial to [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4908.08s)]
*  what he witnessed in that region in his poem Prussian Nights. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4914.08s)]
*  Platoon? A company perhaps? A girl's been turned into a woman. A woman turned into a corpse. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4938.08s)]
*  Continued rape and plunder drove the Germans to desperate actions. As a state security officer [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4947.44s)]
*  in East Prussia coolly reported back to Moscow, the suicides of Germans, especially women, have [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4953.36s)]
*  become more and more common. Even after German troops were thoroughly defeated and East Prussia [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4959.36s)]
*  was under occupation, the threat of rape continued to plague German women. Hermann Matskovsky, a [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4965.28s)]
*  veteran German communist and newly appointed local mayor of the district of Königsberg, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4972.08s)]
*  reported that one of the only sources of food in town after its fall in early April 1945 was [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4977.12s)]
*  horse meat from the veterinary hospital on the outskirts of the city. Of those women who went to [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4983.5199999999995s)]
*  fetch the meat, barely one half returned unscathed. Many were raped. Some did not return home at all. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4988.88s)]
*  The only Germans in Königsberg who were well fed, Mayor Matskovsky continued, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=4997.4400000000005s)]
*  are women who have become pregnant by Russian soldiers. Six months after the end of the war, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5001.92s)]
*  on November 6th and 7th, 1945, Red Army Day, the mayor wrote, Russian soldiers actually [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5007.76s)]
*  seemed to have permission for every kind of transgression against the Germans. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5014.56s)]
*  Men were beaten. Most women were raped, including my 71-year-old mother who died by Christmas. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5019.200000000001s)]
*  The dreadful disorder resulting from the East Prussian campaign did not make enough of an [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5027.280000000001s)]
*  impact on the Red Army hierarchy to institute the kinds of punishment that might have prevented [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5031.68s)]
*  further rape as Soviet armies pushed beyond the Vistula into Silesia and Pomerania, what was to [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5036.400000000001s)]
*  become Western Poland. Once again, the road signs urged Soviet soldiers to hurt the German people. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5042.24s)]
*  Soldier, you are in Germany. Take revenge. The German social democrat August Sander collected [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5049.679999999999s)]
*  eyewitness accounts of the Soviet takeover of this region that document the fate of countless [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5057.76s)]
*  German women. Soviet soldiers again took out their revenge on helpless women and girls, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5062.5599999999995s)]
*  often as in East Prussia while under the influence of alcohol. One German village [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5068.16s)]
*  captured on February 26th, 1945, was systematically plundered and virtually all of the women were [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5073.599999999999s)]
*  raped. The screams of help from the tortured could be heard day and night." [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5080.0s)]
*  The epidemic of rape continued long after the war was over. American military intelligence [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5088.72s)]
*  obtained and translated many reports from the Soviet occupation zone. A sampling of [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5095.12s)]
*  reports over a period of just a few weeks from one German refugee camp reads like an outrageous drum [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5100.5599999999995s)]

*  14 June, 46 rapes, one woman five times within two hours. 15 June, 46 rapes up to 80 years old, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5129.68s)]
*  escape of women who jumped out of windows, breaking feet and legs, raping in presence of husbands, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5139.84s)]
*  looting, mistreatments, shooting, more looting, more rapes, women whipped in spite of being sick. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5146.320000000001s)]

*  age 16 years, mother presumably shot, end quote. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5171.04s)]

*  You probably have two voices battling for space in your head right now. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5204.0s)]
*  One of them says that raping over two million women and incinerating whole cities full of [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5209.68s)]
*  refugees and executing children en masse is bad. But the other voice says, well yes, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5216.72s)]

*  justification for the often brutally violent defense of that order and its supporting values. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5342.16s)]
*  In other words, when someone does World War II history, they're not doing normal history. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5348.24s)]
*  How could it possibly be normal history when the war is over? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5355.04s)]
*  How could it possibly be normal history when you can be charged with a crime for challenging the [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5358.639999999999s)]
*  official narrative? They're taking hold of the most important load-bearing myth of our civilization, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5362.5599999999995s)]
*  and people learn to tread carefully around myths like that. In this series, out of respect for the [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5370.5599999999995s)]
*  dead and for those who suffered, I will try to be careful, but I will be honest, and I will treat [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5377.84s)]
*  the Germans like human beings, not like demons who are beyond the pale of our understanding. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5385.2s)]
*  Most importantly, I want to understand how the war looked from the other side. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5389.360000000001s)]
*  It's inconceivable to anybody raised on the court history of the Second World War that the Germans [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5393.360000000001s)]
*  could have sincerely believed that they were the ones under attack, that the war had been forced [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5398.0s)]
*  on them against their own will, and that the war was not going to be over. I will be honest, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5403.6s)]
*  but I will be honest, that the war had been forced on them against their own will, and that [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5411.12s)]
*  the crimes they committed were only fair given the savagery of the enemy they were facing. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5415.76s)]
*  In other words, that the Germans saw themselves in the same position in which the Allied countries [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5421.36s)]
*  have always seen themselves. It is inconceivable, but it is true. From Hitler down to ordinary [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5426.32s)]
*  Germans, whether supporters, neutrals, or critics of the Hitler regime, most Germans sincerely [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5436.4s)]
*  believed that an existential war had been forced on them by an implacable and overwhelmingly powerful [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5444.08s)]
*  enemy. We need to understand how that's possible if we have any hope of understanding why the war [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5450.719999999999s)]
*  happened and what it was like to be on the losing end of it. This is not something that's only [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5459.04s)]
*  relevant to historical debates. It's long been observed that Americans, the American people, I [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5465.92s)]
*  mean, cannot really be riled up to go to war unless we believe it's a religious crusade, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5472.64s)]
*  against fascism, against communism, against terrorism. How many of our modern enemies, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5478.8s)]
*  from Osama bin Laden to Vladimir Putin, from the Israelis to the Palestinians, depending on what [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5485.68s)]
*  side of that question you take, how often have we been told that they have no case to make, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5491.36s)]
*  they have no rational demands, they have no reasonable fears or concerns. They are just [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5498.16s)]
*  bloodthirsty barbarians who hate us for our freedom and only understand the language of violence. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5504.96s)]
*  To ask what we might have done differently to avoid or de-escalate the conflict is tantamount [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5512.24s)]
*  to treason. It makes you a Saddam apologist, a Gaddafi sympathizer, an Assadist, a supporter [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5517.6s)]
*  of Hamas terrorism or Israeli apartheid, a Putin stooge. To suggest that they might have any [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5525.52s)]
*  legitimate interests or concerns worthy of our respect or that we might have done things that, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5533.360000000001s)]
*  from their perspective, back them into a corner is just a parrot enemy propaganda. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5540.72s)]
*  The fact that such offensive arguments are taken seriously by otherwise sober and well-meaning [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5547.84s)]
*  people is one of the consequences of the Second World War. In his great series about the Mongol [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5553.52s)]
*  invasions, Dan Carlin asked us to imagine a future in which people spoke about Hitler and the Third [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5561.84s)]
*  Reich with the same detached objectivity that we now speak about Genghis Khan and his hordes. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5568.400000000001s)]
*  Dan's series about Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars, in which Caesar's forces killed and enslaved [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5574.72s)]
*  millions of Gauls and all but wiped out that ancient people, was called the Celtic Holocaust. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5581.280000000001s)]
*  We're not accustomed to thinking of Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, or Alexander of Macedon in the same [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5589.12s)]
*  way we think of Adolf Hitler, nor of the people who followed those other tyrants the same way [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5595.2s)]
*  we think of Germans in the 30s and 40s. In previous Martyr Made series, I've asked you to try to see [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5601.44s)]
*  yourself in the shoes of Zionist terrorists and Palestinian militants. I have tried to humanize [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5606.56s)]
*  the men who perpetrated the Meli massacre. I've done the same with Jim Jones in the cultists who [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5613.44s)]
*  committed mass suicide with him at Jonestown. All that feels like a warm-up for this series. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5619.92s)]
*  And there will be those of you who followed me into the dark depths to try to comprehend those [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5626.56s)]
*  people I just mentioned who will find this one to be a step too far. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5632.72s)]
*  Hitler has taken the place of the devil in our modern secular world. His followers are his legion [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5639.200000000001s)]
*  of demons. Auschwitz is his kingdom in hell. A devil is the sword of the devil. He's the [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5645.68s)]
*  cause of all evil in the world. The deepest moral abyss beneath which it is impossible to descend. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5653.52s)]
*  But we live in a world today where Satan has lost his menacing aspect [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5664.8s)]
*  and become something of a comic figure. Kids who want to shock their parents and rebel against the [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5669.28s)]
*  conventions of our society, they don't flash a pentagram. That's cringe. They read Mein Kampf [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5675.04s)]
*  and wear a swastika and say, Mom and Dad, what do you think of this? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5682.24s)]
*  And they do that because years of conditioning by the educational system [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5686.96s)]
*  and media propaganda and social pressure has taught them that it isn't the gospels anymore, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5691.04s)]
*  but the official narrative of the Second World War that is the real symbolic nerve center of our [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5696.24s)]
*  society. When I decided to take on this subject, many people who care about me lined up to express [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5701.92s)]
*  their concern, many of them to try to dissuade me and failing that to ask me, please, please, [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5711.12s)]
*  please be careful. And I told them what I tell everyone. My audience trusts me to be honest with [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5719.2s)]
*  them. And even when they disagree or get uncomfortable, they will give me the benefit of the doubt that I [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5727.12s)]
*  am coming from a place of empathy and a desire to genuinely understand people at the extremes of [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5733.04s)]
*  human experience. And I do not intend to abuse that trust. We're going to do this together. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5739.28s)]
*  So buckle up, because no matter how many books have been written or documentaries made or [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5747.92s)]
*  discussions had about the Second World War, I promise you, you've never heard a story like this. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qViXO_g1Vtg&t=5754.719999999999s)]
