*  Here we go. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=51.04s)]
*  I'm content to die for my beliefs. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=54.68s)]
*  So cut off my head and make me a martyr. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  The people will always remember it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=65.36s)]
*  No. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=69.56s)]
*  They will forget. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=71.48s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=74.2s)]
*  God is a thought. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=76.4s)]
*  God is an idea. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=77.92s)]
*  It is a place. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=81.2s)]
*  It is somewhere. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=82.36s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=85.4s)]
*  But it's reference is to something that transcends all things. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=88.52s)]
*  Why we must tear ourselves apart for this small question of religion. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  As we move into this next stage of the story, there's an aspect of the Cold War [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=107.56s)]
*  or of the 20th century struggle with communism in general. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=113.28s)]
*  That I want to talk about that can be very difficult to relate to in the early 21st [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  century. It's difficult for me to relate to. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=121.56s)]
*  Take yourself back to 1914, the outset of the First World War. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=124.92s)]
*  There are no communist countries anywhere on the planet. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=130.68s)]
*  By the late 1940s, just a few decades, a blink of an eye. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=135.24s)]
*  Historically, all of Russia, China and half of Europe are communist. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=138.84s)]
*  Communists would soon be leading the anti-imperialist revolutions getting [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=143.92s)]
*  underway in the colonized world and Africa and Asia and other places. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=147.28s)]
*  Communist parties were making gains and even revolutions on multiple continents [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  and countries where merely associating with them could get you arrested. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=155.2s)]
*  And this happened in just a few decades through the efforts of what was, without [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=161.64s)]
*  exception, in every country where they operated, just a committed minority, a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=166.83999999999997s)]
*  small group of people. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=172.24s)]
*  And despite extremely powerful propaganda, police and even military resistance by [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=175.24s)]
*  the non-communist world. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=180.56s)]
*  This did not just happen by accident. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=184.6s)]
*  The communists on the ground from London to Hanoi were unbelievably dedicated and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=187.72s)]
*  effective people. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  They were driven by zeal that only comes from believing, really believing that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=195.28s)]
*  they were the vanguard engaged in a historic project that was going to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=200.4s)]
*  transform the world for the better. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=203.68s)]
*  This is a thing that we can struggle with a bit today because we don't have a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  whole lot to compare it to in the contemporary world. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=211.72s)]
*  We have individuals who are dynamic and dedicated, no doubt, organizations even [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=214.0s)]
*  that are, but nothing to compare to the worldwide communist movement in the first [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=218.96s)]
*  half of the 20th century. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=224.96s)]
*  Maybe the closest thing is the global Islamist movement, but these are obviously [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  very different in substance and well, I mean, a major difference, I think, in how [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=231.56s)]
*  they develop is there's sort of a self-defeating mechanism built into the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  jihad movement, whereas the communists tend to develop and nurture their recruits. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=242.84s)]
*  Islamism often uses them up. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=247.24s)]
*  Today, if someone calls themselves a communist, it's kind of viewed as a fact. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  It's kind of viewed as a fashion statement or something, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=255.12s)]
*  Like even if people hit the streets and their black mass to protest the world [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=257.8s)]
*  trade organization or go fight the fascist, we sort of look at that as a [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=261.6s)]
*  lifestyle choice, you know, it's like being into extreme sports or something like that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=265.92s)]
*  It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a mass you can put on and take off back in the early [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=272.76s)]
*  to mid 20th century, we're that's not how it was. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=277.32s)]
*  We're talking about very serious people who really believed that they were [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=280.52s)]
*  engaged in a project that was going to overturn the global order that was going [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  to overturn the global order and result in revolutions around the world. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  The only thing that eventually slowed these people down and defeated communism [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=296.44s)]
*  with the fact that it's believers finally lost their faith. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  There's a great little book. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=304.56s)]
*  It doesn't get read enough anymore. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=306.2s)]
*  Very rarely read, but I push it on people whenever I can. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=308.56s)]
*  Great little book written in the early 1960s by a former British [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=311.68s)]
*  communist named Douglas Hyde. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=314.72s)]
*  It's called dedication and leadership. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=316.76s)]
*  Hyde had been a mentor and leader in the British communist party for a couple [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=319.6s)]
*  decades until in 1948, he left the party and converted to Catholicism. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=324.48s)]
*  So decade and a half later in the early sixties, he's giving a series of talks [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=329.92s)]
*  to groups of Catholic leaders. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=334.08s)]
*  In this book was a result and in it, he tries to clear up for his Catholic [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=335.36s)]
*  audience, some misconceptions, common misconceptions that they'd had about the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=340.48s)]
*  human material that the communists were working with, as well as about the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=345.48s)]
*  methods employed by the communists for, for developing that human material, for [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=349.08s)]
*  developing recruits into dedicated, effective workers for the revolution. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=353.0s)]
*  The very first thing he points out is that the communist understood and not [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=359.2s)]
*  just intuitively, they understood it as a matter of doctrine, as a matter of [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=365.2s)]
*  policy, that you tend to get what you ask for from people. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=368.44s)]
*  You know, that is if you ask for a small effort, you'll get a small effort. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=375.08s)]
*  But if you demand a major effort and major sacrifices, very often the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=380.32s)]
*  response you get from people is heroic. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=386.32s)]
*  This is especially true of young people who, you know, they haven't yet given up [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=389.68s)]
*  on idealism, out of despair at ever finding a suitable outlet for it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=393.64s)]
*  As a party leader, Douglas Hyde had traveled around the world with, you know, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=399.28s)]
*  with the party, working with local revolutionaries. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=404.88s)]
*  He had spent time in jail on several continents. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=407.44s)]
*  I mean, he was in the thick of it and he shares several anecdotes like [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=409.84s)]
*  this one to convey his point. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=412.88s)]
*  Quote, on the other side of the world in Kuching, Sarawak, Borneo, recently a [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=415.44s)]
*  security chief mentioned to me almost with awe the case of a young man who had [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=421.44s)]
*  gone to join the underground communist organization. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=425.84s)]
*  He came from a well-to-do Chinese family. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=429.36s)]
*  His father had no idea that he was in any way associated with the communists [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=432.48s)]
*  until one day he disappeared. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=436.12s)]
*  In due course, the father learned that his son had gone to work as a rubber [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=438.76s)]
*  tapper for a few cents a day in a mixed area. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=441.92s)]
*  That is to say, it was an area in which poor rural Chinese and dyaks lived in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=445.24s)]
*  close proximity to each other, even though they hardly ever mixed. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  Above all else, Sarawak's communist organization, which is exclusively Chinese, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=453.68s)]
*  wants to gain a following among the indigenous people. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=459.0s)]
*  And so its leaders had called for volunteers to go and live among the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=462.16s)]
*  dyaks in their longhouses. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=465.32s)]
*  The Chinese find the dyaks food unpalatable and practically uneatable. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  The lack of sanitation and regard for personal hygiene appalls the Chinese. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=472.6s)]
*  Most of the volunteers soon go down sick, but there are always others who step [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=477.32000000000005s)]
*  forward to take their place, just as this boy had done. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  Unquote. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=485.36s)]
*  Now, some people might hear that and say, okay, what's the big deal? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=488.12s)]
*  You know, it's like the boy joined the peace corps. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=491.32000000000005s)]
*  Except that this is a version of the peace corps where you would be hated by [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=494.16s)]
*  most of society and your family for joining. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=498.72s)]
*  And if you're caught, you'll be jailed and very possibly killed in a horrible way. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=502.56s)]
*  And this kind of dedication was not uncommon in communist movements. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=509.32s)]
*  In fact, it was the norm. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=513.2s)]
*  Again, keep in mind, there were no communist countries in 1914, just a bunch [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=516.24s)]
*  of underground groups reading the same books in different languages. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=520.6s)]
*  And by the late 1940s, a good chunk of the world was under communist control. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=524.4s)]
*  It was mounting a serious challenge to the American-led NATO world order. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=528.56s)]
*  It didn't just happen. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=533.8s)]
*  People did that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=535.4s)]
*  You're sure Germany put Lenin and his boys on a train and sent them to Russia. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=538.36s)]
*  But when they got off that train, it was up to them. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=541.92s)]
*  I mean, can we even imagine the difficulty involved in being a Vietnamese [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=546.12s)]
*  communist, opposing the French and then the Americans? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=550.92s)]
*  Or just think, just think of how much easier it was for the Americans to [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  do that, how much easier it would have been for any of those people to just [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=558.28s)]
*  been a communist sympathizer, you know, doing enough to avoid being called [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=562.9599999999999s)]
*  a collaborator, but little enough to avoid becoming a target of the imperialist. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=566.92s)]
*  Hyde tells another story that was told to him by a Vietnamese Catholic. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=573.52s)]
*  He's a Catholic, this man is no friend of communists or communism. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=578.92s)]
*  Quote, I remember some years ago talking to a man from Indochina who had fought [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=582.8s)]
*  the great siege of Diem Bien Phu. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=587.84s)]
*  Diem Bien Phu was the final big battle that drove the French out of Vietnam. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  I met him in Hong Kong. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=596.24s)]
*  He was a Catholic from North Vietnam who had been conscripted into Ho Chi Minh's army. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=598.0400000000001s)]
*  Our Western press had been full of the glory of the French army, which had put up [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=602.88s)]
*  such tremendous resistance at what was to prove to be its last ditch stand against [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=606.1600000000001s)]
*  the communist-led assault. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=609.76s)]
*  The French held onto the fortress for weeks on end, enduring all the immense [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  suffering that a protracted siege entails. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=615.8s)]
*  We did not, however, hear much about the men and the experiences on the other side. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  How about the people who were fighting against the French? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=624.64s)]
*  Besieging a fortress is a difficult and bloody business too. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=627.52s)]
*  I asked my Catholic from North Vietnam, what sort of briefing did they give you [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=631.88s)]
*  before they sent you into action? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=636.12s)]
*  The briefing they were given was this. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  You will almost certainly die. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=643.0s)]
*  Already, to get within gun range, you have to clamber and slither over men's [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=646.04s)]
*  rotting bodies, the bodies of your own comrades. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=650.56s)]
*  The probability is that you will die, just as they have done. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=655.04s)]
*  If you do, you will not just be dying in the fight against French colonialism. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=659.64s)]
*  You will not just be dying for Vietnam. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  You will be dying for suffering, oppressed humanity all over the world. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=668.3599999999999s)]
*  Your death will help to make the world a better place. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=673.28s)]
*  Now that was the briefing atheist leaders gave to their followers before [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=679.28s)]
*  they went into action. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=682.8s)]
*  They were not afraid to call on them to die, and they did not hesitate to base [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=684.56s)]
*  this upon an appeal to the idealism which is deep in the heart of every man. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=687.92s)]
*  They demonstrated, as communists have so often done, that this is a powerful thing. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=692.8s)]
*  And their followers went into action, wave upon wave, ready to die so that [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=697.6s)]
*  others might live. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=701.76s)]
*  They were sent into battle, morally prepared to fight. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=703.72s)]
*  End quote. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=707.64s)]
*  Now, of course, in the West, communists in the West were not risking execution [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=710.4399999999999s)]
*  by death squad. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=715.56s)]
*  I don't want to overplay that, but I'm not going to underplay it either. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=716.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, it took real commitment to give your life to the cause at a time when [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=720.04s)]
*  expressing support for communism had something like the social consequences [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=725.72s)]
*  of expressing support for Al Qaeda today. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=730.2s)]
*  That's probably understating it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=733.6400000000001s)]
*  If you get fired from your job for saying nice things about Al Qaeda, you know, you [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=734.96s)]
*  probably have a strong discrimination lawsuit with pro bono representation from [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=738.9200000000001s)]
*  the ACLU. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=742.72s)]
*  You know, you're talking about the 1950s and McCarthy era in the midst of the Cold [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=745.5600000000001s)]
*  War. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=749.6800000000001s)]
*  It was, you know, these were committed individuals. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=750.0s)]
*  You had to be. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=753.88s)]
*  And they became more committed the more involved they became with the communist [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=755.48s)]
*  movement. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=758.88s)]
*  The movement gave meaning to people who very often hadn't experienced it deeply, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=761.2s)]
*  especially communally. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=765.1600000000001s)]
*  And it often had just spectacular results on individual personalities. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=767.32s)]
*  People blossomed in ways they never had in their life. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=771.9200000000001s)]
*  Their capabilities just hide tells about how workers who by any measure used by [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=775.32s)]
*  the rest of society were mediocre people or worse, and they would come looking to [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=782.48s)]
*  join the party. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=786.9200000000001s)]
*  Often they would be told this is how they would handle these kind of people. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=788.6s)]
*  They would be told, look, the first thing you can do for the party, if you want to [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=791.4s)]
*  help is to get better at your day job. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=795.64s)]
*  Just focus on that for the next six months as we begin to educate you in [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=799.28s)]
*  Marxist doctrine. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=803.76s)]
*  For now, your goal should simply be to be the best machinist at your factory, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=805.76s)]
*  someone the other workers respect and are glad to work with. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=811.24s)]
*  People have to know that communists are not just talkers, but that we're among [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=814.6s)]
*  the best workers that were worthy of their respect. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=818.2s)]
*  And because this potential recruit has been inspired by the environment that he [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=822.9200000000001s)]
*  sees in the party, by the ethic of sacrifice that he observes among the other [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=827.9200000000001s)]
*  members, and especially the leaders, he follows these instructions. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=832.24s)]
*  Some don't some drop off, but a lot of them follow those instructions. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=837.72s)]
*  Some months later, this mediocre specimen who his whole life has been a nobody and [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=840.9599999999999s)]
*  felt like a nobody, been seen as a nobody. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=847.28s)]
*  Some months later, this guy has become a pillar of his community, a leader at his [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=851.04s)]
*  factory, a person to whom others are looking for guidance. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=856.7199999999999s)]
*  His family sees the change in him and he develops a sense of self-respect that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=861.88s)]
*  he's lacked his whole life. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=866.4s)]
*  Hyde gives a bunch of examples of this, including many from his own experience. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=867.68s)]
*  In one case, a morbidly obese worker, mediocre worker with a debilitating stutter. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=872.1999999999999s)]
*  So you just have all the boxes checked there. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=878.68s)]
*  Comes to him. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=882.0s)]
*  He has a lot of energy and commitment, but you know, sky is not very promising. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=883.04s)]
*  It took time, but this pitiful creature, this shy, ungrateful, ungrateful, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=889.24s)]
*  shy, stuttering man eventually became an important leader in the movement, in the [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=897.08s)]
*  party. He became a respected leader of his trade union, an effective speaker who [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=903.48s)]
*  could move large crowds. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=907.96s)]
*  You know, this man whom Hyde said was, well, he said he was, quote, the most [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=910.5600000000001s)]
*  unpromising piece of human material that ever came my way, end quote. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=915.44s)]
*  He had become a leader of men. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=920.6800000000001s)]
*  When he died, this man who who would have been lucky to have had his wife and [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=922.2s)]
*  children there listening to his eulogy by his grave, when he died, thousands of his [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=927.4000000000001s)]
*  fellow workers in trade unions led a procession through the streets, accompanying [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=932.9200000000001s)]
*  his body to the crematorium and his passing received a front page treatment in [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=937.5600000000001s)]
*  the Daily Worker newspaper. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=941.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm not saying that communism is the only thing that can have this effect [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=945.1600000000001s)]
*  on people, of course. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=948.12s)]
*  Christianity once had this kind of power, still might here and there, I assume. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=949.0s)]
*  Islam certainly has the power to elicit the full devotion and dedication of at least [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=953.8s)]
*  some of its believers. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=958.12s)]
*  But mostly in the West today, we tend to view complete dedication to anything, no [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=961.72s)]
*  matter what it is, with suspicion. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=970.84s)]
*  Like it's a dangerous aberration with the potential to go off the rails in [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=973.4399999999999s)]
*  unpredictable and catastrophic ways. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=977.3599999999999s)]
*  And that's true. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=980.7199999999999s)]
*  You know, we were suspicious for a reason. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=982.16s)]
*  You've seen this movie before. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=984.64s)]
*  Yet, nevertheless, many of us and maybe all of us for moments or periods of our [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=988.24s)]
*  lives long to be shown something worth serving, something worth giving our lives [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=993.4399999999999s)]
*  to and for. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=999.04s)]
*  And for a great many people in the first half of the 20th century, they found that [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1003.04s)]
*  in communism and in the world that it promised. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1006.56s)]
*  And Jim Jones was one of those people. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1009.52s)]
*  We're going to discuss the early days of Jim Jones' ministry in this episode. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1014.0s)]
*  And we're going to see a guy who is driven like a bat out of hell to accomplish his [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1018.24s)]
*  goals. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1023.68s)]
*  I mean, with an almost inhuman energy and determination. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1024.48s)]
*  Biographies of Jones often point to his energy and dedication in these early days [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1029.68s)]
*  as signs of the mania that was eventually going to destroy him. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1034.4s)]

*  communist movement and the effect that it very commonly had on people. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1041.76s)]

*  We don't know exactly how Jim Jones was initiated and groomed as a communist in his [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1052.16s)]
*  early years. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1055.68s)]
*  We have his own words and a few clues, but it's hard to say exactly how his ideology [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1057.1200000000001s)]
*  developed early on. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1062.8000000000002s)]
*  In the biographies, there's a lot of speculation. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1065.44s)]
*  I'm not going to talk much about his childhood. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1068.88s)]
*  I don't put a lot of stock in the kind of, you know, there's a lot of post-hoc sort of [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1071.0400000000002s)]
*  reasoning when you read biographies of people who ended up, you know, going sort of off a cliff in [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1078.0s)]
*  one way or another. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1086.08s)]
*  After the Second World War is over, somebody who knew Hitler as a child said, you know, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1089.92s)]
*  somebody tripped him on the playground one day and he got up and said, one day you'll all pay [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1094.8s)]
*  for this. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1099.52s)]
*  And then I knew, you know, I don't put a lot of stock into that kind of thinking. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1099.92s)]
*  The permutations of Jim Jones ideology early on probably aren't very important anyway. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1103.52s)]
*  We know that he grew up as an outsider and that he identified with outsiders from a very early age. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1109.68s)]
*  We do know that. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1115.28s)]
*  In elementary school during the Second World War, we hear stories about how when all the other boys [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1116.8799999999999s)]
*  would play at being allied soldiers chasing Japanese and Germans around, Jim would usually [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1121.84s)]
*  play as the Soviet Union. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1126.96s)]
*  And sometimes he would play as the Nazis or the Japanese. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1128.8s)]
*  In middle school and high school, he was supposedly fascinated by Stalin, read books about him. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1131.44s)]
*  But by the time he was leaving high school in 1948, it's kind of hard to say where he was [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1137.2s)]
*  politically or how important politics in general were to him. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1143.6000000000001s)]
*  It was right at that time that he met his future wife, Marceline. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1150.08s)]
*  And, you know, she was from a conservative country, but she was a very conservative woman. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1154.32s)]
*  She was from a conservative Christian family at a time when [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1159.68s)]
*  communist and socialist talk was something that was not looked on very kindly. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1162.96s)]
*  And she wasn't frightened away by his ideological hang up. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1169.68s)]
*  So he made occasional noises in favor of socialism. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1172.24s)]
*  But at this point, right as he's getting out of high school, it seems to be kind of at a low ebb. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1176.88s)]
*  So Marceline met Jim in 1948 at Reed Memorial Hospital in Richmond, Indiana, where she was [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1182.88s)]
*  trained to be a nurse. And he was working as a part-time orderly. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1188.56s)]
*  Marceline was 20 and Jim was only 16. He was still only in his junior year of high school. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1193.12s)]
*  Marceline was a conscientious and strong-willed girl who took life very seriously at an early age. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1200.1599999999999s)]
*  She threw herself into whatever she took on. And when she was in high school, for example, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1208.0s)]
*  she started a small Christian youth choir to sing for hospital patients or at old folks homes, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1212.96s)]
*  things like that. And some of the other singers remember that when they would goof off, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1217.2s)]
*  I mean, they're high school kids at an unofficial, this isn't something being run by the school. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1221.8400000000001s)]
*  She started it herself. When they would goof off, she would scold them and lecture them [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1226.8s)]
*  about how their singing was the only music some of these people were probably going to hear. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1230.48s)]
*  So it was important that they take their practice very seriously as a Christian duty. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1234.16s)]
*  So this is the kind of person she was even in high school. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1238.24s)]
*  The hospital's nurse training program was full-time. Marceline and the other girls lived in a three-story [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1240.64s)]
*  brick dormitory, two to a room, and answered to a house mother who ensured that they were, you know, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1248.4s)]
*  adhering to academic routine and Christian morality. It was very conservative, sort of small town [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1254.0800000000002s)]
*  eastern Indiana. They went to chapel every morning. Attendance was mandatory. And the trainees were [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1259.8400000000001s)]
*  expected to be back in their dorms for lights out before 1030. In their own little ways, you know, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1267.36s)]
*  subdued and kind of naive ways, some of the girls would find their moments of rebellion by sneaking [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1273.28s)]
*  down to a midtown hotel for an evening cocktail, but Marceline was not one of those girls. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1277.4399999999998s)]
*  So in 1948, Marceline's nursing class is nearing graduation, and she and her roommate wanted to go [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1284.32s)]
*  somewhere far away on an adventure to help others and make their mark in the world. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1290.8s)]
*  Both of their families lived in Richmond, where they'd been going to nursing school, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1295.52s)]
*  and it expected the girls to transition to nursing jobs there at the hospital at Reed Memorial, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1299.36s)]
*  but with the world kind of opening up before them, they made the decision to go to Kentucky. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1304.32s)]
*  You know, it was 1948. A couple of young single Christian women leaving the state on their own [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1310.56s)]
*  to go make their way in the world was pretty ambitious. And so their plans were set, and [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1315.76s)]
*  Marceline, you know, she wasn't the type to change her mind once she made it, but then she met [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1322.24s)]
*  Jimmy Jones, and she wouldn't be the last person to change her life's plans after meeting him. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1327.4399999999998s)]
*  And so like I said, Jim was working part-time at the hospital. He was actually hitchhiking to [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1334.8s)]
*  Richmond after his high school classes ended up in Lynn, Indiana, a small town where he lived [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1339.36s)]
*  about a half hour to the north of the Ohio line. Jim Jones seemed older than he was, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1344.56s)]
*  older than he was to most people who knew him at the time, not only because he physically matured [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1351.0400000000002s)]
*  early, but because he had a confidence and overall seriousness, and just the way of carrying himself [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1355.3600000000001s)]
*  made him seem older. He was tall for his age, pretty well built, and he always had perfectly [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1361.5200000000002s)]
*  groomed jet black hair set over a face that betrayed a heritage foreign to the Anglo-German [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1368.24s)]
*  majority of his native Lynn. You know, in a land of blue-eyed blondes, Jim's features were almost [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1374.24s)]
*  Asiatic. He had dark almond-shaped eyes set into a high cheekbone face with a complexion that [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1381.6s)]
*  could have been made Native American, maybe could have been Mediterranean. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1388.48s)]
*  It's kind of a mystery where he got those features, to be honest. His mother and he [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1392.56s)]
*  would talk about Indian heritage, but I don't think anybody's ever actually been able to trace that [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1396.4s)]
*  out. When he smiled, you look back at these old high school pictures and stuff where when he smiles, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1400.08s)]
*  his mouth just stretches across his face from ear to ear, this great big smile. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1407.1999999999998s)]
*  And at the hospital, he had earned a reputation among the doctors and nurses as a hard worker, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1412.3999999999999s)]
*  and most importantly, he was loved, adored by the patients he cared for. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1418.3999999999999s)]
*  Jeff Gwynn in his biography of Jim Jones writes, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1423.6799999999998s)]
*  Patience from all over the region enjoyed the best of care at Reed. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1427.12s)]
*  Its staff was held to high standards. Reed paid well, but supervisors were sparing with praise [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1431.12s)]
*  and quick to weed out undesirables. 17-year-old Jimmy was hired as a night orderly, the lowest [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1436.96s)]
*  employment rung. It was hard work, often involving disagreeable tasks ranging from cleaning up vomit [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1443.28s)]
*  to helping move the newly deceased or handling disposal of amputated limbs. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1450.08s)]
*  Working through the night was hard enough, but for a boy trying to handle a full high school [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1454.64s)]
*  class schedule and homework, it was exceptionally onerous. Yet Jimmy thrived. He immediately [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1458.3200000000002s)]
*  demonstrated the ability to function on little sleep or, some days, none at all. As soon as his [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1464.48s)]
*  final afternoon class was over, Jimmy rushed through homework and reported for duty at Reed. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1470.0s)]
*  Once at work, he cheerfully tackled all the toughest chores that other orderlies tried to avoid. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1475.2800000000002s)]
*  Above all, these included dealing with cantankerous patients or else seriously ill [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1481.28s)]
*  unfortunates who literally reeked of decay and despair. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1484.96s)]
*  Jimmy Jones won them over with warm smiles, sweet natured jokes, and, always, empathy. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1489.04s)]
*  Patience of every background and their families felt this young man understood. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1495.9199999999998s)]
*  His memory was prodigious. Jimmy remembered every sick person's name and the names of parents and [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1501.76s)]
*  spouses and children and cousins besides. Some patients required care of especially personal [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1507.6s)]
*  nature, having diapers changed or being given sponge baths. Jimmy made these potentially [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1513.76s)]
*  embarrassing moments almost fun with his lively chatter and positive attitude. Reed management [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1519.04s)]
*  noticed. Orderlies routinely received critical performance reviews. There was nothing to [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1524.08s)]
*  criticize about Jimmy Jones. End quote. Many decades later, Jimmy was able to get [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1529.4399999999998s)]
*  many decades later after the death and destruction in Guyana, John Moore, a pastor who had lost two [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1536.64s)]
*  of his daughters to the mass suicide, so had no love for Jim Jones or any illusions about what he [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1543.28s)]
*  was. This is after the catastrophe has taken place. He nevertheless said that Jones was more sensitive [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1549.2s)]
*  to the suffering of others than any man he'd ever met. That was a sentiment repeated by many [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1556.16s)]
*  people over the years, by people who followed him, those who rejected him, and those who merely came [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1562.64s)]
*  into contact with him. By all accounts, it was not an act. But if it had been, it couldn't have been [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1569.92s)]
*  more perfectly tailored to get Marceline's attention. She'd first noticed him when he was [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1577.3600000000001s)]
*  assigned the difficult task of repairing a body of a pregnant woman who had died of trichinosis [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1583.68s)]
*  for the undertaker. Jim Jones was the orderly on call and she saw him visibly touched as he very [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1588.08s)]
*  gently and carefully handled the woman's body. Although he was only an orderly, he expressed [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1597.4399999999998s)]
*  concern for the woman's suffering family and even took time to go out and comfort them. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1604.8799999999999s)]
*  So after that, the two began chatting in the halls and on breaks, then sharing lunch in the [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1610.32s)]
*  cafeteria. And before long, Jim had just overwhelmed Marceline. She never met anyone like this. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1616.0s)]
*  It was 1948. The Cold War was just getting underway and Jim seemed to know about all of it. He knew [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1622.48s)]
*  about the war, about Hitler, Stalin, and Churchill. He knew their biographies. He would go on and on [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1628.32s)]
*  about how socialism and maybe even communism really weren't so bad, which kind of distressed [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1634.4s)]
*  her. But he knew how to manage it. Again, she's the Methodist daughter of a Republican city councilman. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1640.56s)]
*  So you can imagine her concern when she hears something like that. But then Jim would surprise [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1648.32s)]
*  her by supporting his claims with biblical passages. He'd quote Jesus about giving away [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1653.9199999999998s)]
*  all that one had to the poor and pointing out how the apostles were said to have pooled all their [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1659.12s)]
*  worldly possessions and given it out to each according to his need. He knew about some revolution [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1663.52s)]
*  going on in China and the efforts of an Indian saint to throw off British rule by means of non-violent [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1670.08s)]
*  resistance. She'd never heard anything like this from someone her own age. And in Jim, it didn't [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1674.8s)]
*  come across as just a recitation of facts to impress her. He was really possessed and shaped [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1680.8799999999999s)]
*  by the things that he spoke about, animated by them. It didn't matter what it was, not just politics. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1688.6399999999999s)]
*  It was his personality and his energy and enthusiasm pulled her in. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1694.72s)]
*  Whereas Marceline had been dreaming of a bold step over state lines to pursue her nursing career, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1700.48s)]
*  Jim's eyes were on the wider world. Things were changing, he said, and he intended to be more than [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1706.64s)]
*  just a mere spectator in the process of that change. Marceline was just swept away by all this. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1713.52s)]
*  She started to believe that maybe he could be somebody great. And if he was a little rough [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1719.28s)]
*  around the edges, you know, those edges could be smoothed out by the careful touch of a woman [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1723.92s)]
*  maybe like her. Marceline had always had a gentle heart and that Christian care for the unfortunate. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1728.72s)]
*  But before meeting Jim Jones, this was kind of an ethos that governed her approach to the people she [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1736.56s)]
*  met. It wasn't an ideology or a political program. You know, it had led her to become a nurse and to [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1741.2s)]
*  treat her patients with care. But Jim got her looking up from her daily work with the unfortunate [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1747.68s)]
*  to the broader reasons for their condition, as he described them. When he got wound up, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1752.88s)]
*  he would start ranting against the shortcomings in the American capitalist system and about [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1758.64s)]
*  inequality and the failure and even the complicity of the churches on this account. More than anything [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1763.04s)]
*  else, Jim talked about racism and the mistreatment of black Americans. In the age of social media, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1768.5600000000002s)]
*  today everyone's got an opinion on everything, but we got to remember this is a 16, 17-year-old kid [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1776.08s)]
*  in eastern Indiana in 1948 talking like this. By the end of that year, 1948, their relationship [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1781.04s)]
*  was at a crossroads. Marceline was graduating from nursing school and Jim, despite working nights at [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1790.0s)]
*  the hospital, was set to graduate with honors early from Richmond High and then move on to [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1796.64s)]
*  Indiana University at Bloomington, which is about two hours away if you take the route west to [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1801.76s)]
*  Indianapolis and then south from there. Marceline wasn't insensitive to the concerns of her family [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1806.0s)]
*  about Jim's age, but he very quickly even won them over. More privately, Marceline had worries about [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1812.96s)]
*  certain aspects of Jim's personality. While he was energetic and ambitious, qualities she admired in [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1821.68s)]
*  him, his rocket-fueled personality could be overbearing, a kick to ride along with, but [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1828.72s)]
*  riding along was all there was room for. Most of the time, Marceline was a willing rider, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1835.04s)]
*  but at the times when she tried to assert herself, Jim could be controlling and petulant [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1842.0s)]
*  if he didn't get his way. Marceline excused this as youthful immaturity that [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1847.04s)]
*  would even out with time. Marceline, according to people who knew her at the time and for years [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1855.36s)]
*  afterwards, always looked for and hoped for the best in people, excusing or overlooking their [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1860.6399999999999s)]
*  faults. Once she had decided that Jim's age was not a deal breaker, that allowed her to [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1866.6399999999999s)]
*  rationalize any troubling tendencies even more easily. In any case, nobody's perfect, certainly [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1871.28s)]
*  not anyone she was likely to find in her limited world. Jim shared her passion for helping the [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1878.24s)]
*  less fortunate and overall the good, especially the potential good in Jim greatly outweighed the bad. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1883.84s)]
*  And so for the first and most fateful time, Marceline would do what many, many others would [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1891.9199999999998s)]
*  do over the course of the next 30 years, closing their eyes to alarming things about Jim Jones, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1897.4399999999998s)]
*  instead choosing to focus on the good. She would do this herself over and over through the years and [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1904.48s)]
*  often be the deciding voice convincing other people to do the same thing. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1910.96s)]
*  Until finally 30 years to the month after Jim graduated from Richmond High and she made the [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1915.52s)]
*  decision to marry him, she would make her final failed stand as he ushered his followers to their deaths. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1922.32s)]
*  Now while Jim was away at college in Bloomington, his interest in social and racial justice led [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1930.96s)]
*  him to connect with the campus socialists. This was a period when socialists and communists were [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1936.88s)]
*  again very serious and disciplined people, they had to be. America during the cold war, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1942.88s)]
*  just before the McCarthy hysteria kicked off, was an unfriendly environment for socialists and [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1948.4s)]
*  communists to say the least. So they had to be serious, they had to be disciplined and it [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1953.8400000000001s)]
*  really tightened up their organizations and methods. Jim may have sought them out but it's [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1958.3200000000002s)]
*  more likely that they spotted this 17 year old kid asking questions in class that indicated he [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1963.76s)]
*  might be open to their views, maybe they felt them out before inviting them into their company. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1969.44s)]
*  You know again it's a political environment most of us are unfamiliar with today. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1975.2s)]
*  Jim very quickly got a lesson in how serious it was when he accepted an invitation to ride [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1980.48s)]
*  up to Chicago to see Paul Robeson speak, the black actor and communist activist. The event [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1985.2s)]
*  was under surveillance by the federal government and soon afterward Jim's mother was pulled aside [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1991.36s)]
*  in front of her co-workers at her factory job and questioned about her son's activities. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=1997.1999999999998s)]
*  She didn't know anything but rather than intimidating Jim the incident only began [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2002.56s)]
*  to radicalize him, push him closer to his new left-wing friends. Jim wasn't the type to back [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2008.32s)]
*  down from confrontation ever. In the summer of 1951 as headlines were announcing the racial [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2014.4s)]
*  violence and national guard deployment in Cicero Illinois that we talked about in the last episode [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2023.2s)]
*  the young Jones couple moved to Indianapolis. Jim had begun as a business major in Bloomington [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2028.88s)]
*  with an eye toward becoming a hospital administrator but his interest in politics [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2035.6000000000001s)]
*  and social justice led him to left-wing campus activism and eventually the hospital administrator [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2039.84s)]
*  thing kind of fell to the wayside. It had always been the whole idea of being a hospital administrator [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2045.6s)]
*  had always been a compromise between his political commitments and the need to think practically [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2052.3199999999997s)]
*  about a career but his contact with the campus socialists and developing events in the United [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2057.12s)]
*  States things like Cicero brought him back to focus on economic and racial justice. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2062.08s)]
*  And so Jim decided to go to law school and this meant transferring to the Indiana University campus [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2066.24s)]
*  in Indianapolis to get ready for it. The early years of their marriage together were difficult [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2070.56s)]
*  for Marceline and she occasionally thought about divorcing him. For all her ambition Marceline [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2078.0s)]
*  wanted a traditional family but there were two years in and Jim had shown zero interest in that. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2084.24s)]
*  His interest in politics was becoming an obsession and as he spent more time with his family he [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2089.9199999999996s)]
*  spent more time with his socialist friends and reading about events like Cicero Marceline felt [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2095.84s)]
*  like Jim was becoming radicalized, obsessed. In Indianapolis he began pushing right past the [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2100.08s)]
*  socialists and seeking out explicit communists. He began attending meetings and began preaching [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2107.04s)]
*  communism at home to Marceline and her nephew who had come to stay with the couple for a while. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2112.6400000000003s)]
*  Most alarming of all to Marceline Jim seemed not merely to have lost his religious faith but to [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2117.92s)]
*  embrace the communist outright hostility to Christianity. His espousal of communism at the [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2123.84s)]
*  height of the Korean War in the McCarthy area was worrying enough but his newfound aggressive [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2129.92s)]
*  atheism was devastating for Marceline. He couldn't even tolerate her faith as a difference of opinion. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2135.5200000000004s)]
*  He railed against her beliefs at home telling her that there was no god and that the bible was worse [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2142.6400000000003s)]
*  than a fraud. It was oppressive racist propaganda. The churches were organs of racism and class [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2147.6s)]
*  oppression. He became infuriated whenever she prayed even one time threatening to throw himself [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2153.68s)]
*  out of a window if she wouldn't stop both to put his death on her conscience and to prove to her [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2159.52s)]
*  that prayer was useless. He could get very petulant. Marceline had only seen flashes of this side of [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2164.08s)]
*  Jim while they were dating or else heard about it second hand. There was a time when Don Forman, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2171.52s)]
*  one of Jim's childhood friends, came to work at the Richmond hospital where Jim and Marceline had [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2176.96s)]
*  met. They were very good friends by some accounts best friends from elementary school and Jim and [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2180.88s)]
*  Don Forman had drifted apart as they got into high school as Don spent time on sports and you know [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2187.76s)]
*  backroads beer runs and Jim became kind of an increasingly isolated eccentric bookworm. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2192.4s)]
*  So in Richmond at the hospital Jim was away from everybody who knew him from Lynn his early years [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2199.6s)]
*  his hometown and so he was free to reinvent himself and start over. He often made up stories [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2206.08s)]
*  including one that particularly impressed Marceline about how he'd been a star high school [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2212.08s)]
*  basketball player but quit the team after the coach used a racial slur. Stories like that and his [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2216.48s)]
*  well stories like that and his natural charm made him popular at the hospital but now he had somebody [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2224.16s)]
*  who had known him his whole life who reminded Jim of the early growing pains and humiliations of [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2229.04s)]
*  adolescence and whose impression of him he couldn't control. Don barely lasted a few weeks [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2234.3199999999997s)]
*  of the job Jim made sure that he used the authority that he'd built up as a trusted orderly to terrorize [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2240.56s)]
*  him until he quit. One of the first times Marceline had brought Jim home for dinner to her family [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2245.4399999999996s)]
*  he revealed a very strong self-consciousness about their class difference. Jim had grown up very poor [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2253.9199999999996s)]
*  with a working mother and a prematurely aged father made invalid by a gas attack in World War [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2260.48s)]
*  I. Beginning in high school Jim began taking care to groom himself very well it's just he it was a [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2264.96s)]
*  switch he made for some reason. He would spend hours polishing his shoes and pressing his clothes [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2272.16s)]
*  making sure no hair on his head was ever out of place it became just everybody knew that's [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2277.92s)]
*  Jim Jones that's what he did. But he arrived for dinner that night with Marceline's family in his [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2283.12s)]
*  worst oldest clothes all disheveled and was just behaving like a brute just rudely throughout the [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2288.4s)]
*  entire meal. He assumed that they would be bourgeois snobs who were going to look down on him anyway [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2294.8s)]
*  and so he decided to preempt them. Another time Marceline's mother commented that she didn't think [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2300.1600000000003s)]
*  it was Christian for races to intermarry. You know it sounds it didn't sound as bad then as it does to [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2305.92s)]
*  us now obviously. But Jim he ordered Marceline to the car stormed out of the house shouting that [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2313.2s)]
*  neither he nor Marceline would be back. Marceline didn't see her parents for a long time after that [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2319.52s)]
*  and even then it was only after mother apologized and recanted. Marceline was often seen crying [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2323.8399999999997s)]
*  by her sisters and friends but she rarely complained. When she did it was indirect like [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2333.9199999999996s)]
*  when she warned her younger sister that when it was time for her to get married not to marry a [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2339.84s)]
*  domineering man. But Marceline you know she soldiered on and in any case the couple had [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2343.5200000000004s)]
*  other stressors. You know I don't want to give the impression that this was their entire life [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2351.84s)]
*  that it was just a complete mess from the first days. It wasn't it was like this sometimes and [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2355.76s)]
*  anyway the couple had other stressors taking up their mental space. Money was tight. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2361.6800000000003s)]
*  Jim was working several jobs at a time and Marceline worked as a school nurse in a hospital [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2366.0s)]
*  children's ward. They still had Marceline's 10 year old nephew to look after and juggled their [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2371.3599999999997s)]
*  schedules to make it work. And by all accounts all available accounts Jim and Marceline actually cared [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2376.96s)]
*  very deeply for the boy. His name was Ronnie although there are several anecdotes of Jim behaving [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2383.3599999999997s)]
*  immaturely toward the boy. I think a lot of the biographies tend to blow these incidents out of [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2388.88s)]
*  proportion as foreshadowing events to come. But I think they're more easily understood as mistakes [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2394.0s)]
*  you might expect when a 19 year old Jim is still only 19 years old here is suddenly trying to raise [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2401.6s)]
*  a boy only nine years younger than himself. You know for example Jim had a pet monkey that he [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2407.76s)]
*  would cause to chase Ronnie around the house and corner him and the boy apparently found that quite [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2414.4s)]
*  traumatizing which I can understand but I have trouble seeing that as a sign of evil unless we're [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2419.36s)]
*  willing to fix that label on most big brothers. Overall the couple did seem to do their best. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2425.36s)]
*  You know they had a very tight budget and schedule but they bought him a bike and lots of toys. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2432.32s)]
*  They took him on outings when they could. One of those outings was to Niagara Falls the source of [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2436.88s)]
*  another anecdote. They were upriver from the falls and Jim wanted Ronnie to let him [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2443.84s)]
*  Jim wanted Ronnie to let him dip Ronnie in the in the river you know kind of hold him and dip him [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2450.08s)]
*  in the river. Ronnie was terrified and he refused and Jim got annoyed and insisted and finally he [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2454.0s)]
*  just picked the boy up and held him so his legs were in the water. Again not cool but I think it [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2458.88s)]
*  gets blown out of proportion in some of the biography. It sounds to me like Jim was relating [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2468.0s)]
*  to the boy with the occasional light sadism of a big brother which is not really surprising. You [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2471.76s)]
*  know Jim was an only child so he didn't grow up with younger siblings and he was 19 and I don't [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2476.72s)]
*  think a lot of 19 year olds would know what to do if they suddenly had to take care of a 10 year [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2482.24s)]
*  old boy full-time. Anyway it was on there are going to be other things like this I think where [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2486.0s)]
*  people read back and you know I don't want to contradict necessarily authors who have put a [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2492.72s)]
*  lot of work and thought into it but I'll offer my thoughts on some of them when I think they're [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2498.8799999999997s)]
*  going a little too far. Anyway it was on that same trip to Niagara Falls that Jim Jones [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2502.64s)]
*  was pulled onto the path that would eventually lead him to his death in the jungle. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2509.68s)]
*  Marceline had never stopped praying and Jim's temper tantrums just caused her to pray more [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2515.04s)]
*  ardently for his soul. In early 1952 on the trip to Niagara Falls God had mercy and softened Jim's [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2519.84s)]
*  heart or something like that. She had managed to prevail upon him to come with her to a Methodist [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2526.96s)]
*  church service and at the church he saw posted a five-page document announcing the official [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2533.2s)]
*  Methodist positions and goals on a range of social issues. Among the church's priorities were [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2538.16s)]
*  supporting policies that would relieve poverty, favoring a stronger social welfare and social [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2544.32s)]
*  security system, support for collective bargaining, free speech, prison reform, the right to a job for [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2549.76s)]
*  all Americans and most importantly to Jim racial equality. Very soon after that day [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2556.0s)]
*  almost immediately to Marceline's amazement and utter delight Jim announced that he was going to [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2564.64s)]
*  become a preacher and so as Marceline spread the happy news and began to dream about being a [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2569.84s)]
*  preacher's wife something that everyone who knew her at the time thought was perfect for her, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2575.36s)]
*  Jim was considering the possibilities beginning to plot. He would later maintain that he had [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2580.24s)]
*  remained an atheist the whole way and that he was given the idea to use the church to bring people [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2587.7599999999998s)]
*  to communism. The left-wing activists were under constant active surveillance and persecution by [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2593.3599999999997s)]
*  Joe McCarthy and J. Edgar Hoover at this time but under the cover of religion he would have [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2600.3199999999997s)]
*  powerful protection under the first amendment. Communists had to use the tools at hand and to [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2605.28s)]
*  speak to people at their level. Midwestern white Christians were more likely to hear out one of [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2610.5600000000004s)]
*  their own speaking their own tongue than an atheist speaking in the indecipherable jargon of Marxist [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2616.0s)]
*  Leninism and didn't the Bible already provide the language to do most of his preparatory work for him? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2621.44s)]
*  Later in Jonestown Jim would even claim to have infiltrated the church in order to [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2627.76s)]
*  bring people to atheism. Soon after acquiring a congregation he would begin by pointing out [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2631.68s)]
*  inconsistencies in the Bible. He pointed out how segregated the churches were and he played up the [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2637.6s)]
*  role that they played in propping up racism, misogyny, and inequality. His attacks escalated [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2642.8799999999997s)]
*  until later after he'd moved his congregation to California. He had them cheering as he cursed the [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2649.52s)]
*  idea of a sky god and he stomped on the Bible and threw it across the room as his people shouted [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2656.3199999999997s)]
*  for joy. And by the time his people moved to Jonestown for their final acts well... [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2661.52s)]
*  Marxist Leninism is a worldview embracing the realm of traditional philosophy, human history, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2669.52s)]
*  political economy, and revolutionary change. And we must understand that in Jonestown [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2677.28s)]
*  the importance of developing this communist philosophy. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2684.4s)]
*  Today the new and rising phenomenon is in organizations of Marxist Leninist. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2690.7200000000003s)]
*  My name is John Harris and I'm a violent revolutionary and I kill three children. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2698.0800000000004s)]
*  Your name? Corrine Jackson. I would kill any government official that was standing [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2707.28s)]
*  in the way of our church progress. So that there can really be a strong communist movement [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2712.24s)]
*  and also there must be a strong socialist movement and a strong free trade union movement [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2719.12s)]
*  if fascism and genocide, the retro nuclear war, is there at all but any chance be hoped to be stopped [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2725.12s)]
*  and there's no chance, not hard, there's no false chance in hell particularly that nuclear war can [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2734.56s)]
*  be stopped. What would you do for this cause? Oh I would kill, murder, do anything you know. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2740.56s)]
*  Who? Well I'd kill Nixon and four and anybody else like him. All right. As developed by Marx, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2751.68s)]
*  Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and many others, Marxist Leninism has been a way of both understanding [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2757.92s)]
*  the world and changing it. We can say that only a Marxist Leninist party can produce the basic [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2765.76s)]
*  principles, long-term strategy, and political program which might deserve to be called scientific [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2774.1600000000003s)]
*  theory. We as you know have been praised in the Soviet Union and we're making overtrace to the [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2781.36s)]
*  Soviet Union. We're meeting in the Soviet Union tonight. We've told the Soviet Union in fact their [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2785.6800000000003s)]
*  wish, their slightest wish is our command. That meant anything, that whatever, if that would be [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2791.2s)]
*  that we would fight and so whatever the Soviet Union were to say tonight I would do. If they were [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2799.12s)]
*  to give an order that's what I'd do. I would do that. In the USA particularly, the spontaneous [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2805.4399999999996s)]
*  movements of struggle among the masses as well as the practical, even though limited initiatives [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2810.3999999999996s)]
*  that communist groups can undertake at this time likewise provide a school for the training [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2817.12s)]
*  and development of a communist cadre. But all that still a ways off. Back here in Indiana in 1952, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2823.2s)]
*  Jim was not going to attract a congregation by ranting Marxist Leninist dialectical materialism, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2835.8399999999997s)]
*  even if he'd intended to or had the capability, which is questionable. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2840.88s)]
*  You know there's no doubt that he was a socialist flirting with communism at the time. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2846.16s)]
*  And maybe he considered himself a communist at this point. You know who knows? Ask a politically [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2849.7599999999998s)]
*  active 19 or 20 year old how they define their ideology and you're likely to get a different [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2854.48s)]
*  answer every few months. But he was probably engaging in a little revisionist history years [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2859.7599999999998s)]
*  later when he claimed to already be in 1952 a full-on communist consciously infiltrating the [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2866.8799999999997s)]
*  church to subvert it for the revolution. More likely his beliefs were in flux and his motivations [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2871.8399999999997s)]
*  were mixed. Marceline was deeply unhappy at the time and their marriage had been on the rocks. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2877.6s)]
*  But everything changed with his decision to join the ministry as a Methodist no less, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2885.04s)]
*  the denomination in which Marceline had been raised. Rather than cynically hiding his atheism [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2889.44s)]
*  to hide his political activism under the cover of religion, I think it's much more likely that he [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2895.52s)]
*  simply had doubts. Doubts which later solidified into rejection. But he put those doubts aside [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2900.32s)]
*  with the rationalization that what was important was the social message. In any case Jim's doubts [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2906.88s)]
*  were a recent phenomenon which is why his atheist turn came as such a shock to Marceline. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2912.7200000000003s)]
*  I mentioned that Jim's father had been a first world war veteran with lungs badly scarred by [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2919.2000000000003s)]
*  a gas attack. When he returned from the war he had trouble drawing enough breath to hold [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2923.6800000000003s)]
*  a conversation let alone a job and so he settled into a life of pain and resigned self-pity. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2929.84s)]
*  He had neither the energy nor the interest to raise his only son. Jim's mother was more energetic [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2937.2000000000003s)]
*  but all of her energy went into working to support the family. A role that she had never planned for [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2942.96s)]
*  and deeply resented. Jim was often left alone as a child. Neighbors recalled years later finding him [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2947.36s)]
*  as a toddler wandering the roads of their small town naked. He was as a toddler wandering on naked [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2956.88s)]
*  with dried excrement caked on his backside. As he got a little older he started to learn how to get [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2962.8s)]
*  attention from adults other than his parents. He would tailor his performance to whatever he [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2969.36s)]
*  thought would hold the attention of his audience. At four years old he learned that he could get [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2976.1600000000003s)]
*  laughs out of the young men at the auto shop by cursing at them. You know they couldn't get enough [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2981.52s)]
*  of it. Little four-year-old Jimmy Jones calling him low down no good god damn sons of bitches [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2985.04s)]
*  and whatever else he could think of that he learned from his mother as she sat with him at the dinner [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2990.8s)]
*  table. Chain smoking complaining to him about the dirty no good bastard she worked for down at the [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2995.04s)]
*  factory or your cannery. The reaction of adults to finding him running around naked taught him another [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=2999.92s)]
*  way of getting attention by transgression. A lot of stories about this survived. Some of them are [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3006.48s)]
*  pretty funny like the one that had four or five-year-old Jimmy walking into a church [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3011.68s)]
*  in the middle of a service with no pants or underwear on just hanging out accompanied by [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3017.04s)]
*  an entourage of dogs and cats marching up the aisle to the preacher and presenting with a bouquet [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3022.16s)]
*  of flowers. The dogs and cat Jim he collected strays and pets from a very early age. You can [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3027.04s)]
*  imagine for a lonely kid you know without a lot of friends you can maybe see why that would happen [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3034.96s)]
*  but it was a practice that he would continue even as an adult not only with animals but [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3039.92s)]
*  later when he began collecting and keeping stray people. People in Lynn recalled that after a while [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3045.12s)]
*  he would rarely go anywhere without being surrounded by his pets and later his mother remembered that [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3051.84s)]
*  she often worried that she wouldn't even be able to discipline him for fear that his animals might [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3056.56s)]
*  mount a defense. So Jim's childhood eccentricities were on full display in a town of maybe 900 [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3060.2400000000002s)]
*  people. It's a tiny town so it's not as if people looked out their windows and saw some stranger boy [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3069.84s)]
*  wandering naked down the street. Everyone knew everyone else. They saw the Jones boy [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3075.28s)]
*  wandering naked down the street. You know his mother Lynetta she's at work his father old [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3080.08s)]
*  Jim is down at the veterans hall playing cards and for some reason kind of odd to most people [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3085.1200000000003s)]
*  Lynetta had a rule that the boy wasn't supposed to be in the house alone during the day which left [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3091.44s)]
*  him to his own devices outside pretty much all the time. It was a small town very small town and [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3096.24s)]
*  people knew each other's business. In the style of the time the townspeople didn't call the [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3102.3999999999996s)]
*  authorities but they tried to make up for the deficiencies of Jim's upbringing themselves. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3108.8799999999997s)]
*  The housewives who saw him wandering around often took him in fed him cleaned him up and many of [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3113.3599999999997s)]
*  them tried to see to the neglected spiritual education of the young boy. Despite being a town [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3119.52s)]
*  of only a few hundred Lyn had no fewer than a dozen churches and on Sundays the economic life [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3125.52s)]
*  of the town just shut down as the men and women donned their Sunday clothes gathered up the kids [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3132.24s)]
*  and marched off to church. That Jim's family had no church and apparently as far as anybody could [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3136.88s)]
*  tell no religion that was very much an aberration in their town and it was one that was noticed by [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3142.48s)]
*  everybody in the place. One lady in particular took Jim in and kind of became something of a [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3148.0s)]
*  daytime surrogate mother kept him off the streets fed him um discoursing to him about the affairs [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3155.28s)]
*  of God and man while he ate you know sandwiches and it was with her that he began attending church [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3161.68s)]
*  an arrangement you know his mother didn't mind figured it wouldn't hurt anything and it gave [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3167.68s)]
*  her time alone on Sundays and so that's how religion initially became a part of Jim's life [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3171.12s)]
*  and he kind of took it from there. When he was a little bit older he started going to different [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3177.44s)]
*  churches to see what they were like by himself sometimes he would go to multiple churches on the [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3181.76s)]
*  same Sunday and people got used to seeing you know young Jimmy Jones popping in and out of their [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3186.8s)]
*  services. That kind of makes him sound like a tourist but I don't I don't mean to give that [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3191.5200000000004s)]
*  impression because I don't think that's what was going on I mean this was a small tightly knit [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3197.1200000000003s)]
*  rural town in the 30s and 40s its people were Anglo and German and as conventional as a postcard. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3202.32s)]
*  Jim was an outsider even as a child he felt he felt that in his bones he felt like an outsider [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3209.8399999999997s)]
*  his mother who like him had dark hair that by much of the community was thought to speak of [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3219.2799999999997s)]
*  Indian blood had never intended to become trapped in a small town as a hardworking wife to a [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3226.08s)]
*  prematurely aging invalid veteran. She had dreams of going into business she had four years of [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3230.3199999999997s)]
*  college she had also dreamed of becoming a writer she was interested in you know not so much in [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3236.24s)]
*  Christianity but in reincarnation and other spiritualist ideas you know not and certainly [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3241.68s)]
*  not the folk Christianity of the simple people in Lynn but the depression changed a lot of people's [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3246.7999999999997s)]
*  plans and this is where she ended up. She complained to Jim each night about his good for nothing [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3252.72s)]
*  father and the injustice of her lot she impressed upon him that it was his responsibility to become [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3258.3999999999996s)]
*  a great man not just for himself for both their sakes she had been thwarted by circumstance and so [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3264.16s)]
*  they'd ended up trapped in a place that they didn't really belong among people who weren't [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3270.72s)]
*  really their people it would be up to Jim to make all her sacrifices worth it. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3276.08s)]
*  And so in many ways Jim's early life was almost custom designed to produce a pathological [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3283.2s)]
*  narcissist. That's what happened he learned that he was absolutely special and unique [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3291.28s)]
*  and had that drummed into him every day and yet he was unable to get any attention or love at all [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3298.2400000000002s)]
*  from the two people from whom a child especially one so special and unique should expect to receive [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3304.88s)]
*  it. Narcissism only superficially resembles self-love we confuse it with with vanity and [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3310.8s)]
*  we confuse it with with vanity and it's not that you scratch beneath the thin paint and [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3319.6800000000003s)]
*  narcissism always has much more to do with self-loathing. Self-loathing and doubt is only [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3326.1600000000003s)]
*  the natural response of a child who cannot even get his parents attention no matter how confidently [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3332.96s)]
*  he seems to perform in his you know wild and unending attempts to capture the attention and [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3338.0s)]
*  love of others. So Jim was an outsider deep down in a place and a time where it was not such a [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3342.88s)]
*  common condition you know he was a sort of huck fin only with all the pathos and and emptiness [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3352.08s)]
*  implied by such a fate when you strip it from its literary context and set it loose in the real world [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3359.6s)]
*  in the real world the huck fin story does not go so well for that boy. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3364.8s)]
*  He knew that the other kids parents went to church he knew the other boys fathers took them fishing [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3368.08s)]
*  he knew the other kids had homes that weren't dark and bare and he knew that many other things [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3372.7999999999997s)]
*  were different about his family and that everyone else knew these things too. Well church was his [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3378.96s)]
*  window into the world that he was excluded from into the lives of normal people of the into the [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3384.56s)]
*  life of the community he couldn't get enough of it and that was why he went to as many services [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3391.6s)]
*  he could trying to take it all in. Eventually he made his way to the Pentecostal Church [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3396.4s)]
*  which had been set up in town not too many years before. If Jim felt like an outsider in Lynn [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3402.56s)]
*  so did most of the Pentecostals. The congregation was mostly made up of Southerners that had [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3408.96s)]
*  migrated up from Kentucky and Tennessee looking for work during the Depression. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3413.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever been to or seen a Pentecostal service but I mean these people know [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3418.48s)]
*  to have a good time when they're in church instead of placidly singing out of a you know [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3423.04s)]
*  and I like traditional services and overall I tend to lean that way in general but [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3427.84s)]
*  I get it instead of placidly singing songs out of a hymn book they sing at the top of their lungs [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3432.64s)]
*  they're waving their arms in the air and dancing in the aisles the spirit moved them you know some [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3438.56s)]
*  of them they speak in tongues and just look that up on YouTube if you don't know what it is [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3442.88s)]
*  and just look that up on YouTube if you don't know what it is [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3448.64s)]
*  you know they're shouting to the preacher as he's given his sermon amen and hallelujah as he [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3452.08s)]
*  bounds across the stage booming out the word of God I mean it's a party they know how to get down [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3457.6800000000003s)]
*  sometimes they stage faith healings or members seized by the Holy Ghost would stand up and make [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3463.28s)]
*  a prophecy these rowdy Southerners and their boisterous church were kind of viewed with [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3467.44s)]
*  varying levels of alarm and contempt by the conservative denominational Christians in Lynn [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3472.56s)]
*  but Jim felt right at home [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3477.52s)]
*  now over the years Jim's interest in religion and ritual took sometimes odd forms in his younger [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3482.1600000000003s)]
*  years he would have other children over to gather in the loft of the family barn and they would [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3488.56s)]
*  listen as he would deliver lectures on religion and sometimes other subjects and he would manage [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3493.2000000000003s)]
*  this is remarkable a bunch of little little kids little boys and he would manage to hold their [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3498.32s)]
*  attention sometimes for hours with all these rules and he would dress up and mock vestments [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3502.72s)]
*  and he would create strict rules and hierarchy for the gatherings and how everything had to go [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3507.7599999999998s)]
*  boys don't like sitting around with all the he he it became very popular sometimes he would gather [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3512.3999999999996s)]
*  roadkill or other dead animals and he would decorate shoe boxes as their coffins and he [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3519.4399999999996s)]
*  would bring them and perform elaborate funeral rituals with the participation of his audience [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3524.24s)]
*  little weird there were periods when he would be seen going around town wrapped in a white sheet [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3528.56s)]
*  interrupting pastors by and Lynn and employing them to heed the word of God and to see to the [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3535.7599999999998s)]
*  fate of their souls you know this is like when he's in middle school [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3539.84s)]
*  yeah it must have been quite a sight for in a small town like Lynn for a little boy that [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3544.4s)]
*  everybody knew to be accosting adults on the streets to lecture them about religion [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3548.88s)]
*  and Jim's hearings were especially targeted at the card in billiards room where his father hung out [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3553.6000000000004s)]
*  it was a veteran center where some of the old veterans would go to play cards and shoot pool [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3559.36s)]
*  they didn't have alcohol on land it was it was a dry county people had to go across state lines to [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3564.88s)]
*  get alcohol but on a regular basis Jim would march down to the hall in his makeshift robe out of a [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3568.6400000000003s)]
*  white sheet and stand at the door and wave his bible and denounce all the men inside and one time [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3575.1200000000003s)]
*  he barged inside and stormed up to his father and shouted that he and everybody else was going to [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3580.32s)]
*  go to hell if they stayed in that place again this is about when he's in middle school or so [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3584.4s)]
*  early high school maybe and religion as he as he continued to grow up through middle school and [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3590.0s)]
*  into high school became more important to his life it became central really as his few elementary [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3595.6800000000003s)]
*  and middle school friends moved on from him in high school you know again they got into sports [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3603.6000000000004s)]
*  and beer and girlfriends and they couldn't really relate to Jim anymore he became increasingly [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3607.92s)]
*  isolated he spent his time at church and spent his off hours in the library reading you know [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3611.84s)]
*  when he was a teenager maybe 15 or 16 he had a fight with his father and he left the house [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3619.44s)]
*  the story is that Jim brought home a friend the friend was black and Jim's father didn't want the [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3626.64s)]
*  boy in the house and so Jim announced that if that was the case then he was not going to enter the [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3631.36s)]
*  house either and he left and he didn't see his father again for many years after that [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3635.12s)]
*  out of the house as a junior in high school Jim needed money so he took the job at the hospital [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3641.52s)]
*  in Richmond where he would meet Marceline hitchhiking the half hour there to work nights [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3646.56s)]
*  after class he was there in Richmond that Jim first saw the condition of African Americans [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3651.04s)]
*  manifested as a social issue it was something he'd read about before and he would read about [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3659.44s)]
*  individual instances well Lynn didn't have enough blacks his small town didn't have enough [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3665.92s)]
*  blacks for him to think of it beyond the context of occasional individuals [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3672.32s)]
*  African Americans came through Lynn every once in a while and you know he identified with them as [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3677.52s)]
*  fellow outsiders especially since when they went to church it was the Pentecostal church that they [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3681.84s)]
*  would go to the only one in town that would have them when Jim witnessed racism it was the kind [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3686.56s)]
*  that he'd seen from his father but Richmond had black neighborhoods black neighborhoods that were [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3692.4s)]
*  of a visibly lower quality than other neighborhoods even the nearby Italians on whom the Anglo-German [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3698.7999999999997s)]
*  Protestant Corps of the town also kept a wary eye and I don't want to overstate things we're [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3704.7999999999997s)]
*  not talking about the deep south here but you know it was a place in time where blacks were [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3710.48s)]
*  expected to be deferential and the word nigger was used casually as a mere descriptive noun so [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3714.64s)]
*  common that it you know it didn't even intend offense that's just what they called people [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3721.3599999999997s)]
*  the Protestants divided the north side Catholics into good Italians and bad Italians and if you [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3727.52s)]
*  were one of the good Italians you got along just fine there were rules and customs that we would [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3733.04s)]
*  definitely consider unacceptable and ugly today but often the ugliness of conventions isn't laid [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3738.08s)]
*  bare until someone tries to defy them and Richmond was a place where people mostly followed the rules [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3743.2s)]
*  but to an outsider looking in someone like Jim who didn't identify with the regime of rules [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3749.9199999999996s)]
*  and customs but instead identified with the people excluded by that regime from respectability [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3755.8399999999997s)]
*  he saw it all very clearly from the beginning [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3761.8399999999997s)]
*  almost as soon as he began making the trip to work at the hospital in Richmond [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3766.3199999999997s)]

*  from Tim Reiterman author of the book Raven probably the best overall biography of Jones [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3774.7200000000003s)]
*  he writes quote in Richmond Jim began preaching on the streets to anyone who would pause for a [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3782.32s)]
*  while to listen some did so he kept going back he held his ministry on the north side of Richmond [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3788.2400000000002s)]
*  down by the railroad tracks in a predominantly black residential and industrial area [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3794.64s)]
*  his pulpit was the intersection of two streets with a tavern located on each corner [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3799.6000000000004s)]
*  watering spots for the workers his raven hair combed in place and his clothes straightened [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3804.48s)]
*  Jim cut a mature and respectable figure despite his smooth face and boyish features he hardly [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3810.48s)]
*  looked like a 16 year old from a farming hamlet his manly stature made him difficult to ignore [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3816.4s)]
*  as he stopped virtually everyone who strolled or groped out of the bars get out of the way many [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3821.84s)]
*  would snap brushing past the non-stop talker some shoved but he persisted some resented his [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3828.0s)]
*  presence but gradually hostility turned to tolerance once he had drawn four or five adults [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3834.24s)]
*  with his brazen technique Jim strode to the lamppost where he had placed a rolled up blanket in his [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3840.0s)]
*  jacket he unfurled the blanket on the ground before him inside was his bible using it as a prop [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3845.28s)]
*  he raised his voice and preached a mixture of christianity and equality of all men under god [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3853.12s)]
*  Jim had no reason to address racial issues when he preached in virtually all white lin [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3858.64s)]
*  but here in a town that was one-fifth black where the blacks were confined almost exclusively to the [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3863.44s)]
*  extreme northern and southern neighborhoods something needed to be said about race and poverty [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3868.96s)]
*  as he stood on that street corner waving the good book he stressed the need for brotherhood [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3874.48s)]
*  and tied the message to the written word of god in less than an hour he would collect a small crowd [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3878.8s)]
*  of 25 to 30 people in his blanket where the coins he needed to keep his mission moving [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3884.0s)]
*  end quote he's only this is a 16 year old kid stopping a bunch of grown men groping out of bars [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3889.36s)]
*  to preach to them and being successful at it um and and giving a message that you know wasn't [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3897.04s)]
*  particularly easy to give at a time like that and in that place you know rural rural eastern indiana [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3904.56s)]
*  19 in the 1940s and so this was jim's religion right up through the end of high school [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3911.92s)]
*  it was one way that marceline as well as her family had been put at ease despite some of jim's [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3918.2400000000002s)]
*  eccentricities and so his move toward hostile atheism when he was in college had the feel of [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3923.84s)]
*  a kind of the kind of intellectual and ideological swing to which student his [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3931.36s)]
*  age tend to be prone and his return to the fold when he decided to be a minister was kind of [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3937.76s)]
*  interpreted by marceline as the moderation that comes with maturity he'd gotten over that sort of [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3944.2400000000002s)]
*  that little stint with atheism in college and you know she she didn't question it [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3949.76s)]
*  that doesn't mean there was nothing to jim's claim that he saw the church as a vehicle for [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3955.52s)]
*  social activism you know he was probably exaggerating later on when he's talking [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3959.0400000000004s)]
*  about how he infiltrated the church and did this from the beginning with with clear eyes [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3964.08s)]
*  probably exaggerating but there's definitely something to it you know as evidenced by his [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3968.72s)]
*  activity upon making his decision in 1952 it wasn't just a job to him it wasn't just a [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3972.48s)]
*  he very quickly joined an indianapolis methodist church as an unpaid student pastor and just [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3980.24s)]
*  almost immediately began wearing out his welcome this was a small conservative all-white church [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3985.52s)]
*  virtually all churches were monoracial and it was very comfortably set in his ways it was not [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3992.0s)]
*  looking for change but if jim was going to use the church as a jumping off point for the revolution [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=3998.16s)]
*  those ways were going to have to be changed and when given the chance to preach jim would weave [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4004.72s)]
*  themes of racial and economic equality into his sermons it was something that the congregation [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4010.16s)]
*  wasn't used to they they came to church on sundays to hear about you know died and rose on the third [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4015.12s)]
*  day and basic gospel stuff from his position as a mere student pastor he's an unpaid volunteer who [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4019.84s)]
*  just came into this place like a very young kid he started reaching out to catholics and jews in [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4027.92s)]
*  indianapolis he tried to kickstart an effort to build a community center with them the project [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4032.4s)]
*  never got off the ground but it gives you an idea of you know he was not coming in just to be to sit [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4037.6000000000004s)]
*  in the back pew and kind of learn from the deacons here when he wasn't working one of his many jobs [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4042.6400000000003s)]
*  he was still working several jobs or volunteering at the methodist church he attended other churches [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4048.16s)]
*  he kept doing that very often in black neighborhoods and he would take marceline along [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4053.52s)]
*  who had never been exposed to the energetic worship of black gospel churches [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4057.92s)]
*  and she saw jim let loose in a way that she'd never seen before you she just [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4062.56s)]
*  he was singing out loud and waving his arms and dancing with everybody else like he'd been doing [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4066.8799999999997s)]
*  this his whole life which he had and she just was shocked by it and when he would go to these places [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4071.52s)]
*  jim would try to recruit blacks away from their home churches to come join his small methodist [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4078.08s)]
*  church and this went over about as well as you'd imagine his white working-class congregation was [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4083.2799999999997s)]
*  not looking for a large sudden influx of new members to their little church let alone a sudden [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4090.48s)]
*  large influx of colored members they may have been against racial oppression and for equal rights [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4096.64s)]
*  at least in principle but supporting social reform is different than wanting to be on the barricades [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4104.88s)]
*  jim considered this just rank hypocrisy it just drove him crazy it enraged him and so he just [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4111.28s)]
*  pushed ahead trying anyway but he ran into as much resistance from his potential black recruits as he [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4117.04s)]
*  did from the people at his white church you know who is this you can just imagine you know you have [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4123.28s)]
*  you're you're african-american at a church you've been going to your whole life who is this [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4129.6s)]
*  21 year old white student preacher attending their services and trying to peel off members [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4133.92s)]
*  to drive across town to an all-white methodist church even if they were interested in trying [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4139.04s)]
*  something new he couldn't promise that they'd be welcome and in fact he'd have to admit that [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4145.28s)]
*  they definitely would not be welcome and but he tried to convince them to endure that discomfort [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4150.5599999999995s)]
*  and join him in his attempt to integrate the church he was a larger principle at play and [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4155.5199999999995s)]
*  he's trying to recruit people for that most black pentecostalists and baptists were no more [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4160.24s)]
*  interested in turning their sundaes into social experiments than the white methodists were you [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4166.24s)]
*  know they wanted to go to church they wanted to sing and dance and praise god with their friends [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4171.36s)]
*  and family the way they'd always done if this young jim jones character was interested in civil [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4174.8s)]
*  rights and integration great if he scheduled a meeting or a reform march maybe they'd show up [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4180.96s)]
*  but you know scheduled on monday being forced to sit at separate lunch counters that feels like [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4186.32s)]
*  oppression but to blacks as well as whites at the time worshiping with people who knew and [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4193.04s)]
*  understood them that just seemed natural and so he didn't have a lot of success the 1950s were an [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4198.639999999999s)]
*  interesting time it was a religiously in america it's something that well it was a time of religious [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4205.679999999999s)]
*  revival in jim's recruiting efforts took him further afield and brought him into contact with [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4213.52s)]
*  a phenomenon that had exploded across the south and midwest especially in the years after the second [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4218.8s)]
*  world war in those years you know for the first time in human history the threat of global apocalypse [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4224.160000000001s)]
*  immediate and unexpected had become truly real communities under pressure like that tend to fear [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4232.0s)]
*  witches and demons and communists lurking in the shadows and throughout the 1950s [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4241.04s)]
*  us church membership grew at a rate that outpaced population growth that's something that's hard to [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4245.5199999999995s)]
*  even imagine today the enthusiasm spilled out of the mainstream denominations and overflowed the [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4251.5199999999995s)]
*  church buildings themselves into traveling tent revival meetings and and meetings in barns and [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4257.84s)]
*  revivals and warehouses and hanger bays requisition for the purpose thousands of religious entrepreneurs [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4262.8s)]
*  toured the countryside and cities holding meetings nightly for weeks at a time and then they'd move [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4269.6s)]
*  on somewhere else celebrity preachers like billy graham and aural roberts came out of this period [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4273.76s)]
*  but there were countless revivalists operating below that level under the radar bringing [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4281.52s)]
*  communities together for lively events that would often combine you know religious entertainment [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4286.88s)]
*  healing and prayer local vendors often set up stalls and local and traveling musicians and [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4291.92s)]
*  performers would join the revivalist to put on concerts and other shows the whole thing kind of [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4298.0s)]
*  took on the character of a traveling religious carnival in rural areas and even in many cities [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4302.16s)]
*  in the 1950s it was the best show in town many people came out of sincere belief curiosity or [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4308.88s)]
*  just for the show it's kind of difficult i think for a lot of us today to understand some of the [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4315.68s)]
*  dynamics that would have been involved in a religious event like this back then [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4323.04s)]
*  some of you will be familiar but if you're not from this world it can be very difficult to [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4328.16s)]
*  understand what's going on or what people get out of it i remember when i was a teenager i [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4331.68s)]
*  lived for a while in a tiny town up in montana with my grandparents and i would attend the tiny [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4336.72s)]
*  town's tiny little bible church with my grandparents the whole town had maybe a few hundred people and [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4342.4800000000005s)]
*  the preacher there at the church there there are a few i think actually i can't really remember [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4348.64s)]
*  he did his best but i don't really remember anything he ever might have said and i certainly [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4354.0s)]
*  don't remember being moved by it but every once in a while every few months or so another preacher [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4359.92s)]
*  a black man named jim baker pastor jim baker would come through he didn't have his own church [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4367.12s)]
*  but he was known by churches all over that part of the state somehow i don't i don't know how word of [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4373.68s)]
*  mouth i guess and at least two or three sundays a month he would make the drive out to some little [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4378.96s)]
*  church in the big sky state to preach the word and pastor jim baker could preach the freaking word [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4384.56s)]
*  he would get up there in his tan suit and dark red tie you know sometimes he'd open light maybe [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4391.6s)]
*  with a joke or two other times he'd start slow and quiet and heavy like thunder building on the [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4397.2s)]
*  horizon but man this dude had a rhythm and before long he's waving the bible over his head and [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4404.08s)]
*  sweat soaking through his suit and flying off his brow as he bounced from one side of the stage to [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4409.599999999999s)]
*  the other and his big giant voice is booming out about how you know god's son had given his life [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4414.24s)]
*  for us and had been tortured and humiliated for us and despite all our shortcomings and even though [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4420.0s)]
*  we were all like unfaithful wives caught in the act and you know despite the unsightly filth of [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4425.36s)]
*  our sins god's love remained within reach freely offered if only we'd repent i mean this guy was a [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4431.2s)]
*  high energy natural performer he could get down and so the people at this tiny little church [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4437.599999999999s)]
*  in montana they knew weeks in advance that jim baker was going to be coming to town [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4446.08s)]
*  and when that sunday came the church was packed i mean people you never saw at church people you [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4450.4800000000005s)]

*  and so after he was done delivering his sermon he'd lead the congregation in a few hymns and [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4462.8s)]
*  you know his booming voice is carrying everyone else to sing with volume and with a band and that [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4468.08s)]
*  they never displayed except when he was there the people would be pulled up to emotional highs and [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4472.56s)]
*  rare feelings of connections with their face that have been missing from their workday lives and [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4478.96s)]
*  even afterward they were they were visibly elated and emotionally spent from it and sometimes the [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4482.96s)]
*  effect on people would last for days people who never came to church would be moved to say how [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4490.08s)]
*  they needed to start coming again and you know after church families would hold potlucks on these [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4495.52s)]
*  sundays and the people at church would split up to each other's houses to go socialize and it was [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4501.280000000001s)]
*  always a mark of distinction and status in this little community to be the one who would host [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4507.28s)]
*  pastor jim baker there after church potluck you know and when he was there he would hold court [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4512.5599999999995s)]
*  and conversation with people about the sermon or about the state of the church or the state of [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4517.5199999999995s)]
*  america or the prospect of the end times whatever you know but when i think back on it now it was [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4522.24s)]
*  just really that people just wanted to be close to it wasn't they wanted to talk about any of those [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4528.5599999999995s)]
*  particular things people would huddle up to be around this guy he really was a minor celebrity [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4532.4s)]
*  you know with all the social and ontological implications that that term carries it's funny [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4537.44s)]
*  because this would have been what over 20 years ago and i don't know if i've thought about it [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4544.96s)]
*  since even even as i've been preparing this podcast i haven't thought about it until now but now [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4551.28s)]
*  as i'm remembering the experience it comes back very powerfully the pastor jim baker he was just [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4556.48s)]
*  a regular guy he was just some dude he had a normal job i don't i don't remember what it was and [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4562.32s)]
*  he just made the rounds as a guest preacher a few sundays a month and the churches would give him [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4567.36s)]
*  half of whatever went the collection played for making the drive out there something like that [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4572.16s)]
*  but but i want to say again with emphasis that he really was like a minor celebrity [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4576.96s)]
*  you think about like if you know you see a celebrity walking somewhere a movie star or [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4581.92s)]
*  you know somebody like that or if the president comes to town you see the president it's obviously [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4586.16s)]
*  a much larger scale but there's that there's almost is if somebody has an aura about them you [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4591.04s)]
*  know people around them get nervous and has physiological effects on them and there's higher [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4596.24s)]
*  and lower versions of that and this he was a minor celebrity among the people who knew him [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4601.679999999999s)]
*  and when he was coming to town there was real excitement and anticipation for it [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4605.92s)]
*  you know this regular guy with a regular job could do things just by using his voice just with the [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4610.5599999999995s)]
*  words he chose and the way he spoke them that not only moved his audience but brought a community [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4616.639999999999s)]
*  together in a way that would not have happened otherwise this social aspect of phenomena like [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4622.56s)]
*  this cannot be ignored in favor of a narrow focus on the credulity of the individuals being [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4629.120000000001s)]
*  overtaken by the certainty being projected by the man or or his ability to just articulate doctrine [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4634.320000000001s)]
*  or manipulate their emotions this is a group experience as much as an individual one or or [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4640.0s)]
*  else maybe you could say that the individual experience the effects of it were the result [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4647.84s)]
*  of participation in the group experience that's what someone like jim baker was selling to put it [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4651.52s)]
*  more crudely than i really intend it wasn't just his sermon the experience began before he ever [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4658.24s)]
*  arrived and it lasted after he left he was like an attractor who would who would come to your town [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4665.2s)]
*  and pull everyone together and transform or transmute their energy and then release everyone [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4672.48s)]
*  back into their normal lives slightly different than they were before if only for a while [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4677.919999999999s)]
*  joseph campbell used to enjoy retelling a story told by the old german anthropologist leo [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4684.16s)]
*  frobenius so the story goes one day frobenius was at his desk hard at work and his little daughter [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4689.5199999999995s)]
*  a little girl was running around the office tugging at him for attention and just [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4698.8s)]
*  generally being a pain in the butt and making a ruckus and so he looks around his desk and finds [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4703.44s)]
*  three used up burn matchsticks and he gives them to the little girl and he tells her that this is [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4708.96s)]
*  hansel and gretel and the witch and why doesn't she go play with him in the other room you know [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4714.0s)]
*  very quietly if you please so these were simpler times you know 100 years ago frobenius died in [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4718.08s)]
*  the 30s so that was good enough for the little girl and off she went and sometime later she comes [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4723.12s)]
*  running back to her father her eyes are full of tears and fear so that frobenius was he was [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4730.64s)]
*  worried that something had gone terribly wrong uh maybe she had hurt herself or something so she's [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4736.88s)]
*  weeping and terrified and clinging to her father and she says the witch she cries the the witch is [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4741.76s)]
*  in the other room and it's after her and she's weeping and holding on to him and the little [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4747.12s)]
*  girl wouldn't be pacified until her father had gone into the other room himself and [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4751.44s)]
*  retrieved the evil matchstick and right in front of her broke it in half and threw it in the trash [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4755.599999999999s)]
*  and broke the spell now we can hear a story like that and we say well you know it's a little kid [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4759.839999999999s)]
*  with an overactive imagination playing her silly game right but what i want to point out here is [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4767.04s)]
*  that the matchstick was not a witch when she received it from her father she didn't cast it [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4773.599999999999s)]
*  away in terror when he handed it to her it was through the process of play as she allowed [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4780.0s)]
*  herself to be submerged into the game blurring the borders between imagination and reality that [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4787.2s)]
*  suddenly at a certain point the matchstick became the witch it was revealed as the witch [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4792.32s)]
*  and again for us we say well yeah but it wasn't a witch it was a stick but what's important [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4800.32s)]
*  when we're talking about witches you know what is important when we're talking about witches [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4808.16s)]
*  witches aren't real period you know not not in this sense so what are we talking about when we [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4812.96s)]
*  talk about witches we're hearing this frobanious story a century after the fact third hand but [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4818.0s)]
*  here's a little girl who is full of real terror crying to her father for protection [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4824.4s)]
*  psychologically phenomenologically the witch was as real as anything [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4830.88s)]
*  we can say objectively the witch doesn't exist but you know objectivity isn't it's a it's a [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4837.36s)]
*  it's an abstraction of experience average doubt stood back from and observed but moment by moment [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4844.32s)]
*  subjectivity is all we've got and if there's a witch making you panic and cry and look for help [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4852.719999999999s)]
*  then that which is real as a fact of experience emotional experiences are engraved deeply enough [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4859.04s)]
*  into our being that reason has a full-time job keeping watch to take a more conventional religious [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4866.48s)]
*  example the catholic church maintains as dogma that the consecrated bread and wine taken in [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4872.639999999999s)]
*  communion are transfigured into the actual body and blood of christ and what can that even possibly [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4878.32s)]
*  mean to people like us what could it even possibly have meant to someone like aquinas who died almost [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4886.24s)]
*  a thousand years ago for that matter thomas aquinas was capable of a profound understanding [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4891.68s)]
*  of aristotle so a simple logical operation you know this bread and wine i know the baker and [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4896.4800000000005s)]
*  the winemaker they live across town my nephew plays t-ball with his son you know does not equal [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4902.8s)]
*  the flesh and blood of a body crucified long ago he was perfectly capable of that logical operation [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4907.92s)]
*  well this is the point of all the stained glass and the organs and the incense investments it's [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4913.76s)]
*  why the sacrament is conducted at the specific climactic moment in the service that it is [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4918.96s)]
*  all of it designed to submerge a group of people into the spirit of the thing all the way to the [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4924.24s)]
*  point where suddenly in their subjective psychological and emotional experience the [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4929.84s)]
*  bread and wine were transfigured for them just as the matchstick was for that little girl [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4936.08s)]
*  if she can cry over that thing turning into a witch they can feel you know the profound [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4943.2s)]
*  religious emotion of the bread and wine turning into something and we'll say well i've been to [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4948.16s)]
*  church i'm even catholic and i've certainly never heard of anything like that but of course we [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4956.4s)]
*  haven't you know god is dead for almost all of us even our most religious people we'll go our whole [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4961.68s)]
*  lives without meeting a single person with the faith of an aquinas or probably even the faith [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4968.0s)]
*  of a kicker guard but travel back in time and tell one of these people that bread is merely bread [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4973.12s)]
*  and wine is merely wine and neither can be anything else and they would tell you look yeah i get it [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4979.76s)]
*  okay i get what you're saying but i was there i held them in my mouth as close to me as anything [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4985.5199999999995s)]
*  could be what could you possibly have to teach me about what was real that day i can already feel a [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4991.599999999999s)]
*  lot of you guys pulling back on this one so um well i'm thinking of something else now so i'll [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=4998.32s)]
*  try to put it another way uh but keep that story about the witch in mind because i think if i can [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5002.8s)]
*  put this together correctly and pull it off it'll make sense what i'm trying to do just [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5008.08s)]
*  bear with me for a few minutes you know we're gonna try to find our way to how something like [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5012.8s)]
*  jones town happened i just i don't want to just give you a recitation of the known facts there [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5017.52s)]
*  are other podcasts and books for that and that's going to mean maybe going down some roads that [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5022.72s)]
*  may end in cul-de-sacs but we'll see where this one ends up [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5027.36s)]
*  your religious participation is a black box to a lot of people modern people it's just a mode of [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5031.839999999999s)]
*  behavior where um unless you're submerged in it all people see is the outer trappings and the whole [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5037.04s)]
*  inner life of the individuals and the groups involved is often opaque and baffling the memory [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5043.12s)]
*  i just had about pastor jim baker that was in the 1990s not the 1950s when religious belief and its [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5049.599999999999s)]
*  role in communities was much more solid much more real you might say you know jim baker would drive [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5056.0s)]
*  the number of worshipers in a little chapel in montana from its regular 30 up to maybe 50 to 100 [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5062.4s)]
*  back during the post-war revival we're talking about rural towns all over a county emptying out [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5068.8s)]
*  it's hundreds thousands of people gathered sometimes all night long for weeks at a time [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5073.76s)]
*  and so yeah anyway um i remember another time i was a bit younger than i was in montana maybe i [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5079.6s)]
*  was 12 or 13 when i was young i moved around a lot i was changing schools all the time usually [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5085.28s)]
*  a few times a year and i was a kid more or less left to my own devices and often uh by the influence [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5092.16s)]
*  of relatives i would find my way into church youth groups which in practice were only a marginally [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5099.679999999999s)]
*  more wholesome environment than my public schools but you know sometimes it's the margins that matter [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5105.36s)]
*  with things like this i suppose kept me off the streets and um often there were adults or older [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5109.759999999999s)]
*  kids who took an interest in me and provided some guidance when there might not have been anyone [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5114.72s)]
*  else around to do it at the time and so i remember a time when i was 12 or 13 and our church group [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5119.360000000001s)]
*  went to see the evangelist billy graham in sacramento california it was being held in the arena where [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5126.88s)]
*  the kings play basketball only the arena was entirely full and so there are areas set up outside [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5132.72s)]
*  with huge jumbotrons for the crowds outside there must have been 10 000 of us outside [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5139.2s)]
*  so you've got a full arena maybe 10 000 more people outside i remember being far enough away [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5144.96s)]
*  that the nearest jumbotron wasn't very jumbo and the giant sound system sounded far away so you [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5149.6s)]
*  have some idea of how many people were talking about from so far away the experience was kind [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5154.96s)]
*  of it had the muted effect of overhearing what you were assured and even kind of believe is a [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5161.92s)]
*  very profound message but from the next room over muffled through the walls you know i was distracted [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5167.280000000001s)]
*  most of us kids were we were trying to be serious and solemn but we were 12 and the screen and [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5173.2s)]
*  speakers were far away and the message didn't seem particularly different from what we were used to [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5178.96s)]

*  and still and soon as the music and the solemn tone of the preacher and that collective experience [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5211.12s)]
*  of shared attention brings the crowd into something like emotional attunement something starts to feel [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5220.08s)]

*  i remember well i remember as more kids and adults started going forward i began to feel [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5329.280000000001s)]
*  the pull as the preacher's voice picked up into a passionate prayer and more of my friends and [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5335.44s)]
*  their parents and the church youth leaders got up to join this crowd of thousands and thousands [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5342.16s)]
*  i started to feel like i was being left behind i saw kids i knew well goofballs who had ignored [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5347.679999999999s)]
*  the entire sermon cracking jokes right up to the end get up and go kids i knew had not been moved [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5355.5199999999995s)]
*  by the message but they were suddenly being animated by some unseen spirit blowing through [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5362.16s)]
*  the crowd and i remember consciously deciding that i would not go i wanted to you won't believe me [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5367.599999999999s)]
*  but you know at times i i literally almost felt as if my body was being lifted to its feet by an [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5376.24s)]
*  external force it literally felt that way and it took active resistance on my part to keep from [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5381.76s)]
*  getting up it felt like if i would have let my focus slip for a few seconds i would have already [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5386.96s)]
*  been up and moving with the herd but i planted myself on the ground and i refused to move [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5394.0s)]
*  because i couldn't locate the motivation in myself and wherever the pull was coming from it felt [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5399.84s)]
*  foreign and coercive i can only understand all this as a social phenomenon tapping into some [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5405.52s)]
*  deep instinct if it was just for the individuals people could have stayed in their seats and been [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5412.96s)]
*  led in silent prayer to save their souls but there's something about the affirmative public [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5419.52s)]
*  act of getting up in front of others who know you and the pressure the growing crowds begin to put [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5425.04s)]
*  on others to do the same and and most importantly of joining all those other people in that shared [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5431.12s)]
*  state of heightened emotion i know that a whole lot of those people were drawn up to the stage [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5436.08s)]
*  purely by social pressure and fear of missing out on whatever might be happening up there a fear [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5442.4s)]
*  that grew every time another one of their group got up to their feet sometimes i remember especially [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5447.36s)]
*  among the younger people whole groups would be hesitating until one of the popular and stronger [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5454.08s)]
*  personalities got up and then it was like the rest of the group had been given permission and they all [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5459.44s)]
*  got up and went together kids from rougher homes often got up for their own reasons maybe going [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5463.5199999999995s)]
*  forward at their own pace without checking to see if anyone was coming along or keeping up [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5469.76s)]
*  the well-integrated middle-class kids with two parents who attended church with them every week [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5475.12s)]
*  and did things like sing in the choir they tended to move in groups the children of church deacons [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5479.12s)]
*  and the choir leaders you watch these little kids taking their first cracks at leadership [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5485.68s)]
*  you know trying to manage the microcosmic social status inherited from their parents [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5493.04s)]
*  and shouldering the responsibility of being the first one to get up you know to get up first in [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5497.92s)]
*  a way that brought the others along each individual was thinking about you know his or her own life in [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5502.16s)]
*  the state of their souls maybe but you know sure but they were also navigating and reinforcing all [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5509.2s)]
*  these embedded social hierarchies affirming the structure of their groups their little miniature [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5514.48s)]
*  societies by their participation and silently negotiating their closeness and commitment to one [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5519.759999999999s)]

*  born and he did his duty and he got up to lead our group to the front where you know we were to [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5537.12s)]
*  receive our salvation i knew that in refusing to go up i wasn't only in dialogue with reverend graham [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5542.16s)]
*  and the good lord but that i was refusing to go up with the boy leading our group refusing his [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5549.52s)]
*  leadership and by implication casting some measure of judgment upon my peers who were submitting to it [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5554.72s)]
*  none of this was articulated or thought out it was negotiated by exchange looks and body language and [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5561.68s)]
*  vague emotions i was putting distance between myself and the rest of them even though it was [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5568.160000000001s)]
*  the last thing i wanted to do at the time the girl that i've been crushing on whose friends had for [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5574.32s)]

*  adolescent courtship she got up to go with the rest and when they'd gone about 10 feet she glanced [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5585.12s)]
*  back at me and one of her friends turned to wave me on but i stayed put and i knew i knew immediately [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5589.84s)]
*  intuitively on some level that that was over now too and then the strangest thing [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5596.4s)]
*  after the prayer after maybe 20 minutes or so when the crowds were shuffling back to their seats [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5604.0s)]
*  something had clearly changed many of the adults and children were transfigured their faces were [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5610.48s)]

*  instead of anxiously eyeing one another as they negotiated their pubescent status hierarchy [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5624.4800000000005s)]
*  my friends were walking back calm docile smiling at each other or else wearing masks of introspection [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5629.84s)]
*  or deep emotion as the smiling ones walked beside them with words of comfort and encouragement [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5636.88s)]
*  most of them had gone up there for reasons profane and personal i know it for a fact but once [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5642.64s)]
*  they were up there the personal faded into the background as they surrendered to this social ritual [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5648.4800000000005s)]
*  and they came back bonded they were the ones who had gone forward together and who had stood [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5656.4800000000005s)]
*  together in a state of emotion profoundly heightened by the orchestrators of the experience [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5662.32s)]
*  and made a public commitment to themselves and to each other and to god and they returned to their [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5667.68s)]
*  seats bound to one another in a way that they had not been just a few minutes before and it was very [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5672.72s)]
*  real both for them from the inside and for me from the outside and you know again i don't want [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=5677.44s)]

*  evidence as far as i can tell that jim's call for people to sign over their property to the church [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7926.88s)]
*  and work for the movement full time was an attempt to satisfy a psychological need he had to dominate [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7931.44s)]
*  and control them the same cultists cultish psychopathologies that would eventually lead him [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7936.32s)]
*  and them to their doom i don't think that's the best way to understand what's happening [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7942.08s)]
*  Jim Jones was a communist and he saw his movement certainly by the late 1950s first and foremost [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7946.24s)]
*  as part of the world communist movement any conflicts he may have had about whether he was [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7953.84s)]
*  merely a socialist supporting reform or a doctrinaire communist seemed to have been resolved at least [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7959.52s)]
*  by 1959 when a series of events beginning with the cuban revolution solidified his ideology [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7964.56s)]
*  in the mid 1950s in indiana he's still measuring his rhetoric according to what he thinks his [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7969.68s)]
*  audience can handle but by the late 1950s he's actually starting to string them along and [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7974.96s)]
*  and get a little more direct and with a few years he'll have shed any pretense at all [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7979.76s)]
*  the writer mitten that last passage echoed something that i mentioned at the beginning [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7984.88s)]
*  from douglas hide's book about communists when he said that jim was demanding more of his people [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7988.96s)]
*  than was usual for a christian church you know hide told us that he was a communist and that [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7992.96s)]
*  you know hide told us that the communists did this as a matter of policy [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=7998.8s)]
*  not because they were trying to overburden and overwhelm people in order to control them but [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8003.12s)]
*  because they knew that people hungered for it you know what jones is doing here asking people to [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8006.88s)]
*  donate their property and work full time for the church that sounds crazy sounds like something [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8012.96s)]
*  only a cult would do and that only brainwashed cult followers would agree to do but i want to [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8017.28s)]
*  drive home something i said at the beginning that the communists in the first half of the 20th [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8023.76s)]
*  century were not playing games they were dead serious and what jim was asking of his most ardent [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8027.28s)]
*  followers was only what communist parties around the world asked of theirs i mean think about this [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8032.639999999999s)]
*  in european countries where the communist party was stronger and more socially acceptable than in [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8038.96s)]
*  the u.s card carrying members made sacrifices that gave them an aura among mere sympathizers [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8043.28s)]
*  sacrifices that would be hard to find any analog for today in france and britain where [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8050.0s)]
*  communists actually held seats in parliament it was customary for a communist in parliament to [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8056.88s)]
*  hand over their entire salary as a member as a member of parliament over to the party to do the [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8062.4800000000005s)]
*  party's work and the party in turn would just pay them a small stipend a worker's wage for their [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8068.24s)]
*  personal expenses i mean imagine a member of parliament or a u.s congressman doing that today [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8072.72s)]
*  a little later when jim jones encouraged his followers to hand over their assets to the [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8079.2s)]
*  movement it included the wage or salary that they were earning from their regular job [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8082.88s)]
*  the people's temple in turn took care of their needs if they needed eyeglasses it was paid for [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8087.92s)]
*  if they needed medical or dental care and medicine it was paid for if they donated their home they [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8092.56s)]
*  lived in a people's temple home or apartment rent free and then they were given a small stipend for [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8097.28s)]
*  their personal spending money the same stipend received by those who quit their jobs to work [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8102.24s)]
*  full-time on temple projects critics of the temple point to all this is one of the most [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8106.32s)]
*  oppressive and bizarre aspects of temple life in its middle period but again it was in reality [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8112.08s)]
*  was no more than was being asked of communist members of parliament at the time in britain [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8116.88s)]
*  and france and for that matter no more than was asked of the apostles of christ as they set off [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8122.5599999999995s)]
*  on their world transforming mission in the first century jim constantly reminded his people that [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8128.48s)]
*  the apostles according to the bible pooled their property and distributed it to each according to [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8134.08s)]
*  his need a line i'll repeat because jones never got tired of repeating it his critics say that [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8138.56s)]
*  it was an example of him exploiting scripture to manipulate manipulate people but jones worked [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8144.56s)]
*  harder and stretched himself thinner than he asked of anyone else and he never all the way to the end [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8150.4800000000005s)]
*  never lived extravagantly in any case the bible does say that you know when the rich man came [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8155.92s)]
*  to christ and said he wanted to be one of his disciples the bible records jesus response [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8162.64s)]
*  okay sell everything you have give it all to the poor the rich man says he'll do it just give me a [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8167.28s)]
*  little time to go bury a dead relative and christ says no let the dead bury their dead [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8173.2s)]
*  that's hardcore you know but if that man was still tied down by old attachments he was not [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8181.04s)]
*  going to last where they were going and he was still welcome to come hear jesus speak to witness [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8187.44s)]
*  miracles and to join the crowds eating loaves and fishes just like the vast majority of jim [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8192.96s)]
*  jones followers many thousands of people eventually they didn't do anything more than go to church on [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8197.759999999998s)]
*  sundays maybe drop something in a collection plate but if you want to be a part of the movement if [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8202.16s)]
*  you want to be a disciple well you know if you want to give your life to the mission to change [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8208.08s)]
*  the world instead of just benefiting from that change it was going to mean total self-renouncing [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8214.0s)]
*  commitment and so the rich man departed from christ just as most declined to make the sacrifices [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8219.12s)]
*  asked by jim jones over the years and that was fine but there are a lot of people out there looking [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8225.36s)]
*  for a mission and some of them did accept not for nothing did douglas hide tell his catholic audience [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8231.52s)]
*  that a great number of communists especially among the leadership in britain were people who [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8238.880000000001s)]
*  had found in the communist party what they had first tried without success to find in the church [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8244.0s)]
*  they'd shown up looking for something to devote themselves to ready saying here i am put me to [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8249.12s)]
*  work i don't know exactly what to do but i'm here and i'm here to be put to work and despite all the [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8253.92s)]
*  suffering to be found within just a few blocks of the church building poor people homeless people [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8260.400000000001s)]
*  hungry kids widows prisoners alcoholics drug addicts the mentally ill despite all that the most [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8266.400000000001s)]
*  that could usually be found for these hyper motivated people to do was like setting up a [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8273.04s)]
*  chairs before a sunday service or some other menial task around the church [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8278.24s)]
*  it's not hard to understand why many of these people responded when the communist said hey [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8283.36s)]
*  we got plenty for you to do in fact as much energy and dedication as you've got [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8288.08s)]
*  is how much we've got for you to do and if you want to dedicate yourself to what we're doing [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8292.24s)]
*  really dedicate yourself you will be a part of our family not in the way the church says it part of [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8296.56s)]
*  our family but really in a way that you will feel in your bones your brothers and sisters in this [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8302.96s)]
*  movement will put themselves on the line for you they will go to jail rather than give you up [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8309.2s)]
*  and as people entered the movement they found that that was not cheap talk that it was a brotherhood [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8315.04s)]
*  and that the leaders were being asked to sacrifice as much or more than they were [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8320.32s)]
*  hide talks about an interaction he'd had with another man who was a former communist party [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8325.92s)]
*  member and like himself had left the party and stayed gone for good reasons [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8330.16s)]
*  but still remembered the whole experience very warmly hydrates quote i was talking to such a man [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8335.2s)]
*  on one occasion our conversation brought back very vivid to my own mind the extent of the dedication [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8342.48s)]
*  which had been common in the party in the days when we were both communist together often ex [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8348.32s)]
*  communists meeting together can talk of the old days when we were in the party rather like old [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8354.0s)]
*  soldiers discussing nostalgically the campaigns they shared in the past we had been doing this [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8358.16s)]
*  we had talked of old comrades who now saw themselves as our enemies of the campaigns [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8364.0s)]
*  in which we had engaged together then very wistfully he said do you remember what life [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8368.64s)]
*  was really like in the party you got up in the morning and as you shaved you were thinking of [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8375.28s)]
*  the jobs that you would do for communism that day you went down to breakfast and read the daily [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8379.92s)]
*  worker to get the party line to get the shot and shell for a fight in which you were already [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8385.28s)]
*  involved you read every item in the paper wondering how you might be able to use it for the cause [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8389.6s)]
*  i had never been interested in sport but i read the sports pages in order to be able to discuss [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8395.6s)]
*  sport with others and to be able to say to them have you read this in the daily worker [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8400.0s)]
*  i would follow this through by giving them the paper and the hope that they might turn from the [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8404.800000000001s)]
*  sports pages and read the political ones too on the bus or train on my way to work i read the daily [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8408.320000000002s)]

*  bring it back to me again at lunchtime in the canteen or the restaurant i would start conversations [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8435.119999999999s)]
*  with those with whom i was eating i made a practice of sitting with different groups in [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8440.64s)]
*  order to spread my influence as widely as i could i did not thrust communism down their throats but [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8445.039999999999s)]
*  steered our conversations in such a way that they could be brought around to politics or [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8450.16s)]
*  if possible to the campaigns which the party was conducting at the time before i left my place of [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8454.08s)]

*  life was good in the communist party end quote i think a lot of people can understand why something [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8500.400000000001s)]
*  like that would be appealing especially when you're doing with other people who are just as [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8507.36s)]
*  committed as you are this is a very real very powerful dynamic and it was very real in people's [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8511.6s)]
*  temple being a part of something special something important where your work was needed [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8518.16s)]
*  serving with people who were equally committed and who would stand with you when the going got [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8525.92s)]

*  to be pretty typical of radical political movements the people's temple did take these [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8559.2s)]
*  tendencies to extremes jim jones was not just building a political organization or a religious [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=8564.880000000001s)]

*  down the cubans that he and marceline were there as missionaries he said so he swore to the end [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=9819.92s)]
*  that they were absolutely american pilots and he asked for permission to take a picture of the [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RFT55ZhZWw&t=9825.44s)]
