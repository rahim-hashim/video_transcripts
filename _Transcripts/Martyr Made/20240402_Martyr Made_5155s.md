# The Prodigal Sons - Nietzsche and Dostoevsky (Novitate Conference, Nov 2023)
**Martyr Made:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs)
*  Hey everybody, this is Darrell Cooper and I thought I'd bring you a little Martyr Made [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=0.0s)]
*  bonus. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=9.18s)]
*  This is a talk I gave last year about Friedrich Nietzsche and Fyodor Dostoevsky at the Novatate [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=10.18s)]
*  Conference in Washington DC. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=16.76s)]
*  The Novatate Conference was created by Luke Burgess, author of the book Wanting, The Power [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life, to explore and celebrate the work of French scholar René [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=25.24s)]
*  Girard, of whom you've heard me speak a few times in the past. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=30.68s)]
*  Much of the material here will be familiar to those of you who have listened to the Underground [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=36.04s)]
*  Spirit, which was episode 20 of the Martyr Made podcast, but here you get it in a condensed [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=40.54s)]
*  90 minutes that you can send to your mom without asking her to listen to some dude she's never [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=46.08s)]
*  heard of for five hours. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=51.0s)]
*  Also I admit cutting it down to this length felt like choosing which fingers and toes [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=53.3s)]
*  I wanted to chop off. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=56.9s)]
*  There's a lot more stuff like this on the Martyr Made substack. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=58.82s)]

*  essays on the history of slavery and the lead up to the US Civil War. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=70.34s)]
*  I just released the third essay in that series and there are many many other essays, all [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=75.06s)]

*  thank you, thank you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=154.86s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=155.86s)]
*  I'll be the enforcer up here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=156.86s)]
*  How's it going everybody? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=157.86s)]
*  My name is Daryl Cooper and I'm just a podcast host. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=168.74s)]
*  Thanks for coming to hear me give this presentation. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=174.98000000000002s)]
*  This talk is about Friedrich Nietzsche and Fyodor Dostoevsky viewed through a lens that's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=177.54000000000002s)]
*  been furnished to us by René Girard. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=183.82000000000002s)]
*  I did a long four or five hour podcast on this topic but fortunately for all of you [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=186.94s)]
*  and unfortunately for me, Luke denied my request for a five hour speaking slot. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=191.46s)]
*  So I will do my best to get through this in the time we have. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  If it seems like I'm rushing, it's because I haven't had a chance to practice this in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  its final form because I was still fiddling with it at my table. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=206.02s)]
*  So if we reach the hour and you guys need to go, I won't hold it against you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  I'll finish up for the camera but I'll try to get it done in time. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=214.14s)]
*  Winston Churchill has been quoted saying that if you're not a liberal at 25, then you have [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=219.22s)]
*  no heart. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=223.82s)]
*  But if you're not a conservative by 35, then you have no brain. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=224.82s)]
*  It turns out unfortunately that Churchill never said that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=228.5s)]
*  And since the attribution is false, I feel liberated to reappropriate the quote for my [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=232.33999999999997s)]
*  own purpose. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=236.5s)]
*  In my version, you have no heart if you're not reading Nietzsche at 25. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=237.73999999999998s)]
*  But if you haven't moved on to Dostoevsky by 35, you know the rest. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=242.5s)]
*  I'm pulling your leg. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=248.5s)]
*  I still enjoy Nietzsche despite 35 quickly fading to the horizon in my rear view mirror. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=249.5s)]
*  But my appreciation for both the German philosopher and the Russian novelist has been profoundly [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=256.5s)]
*  enriched by reading each author through a lens furnished by the other. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=260.98s)]
*  And reading both of them through a lens provided to us by Professor Girard. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=265.98s)]
*  By applying his unique insight into the dynamics of desire and mimesis, René Girard was able [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=271.5s)]
*  to recognize that rarely have two authors been in such deep dialogue over the same questions. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=276.24s)]
*  The correspondences one finds in the work of Nietzsche and Dostoevsky are so plentiful [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=282.5s)]
*  and so specific that over the years some Nietzsche scholars have mistakenly assumed that he must [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=287.48s)]
*  have been paraphrasing or responding to a passage that he had read in Dostoevsky when [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=292.98s)]
*  in fact we know that both men had completed all of their major works before Nietzsche [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=298.58000000000004s)]
*  ever discovered him. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  Dostoevsky was 23 years older than Nietzsche. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=307.66s)]
*  Nietzsche didn't discover Dostoevsky until years after the Russians' death. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=310.02000000000004s)]
*  Yet despite the generational and geographic distance separating the two men, they shared [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=314.74s)]
*  many common experiences and the trajectory of their personal lives was uncannily similar, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=320.02000000000004s)]
*  at least the first half. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=325.1s)]
*  Both were sensitive children of stern conservative fathers. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=327.76000000000005s)]
*  Both boys were introduced early to reading and took refuge in books. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=331.56s)]
*  At an early age, both boys lost their father under circumstances that involved them personally [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=336.24s)]
*  and traumatically, and as adults they both labored under the shadow of the patriarch. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=342.1s)]
*  In their early 20s, both Nietzsche and Dostoevsky had a brief, very negative experience in the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=347.64000000000004s)]
*  military, and around the same age they even both had a traumatic experience with a horse [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=352.68s)]
*  that would haunt them for the rest of their lives. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=358.16s)]
*  At exactly age 24, each man was recognized for his talent and elevated into elite company, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=361.68s)]
*  only to be disillusioned after a year or two and then to slide into a decade of unproductive [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=369.16s)]
*  obscurity. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=374.52s)]
*  Each man emerged from exile in his mid-30s. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=376.8s)]
*  Only now they were headed down radically divergent paths that would lead one to redemption [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=379.92s)]
*  and the other to destruction. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=385.88s)]
*  Many of us have had experiences reading novels where we think that the author must have been [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=389.36s)]
*  writing this as a personal letter to us. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=395.32s)]
*  It gets us so well, or some aspect of us. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=397.96000000000004s)]
*  It may even be something that we didn't see or understand about ourselves before, or something [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=401.12s)]
*  we vaguely felt but hadn't been able to articulate. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=406.16s)]
*  Nietzsche had no problem articulating himself, but even the most clear thinking and articulate [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=409.84s)]
*  among us are often unclear and inarticulate when thinking or talking about ourselves, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  at least when we're trying to be honest. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=420.4s)]
*  A good novel can give us deep insight into ourselves precisely because we're often not [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=423.35999999999996s)]
*  honest with ourselves about ourselves. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=428.12s)]
*  Early in notes from the underground, Dostoevsky writes that, quote, every man has reminiscences [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=432.2s)]
*  which he would not tell to everyone, but only to his friends. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=438.12s)]
*  He has other matters in his mind which he would not reveal even to his friends, but [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=442.23999999999995s)]
*  only to himself, and then only in secret. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  But there are other things which a man is afraid to tell even to himself, and every [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=449.84s)]
*  decent man has a number of such things stored away in his mind. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=455.32s)]
*  Notes from the underground was the first book by Dostoevsky that Nietzsche discovered. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=461.24s)]
*  After a chain of unlikely coincidences, it grabbed his attention. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=465.44s)]
*  Actually the volume was titled The Underground Spirit, and it contained both notes from the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=470.24s)]
*  underground and a short story from earlier in Dostoevsky's career called The Landlady. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=475.76s)]
*  Nietzsche had found it in January 1887 at a bookshop in southern France where he'd stopped [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=481.84s)]
*  in to take a break from a long day of searching for a new apartment. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=486.88s)]
*  Nietzsche had never heard of Dostoevsky, and we can only guess what drew his attention [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=491.68s)]
*  to the underground spirit, but it is an educated guess. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=495.04s)]
*  You see the most recent piece of writing that Nietzsche had completed was a new preface [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=499.44s)]
*  for his earlier book Dawn, in which the very first sentence began, in this book you will [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=504.24s)]
*  find an underground man at work. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=510.22s)]
*  The narrator and protagonist from Notes from the Underground has never assigned a name [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=514.24s)]
*  in the book, and has come down to us even today simply as the underground man. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=517.78s)]
*  By this point in his life, Nietzsche was not much of a believer in coincidences. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=523.6s)]
*  He'd become increasingly superstitious, detecting hidden meanings in mundane daily events, and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  even wrote to a friend that, there is no longer any element of chance in my life. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=533.0400000000001s)]
*  The coincidence of finding a book about another underground man was enough for Nietzsche to [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=539.08s)]
*  put off his apartment search and dig a little more deeply. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=543.86s)]
*  The Landlady was the first of the two stories presented sequentially in the underground [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=548.46s)]
*  spirit, and so assuming Nietzsche turned to the first page upon picking the book up, the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=553.24s)]
*  very first line he would have read was, Ordinow, the protagonist of the Landlady, had finally [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=557.88s)]
*  decided to change his apartment. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=564.5999999999999s)]
*  To a man like Nietzsche, the unlikely coincidence of finding both another apartment seeker and [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=568.24s)]
*  a fellow underground man at work within the first few moments of picking up the underground [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=573.3199999999999s)]
*  spirit would have been irresistible, especially as the correspondences continued to pile up. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=578.32s)]
*  Nietzsche's most important book, as far as he was concerned, a book he considered to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=584.8s)]
*  be a text of almost sacred knowledge, which would one day have entire universities dedicated [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=588.72s)]
*  to plumbing the depths of its teachings, was thus big Zarathustra. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=593.96s)]
*  In it, Nietzsche has his avatar, Zarathustra, come down to the world of men in his fortieth [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=598.92s)]
*  year to share the wisdom that he has accumulated after ten years of isolation up in the mountains. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=605.12s)]
*  Nietzsche was himself in his early forties when he wrote Zarathustra, and like Zarathustra, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=612.12s)]
*  he had spent much of the last decade in relative isolation and obscurity. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=616.64s)]
*  Dostoevsky, too, was forty years old when he wrote notes from the underground, and he, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=621.72s)]
*  too, had only just emerged from a decade of exile. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=626.5600000000001s)]
*  The underground man is Dostoevsky's avatar, just as Zarathustra is Nietzsche's, but notes [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=631.12s)]
*  from the underground is a dark mirror of Nietzsche's magnum opus. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=637.2s)]
*  When Zarathustra made the decision to descend from his mountain ridout, he first addressed [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=641.9s)]
*  the sun, saying, Thou great star, what would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=646.44s)]
*  whom thou shinest? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=652.72s)]
*  He says he's like a bee who's gathered too much honey and now must give it into the waiting [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=655.02s)]
*  outstretched hands of humanity. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=659.6s)]
*  Like Zarathustra, Dostoevsky's underground man is exactly forty years old when he makes [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=662.84s)]
*  his appearance in the world of men, but he is crawling up out of his hole rather than [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=668.34s)]
*  descending from the mountaintop. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=673.6s)]
*  Dostoevsky's character has none of Zarathustra's pretensions regarding the value of his wisdom, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=677.08s)]
*  and early in his story he says, We underground folk, though we may sit forty years underground [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=681.0s)]
*  without speaking, when we do come out into the light of day and break out, we talk and [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=686.16s)]
*  talk and talk. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=691.68s)]
*  You must excuse me for being overly philosophical. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=694.1999999999999s)]
*  It's just the result of forty years underground. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=696.8s)]
*  Nietzsche's Zarathustra has come down to humanity to preach the ubermensch, the overman, the [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=699.8s)]
*  radically free individual who has cast off the fetters of social convention and in his [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=707.8399999999999s)]
*  freedom and outlook is as different from men as men are from apes. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=713.04s)]
*  Dostoevsky's underground man has come up to humanity to expose the true nature of this [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=718.76s)]
*  radically free individual. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=723.92s)]
*  Practically chapter by chapter and line by line, Dostoevsky responds to the major ideas [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=727.28s)]
*  with which Nietzsche had been grappling in books he'd written over the past several years. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=731.56s)]
*  The parallels to Nietzsche's biography, his personal biography, only set the hook more [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=736.56s)]
*  firmly. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=741.64s)]
*  Nietzsche had suffered since childhood from chronic illnesses, an experience he held in [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=743.8599999999999s)]
*  common with Dostoevsky, and by that day in the bookstore his health was in terminal collapse. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=748.0s)]
*  The first line he would read in notes from the underground was, I am a sick man. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=753.92s)]
*  Nietzsche by this point had given up trying to track or improve his health through medicine [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=760.16s)]
*  and took pride in his ability to push through illness and chronic pain, famously boasting [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=765.14s)]
*  that what doesn't kill me makes me stronger. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=770.22s)]
*  Dostoevsky's underground man, too, takes a sort of pride in his infirmities and he, too, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=774.06s)]
*  refuses to consult a doctor about what ails him. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=779.3s)]
*  In the same chapter, Nietzsche would read that the underground man, like himself, survived [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=782.98s)]
*  on a modest fixed income after retiring early from work. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  He would read that the underground man, again like himself, had withdrawn from the social [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=791.16s)]
*  world and had no strong connections to friends or family. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=796.0799999999999s)]
*  The underground man was a more sensitive and intelligent person than most of the people [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=800.6s)]
*  around him, yet he was unsuccessful in his life and attributed the success of others [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=804.92s)]
*  to their stupidity and to their willingness to play social games to which he would not [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=810.62s)]
*  lower himself. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=815.18s)]
*  All of this, Nietzsche would have found darkly familiar. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=817.18s)]
*  Nietzsche would spend the next two years, the last two years before he went insane, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=822.18s)]
*  seeking out translations of any Dostoevsky books he could find. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=827.5s)]
*  He called the Russian the only psychologist from whom I had something to learn, and yet, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=831.66s)]
*  though Nietzsche was, quote, grateful to Dostoevsky in a very special way, he constantly offends [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=837.54s)]
*  my most basic instincts. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=843.66s)]
*  You see, if you only read Nietzsche's books, you might think they were the work of a warrior [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=846.98s)]
*  poet, as if Beowulf or Siegfried had taken up the pen and decided to tell us about Schopenhauer. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=851.82s)]
*  But Nietzsche the man was very different from Nietzsche the author, who would have considered [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=859.62s)]
*  the real man to be exactly the kind of weak, sickly, timid, and unsuccessful person Nietzsche [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=863.1s)]
*  condemned to the social Darwinian dustbin in his later works. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=870.78s)]
*  And viewed alongside his rather pathetic personal biography, those later works appear as a kind [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=875.82s)]
*  of special pleading on the part of Nietzsche. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=882.0600000000001s)]
*  And it was his encounter with Dostoevsky, I believe, that finally forced Nietzsche to [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=884.98s)]
*  confront the discrepancy between his life and the values that he professed. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=889.4200000000001s)]
*  It was a confrontation that would have tragically devastating consequences. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=894.6600000000001s)]
*  Many of you will have read Notes from the Underground, but I imagine somewhat fewer [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=900.34s)]
*  of you have worked your way through Dostoevsky's all the way down to the Landlady. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=903.7s)]
*  Dostoevsky wrote it during his earlier period, and while it is not a masterpiece like Notes, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=909.34s)]
*  it may have had as much to do with grabbing Nietzsche's attention as Notes. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=914.6600000000001s)]
*  The uncanny correspondences to Nietzsche's biography went far beyond the main character [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=919.34s)]
*  seeking a new apartment, as Nietzsche had been doing when he happened across the book. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=923.62s)]
*  In fact, the plot had many parallels with a very significant and formative event in [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=927.9000000000001s)]
*  his own life, namely his relationship and eventual falling out with the famous composer [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=932.14s)]
*  Richard Wagner. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=938.5s)]
*  Nietzsche and Wagner met in the late 1860s, while Nietzsche was still a student at Leipzig. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=941.34s)]
*  Wagner was already very famous, towering over the German cultural scene, and he kept a circle [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=947.9s)]
*  of reverent admirers and hangers-on, including many who were culture figures in their own [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=952.66s)]
*  right. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=957.3s)]
*  At the time of Nietzsche's introduction, Germany had not yet been unified into a single country, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=959.02s)]
*  but mass enthusiasm for Germanic nationalism was thick in the air. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=963.66s)]
*  Wagner and his circle saw themselves as historic figures, self-consciously involved in forging [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=968.62s)]
*  a shared cultural heritage for this emerging Germanic nation. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=974.4s)]
*  So Wagner's soirees were charged with the sense of being involved in a great task, and [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=980.12s)]
*  those invited to participate were expected to bring their A game. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=986.18s)]
*  Nietzsche had come well recommended. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=990.78s)]
*  He had recently accepted the chair of classical philology at the University of Basel, making [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=992.9799999999999s)]
*  him the youngest full professor at 24 in the history of the Swiss university system, and [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=997.5s)]
*  perhaps in all of Europe at the time, despite the fact that he had not even yet completed [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1003.02s)]
*  his doctorate. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1008.2199999999999s)]
*  Apparently, the men overseeing his program at the University of Leipzig felt they had [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1009.42s)]
*  seen enough, because they waived the required thesis and examination, awarded Nietzsche [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1013.38s)]
*  his doctorate, and sent him on his way. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1018.58s)]
*  Nietzsche was brilliant enough to stand out among Wagner's many brilliant friends, and [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1021.54s)]
*  soon was elevated into the composer's inner circle. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1026.58s)]
*  Wagner's charisma was legendary, and he had tremendous pull over everyone around him. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1031.26s)]
*  Once, after a scandal involving an affair between Wagner and the wife of his friend [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1036.58s)]
*  and follower, Hans von Buhle, courtiers who were jealous of the influence Wagner had over [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1042.18s)]
*  King Ludwig II pressured the king to make Wagner leave Bavaria. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1046.78s)]
*  Wagner agreed to relocate, but not before having to personally talk Ludwig out of abdicating [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1052.18s)]
*  his throne to move away with him. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1057.98s)]
*  Nietzsche was not immune to Wagner's pull, and he was intoxicated by the rarefied air [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1061.62s)]
*  into which he had been swept up. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1065.98s)]
*  The most important figure in this circle was, of course, Richard Wagner himself, but at [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1069.06s)]
*  the center of the circle stood a woman named Cosima, the son around which Wagner and several [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1073.94s)]
*  of his closest friends orbited. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1079.82s)]
*  Cosima was Wagner's mistress and the wife of Hans von Buhle, a member of Wagner's inner [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1082.7s)]
*  circle. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1088.26s)]
*  Hans von Buhle had been the most prominent student of her father, the famous pianist [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1089.7s)]
*  and composer Franz Liszt, who was also a member of Wagner's inner circle. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1094.06s)]
*  Therefore, when Nietzsche was welcomed into the club, the three most important figures [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1099.06s)]
*  – Liszt, von Buhle, and Wagner himself – all had a solicitous love relationship to this [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1103.62s)]
*  woman. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1109.74s)]
*  Liszt, obviously, only as her father, but she was at the center of everyone's affectionate [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1110.74s)]
*  attention. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1115.22s)]
*  To put it in a manner more appropriate for today's topic, Cosima was the object of [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1116.98s)]
*  everyone's mimetic desire. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1121.3799999999999s)]
*  And so you will not be surprised to learn that, before long, Nietzsche, too, falls in [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1123.82s)]
*  love with Cosima. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1128.1799999999998s)]
*  Twenty years had passed since he'd been introduced to Richard and Cosima Wagner, ten [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1131.86s)]
*  since a catastrophic falling out with the couple. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1136.34s)]
*  That the disastrous end to their relationship was still an open wound for Nietzsche is evidenced [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1140.06s)]
*  by the fact that most of the books he'd written in the years since criticized Wagner either [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1144.54s)]
*  directly or indirectly. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1148.82s)]
*  Although Nietzsche had not spoken to Cosima in many years, one of the very first things [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1151.46s)]
*  he did in the days after losing his mind in 1889 was to write her a love letter, a detail [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1156.3000000000002s)]
*  that suggests the whole experience was never far from the surface of Nietzsche's mind. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1162.46s)]
*  So let us return to the bookstore in southern France. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1168.5200000000002s)]
*  Nietzsche notices a book called The Underground Spirit and picks it up on account of having [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1172.0600000000002s)]
*  written in his most recent essay that it was the work of an underground man. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1176.0200000000002s)]
*  One of the two stories contained therein, Notes from the Underground, is also described [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1180.7s)]
*  as the work of an underground man and seems to be in direct dialogue with much of Nietzsche's [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1184.3600000000001s)]
*  work over the last many years. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1188.7s)]
*  The other story, The Landlady, begins with the line Ordinow had finally decided to get [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1191.14s)]
*  a new apartment, just as Nietzsche had been out searching for an apartment when he stopped [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1195.5800000000002s)]
*  into the bookstore. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1200.04s)]
*  So Nietzsche finds a corner, settles in, and reads a story about a young reclusive scholar, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1202.2s)]
*  who has been invited into the home of a couple, a young, lovely woman named Katerina and a [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1209.1s)]
*  mysterious older man named Murin, who holds Katerina in thrall. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1213.9399999999998s)]
*  Ordinow, of course, soon falls in love with Katerina and the two become very close. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1220.9399999999998s)]
*  The two of them are much closer in age than she and Murin, just as Nietzsche and Kosima [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1225.5s)]
*  were much closer in age than she and Wagner. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1230.04s)]
*  But it soon becomes clear that the older man has too much power over Katerina for Ordinow [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1233.5s)]
*  to pry her away. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1237.58s)]
*  People often spoke of Richard Wagner as holding people under some kind of trance or spell. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1240.58s)]
*  Hans von Bülow, when his wife's affair with Wagner became a public scandal and she asked [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1247.02s)]
*  him for a divorce, took the matter in stride and simply deferred to his master. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1251.1799999999998s)]
*  He famously invoked the story of Theseus, Dionysus, and Ariadne, in which Theseus, a [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1256.34s)]
*  human, is married to Ariadne but gives her up to Dionysus, a god, after the god stakes [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1261.5s)]
*  his claim. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1267.38s)]
*  According to one version of events, von Bülow said, when a woman is torn between a man [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1269.5800000000002s)]
*  and a god, meaning between himself and Wagner, it is excusable for her to choose the god. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1274.38s)]
*  Kosima was every bit as enraptured by her husband as everyone else. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1282.5s)]
*  She held him in awe and was utterly devoted and subject to him. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1286.0800000000002s)]
*  Years earlier, not long after they had first met and she was still married to von Bülow, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1290.38s)]
*  Niki and Wagner were alone in a room and Kosima literally fell at his feet, weeping, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1295.18s)]
*  practically worshipping him. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1299.8600000000001s)]
*  She would spend the remainder of her life, after Wagner's death, working to increase [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1302.0600000000002s)]
*  his fame and spread his work. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1305.66s)]
*  In other words, like Ordinov in Dostoevsky's story, Nietzsche had fallen in love with a [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1307.54s)]
*  married woman who was intensely devoted to her husband. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1311.8600000000001s)]
*  There's a part in the Landlady where Ordinov tries to stand up to Murin, the old man, but [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1316.22s)]
*  he wilts at the critical moment and then Katarina falls at Murin's feet, weeping. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1320.82s)]
*  It's also hinted that Murin may have originally been the lover of Katarina's mother and that [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1326.1s)]
*  he and Katarina ran off together after Murin had killed her father. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1330.6599999999999s)]
*  Nietzsche had wandered into Wagner's circle where Kosima was, at the time, still married [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1335.34s)]
*  to von Bülow, even though she had already had children with Wagner, whose work was being [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1339.6599999999999s)]
*  promoted by Kosima's father, Franz Liszt, who was the teacher of her cuckold husband [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1344.3s)]
*  von Bülow. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1348.86s)]
*  Two of Wagner's children with Kosima carried von Bülow's surname because they were born [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1350.7s)]
*  when she was still married to him. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1355.02s)]
*  Now obviously the details are different, but suffice to say that both Ordinov and Nietzsche [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1357.42s)]
*  found themselves involved in a strange, pseudo-incestuous situation and fallen in love with a young [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1362.14s)]
*  woman who was enthralled to a powerful older man who seemed to hold everyone around him [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1368.6200000000001s)]
*  under a spell. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1373.66s)]
*  Nietzsche never did make an open play for the hand of Kosima while Wagner was still [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1376.18s)]
*  alive, and as far as we know, the rivalry never broke out into the open. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1379.78s)]
*  In a way, the plot of The Landlady plays out in a similar way. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1384.6200000000001s)]
*  Ordinov does confess his feelings for Katarina and finally determines to kill Murin in order [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1388.8200000000002s)]
*  to free Katarina by force. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1393.18s)]
*  In the climactic scene, Ordinov is holding the knife and has the advantage over Murin. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1395.74s)]
*  But at the last moment, he breaks down into the old man's gaze, he drops the knife, and [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1401.9s)]
*  Katarina falls, weeping at Murin's feet. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1406.3000000000002s)]
*  When the police arrive, the old man tells them that the young woman requires a strong [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1410.96s)]
*  master like himself, and that Ordinov is no danger to anyone, given that he could not [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1414.8400000000001s)]
*  kill a stronger man even when he had every means to do so. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1420.6200000000001s)]
*  After Kosima Wagner, Nietzsche never made a move on another woman until 1876, many years [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1425.74s)]
*  later, after he began to publicly criticize Wagner's work and broke with the couple. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1431.62s)]
*  In that instance, he asked a friend to propose to the woman on his behalf, but she said no [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1437.5s)]
*  and ended up going off with his friend instead. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1443.8s)]
*  He went another six years before trying again and experienced a similar humiliation with [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1447.5s)]
*  a very close friend and the woman with whom he was smitten. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1452.5s)]
*  That one left a deep scar, but we'll talk about that a little later. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1456.7s)]
*  After Nietzsche read the Underground Spirit, he began writing to acquaintances to find [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1462.7s)]
*  out more about this Russian author and sought out every translation of Dostoevsky he could [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1467.26s)]
*  turn up. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1472.0800000000002s)]
*  As he worked through more of the Russian's work, he would find many more stories centered [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1473.8600000000001s)]
*  around love triangles. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1477.92s)]
*  The love triangle is, of course, a common device to generate literary conflict, but [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1480.04s)]
*  Few authors mastered the motif as completely as Dostoevsky. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1484.74s)]
*  What stands out in Dostoevsky's love triangles is that the protagonist of his stories turns [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1489.46s)]
*  out to be the loser in almost every case. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1495.22s)]
*  It's significant that all three women Nietzsche fell in love with over the course of his life [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1499.66s)]
*  were involved with somebody he knew. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1504.5s)]
*  The meat of his philosophy was all about the centrality of the will, about the emerging [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1507.34s)]
*  man of the future having the courage and the strength to shuck off the pull of the crowd [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1512.5s)]
*  and create his own values, never apologizing for his desires or his demands. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1516.54s)]
*  And yet, it's as if Nietzsche couldn't desire a woman on his own, not without his desire [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1523.02s)]
*  being validated by someone else. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1528.3400000000001s)]
*  In each case, he was the one who ended up alone, and in each case, he never really put [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1531.18s)]
*  up much of a fight. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1535.9s)]
*  There's a story from his time with the Wagner's that I think would have made a great scene [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1538.74s)]
*  in an early Dostoevsky novel. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1542.14s)]
*  In 1870, when Nietzsche was just starting out, Richard and Kassima Wagner invited him [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1544.6200000000001s)]
*  to spend Christmas with them, just the three of them, at Wagner's mansion in Lucerne. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1549.86s)]
*  Nietzsche had been drummed out of the Army Medical Corps due to illness, but they didn't [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1557.58s)]
*  care about that. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1561.26s)]
*  He had gone to serve, and so they welcomed him back as a hero. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1562.26s)]
*  But it's a little awkward. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1565.46s)]
*  Nietzsche loved Kassima and must have been disappointed when she and Wagner had been [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1567.34s)]
*  married just a few months before. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1571.5s)]
*  Not that it was a surprise or that anyone imagined any other outcome, but still. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1574.06s)]
*  Like Ordinov and the landlady, Nietzsche had gone to stay for a while with a woman he loved [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1579.86s)]
*  and the old man who held her enthrall. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1584.62s)]
*  Like Ordinov, he became very close with the woman but was never able to break into the [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1586.98s)]
*  circle reserved for her and her husband. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1590.5s)]
*  Like Ordinov, he was already having ambivalent feelings for the old man, and those feelings [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1593.6599999999999s)]
*  would grow darker over time. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1598.7399999999998s)]
*  And yet just as the old man, Murin, in the story could dominate Ordinov with a look, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1601.3799999999999s)]
*  for all Nietzsche the philosopher's warrior bravado, Wagner was still Wagner. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1606.3799999999999s)]
*  So when Nietzsche arrived for Christmas that year, his first time seeing Kassima since [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1615.5s)]
*  she'd married his rival, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1619.54s)]
*  Nietzsche brought gifts that can only make me think of a male animal who comes up short [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1622.3s)]
*  in a mating competition and makes cringing signs of submission to the dominant alpha. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1625.98s)]
*  To Wagner he gave an engraving by Durer called The Night, Death, and the Devil. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1632.06s)]
*  It had for many years been an important German nationalist rallying point, a symbol of German [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1638.0s)]
*  fierceness and courage and adversity. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1643.1399999999999s)]
*  It shows a German knight riding a horse through a corrupted land with skulls on the ground [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1645.86s)]
*  and monsters surrounding him. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1651.26s)]
*  Wagner loved it, of course, and understood Nietzsche's gift as depicting himself, Wagner, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1654.1s)]
*  riding the horse to save German culture from the foreign, mainly French and Jewish, influences [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1659.46s)]
*  that were corrupting it. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1665.86s)]
*  If you take Nietzsche at his later word, he was already filling with mounting disgust [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1668.18s)]
*  for exactly that kind of German chauvinism and becoming disillusioned with Wagner himself [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1671.86s)]
*  for indulging in it. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1677.58s)]
*  And yet, that's the gift that he got. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1679.52s)]
*  And his gift for Cosimo was arguably worse. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1683.24s)]
*  For her, he brought an early transcript of the book he was working on, which would become [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1686.56s)]
*  his first, The Birth of Tragedy. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1690.6s)]
*  In the book, he describes Greek tragedy as developing out of a musical base and says [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1694.12s)]
*  that the great age of Greek drama was the result of a synthesis between the non-rational, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1698.96s)]
*  musical impulse and the rational Apollonian narrative structure imposed on it, and that [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1704.84s)]
*  the two came into balance in the plays of Sophocles and Aeschylus before being thrown [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1710.28s)]
*  off kilter and eventually ruined by the overly critical influence of men like Socrates and [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1714.8799999999999s)]
*  Euripides. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1720.04s)]
*  He concludes by suggesting that after many centuries of dormancy, a new great age was [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1722.1599999999999s)]
*  now bringing up the curtain on the German fusion of music and drama, most significantly [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1729.66s)]
*  in the work of Richard Wagner, who was even as he wrote, said Nietzsche, pushing toward [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1734.68s)]
*  a similar peak as Aeschylus and Sophocles and all the great Greek tragedians. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1740.18s)]
*  Now perhaps I'm being too hard on Nietzsche here, but it seems like a guy with his ego [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1746.94s)]
*  and his ego was intergalactic, that if you're in love with another man's wife, a man who's [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1752.5s)]
*  kind of your patron, the alpha of your most significant social circle at least, you get [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1759.22s)]
*  invited to stay with them for Christmas, just months after they get married. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1765.42s)]
*  What do you get them for Christmas? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1768.68s)]
*  Maybe some flowers, a sequined angel for the top of the tree. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1770.7s)]
*  Given Nietzsche's negative feelings about German nationalism, getting Wagner that Dürer [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1776.38s)]

*  This is different than telling yourself, look, she's married, just forget about it, be cool, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1821.7s)]

*  After that Christmas, Nietzsche went back to teach at Basel and stayed in touch with [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1851.9s)]
*  the Wagner's. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1855.46s)]
*  He published The Birth of Tragedy in 1872, but although the Wagner's did their best to [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1856.82s)]
*  defend him, it got a terrible reception. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1861.42s)]
*  It didn't fit into any established categories, so other scholars didn't really know what [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1864.4s)]
*  to do with it. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1868.78s)]
*  A few hated it so much that some of his students' parents tried to have him run out of the university. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1870.22s)]
*  He was very bitter over this experience, and disenchanted with the field of philology, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1877.46s)]
*  which he was actually on the brink of leaving for a scientific field when he'd gotten the [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1882.5s)]
*  offer to teach at Basel. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1886.3s)]
*  So after his rapid initial rise into the company of the great at age 24, he sort of settled [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1888.78s)]
*  in as a rather conventional professor of philology, publishing a handful of essays and other pieces [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1895.34s)]
*  that nobody really considers among his important works, and nobody really read except his students. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1900.74s)]
*  Scholars and casual readers have long recognized that Dostoevsky's career can be cleanly divided [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1909.66s)]
*  into two parts, separated by a decade-long purgatory. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1914.18s)]
*  But it was Professor Girard who most clearly described the fundamental difference between [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1919.06s)]
*  pre-exilic and post-exilic Dostoevsky. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1923.26s)]
*  The tendencies that dominated his earlier career were already evident in his first book, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1927.26s)]
*  Poor Folk, which made him the next big thing in Russian literature at age 24, the same [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1932.42s)]
*  age as Nietzsche when he was made the youngest ever professor at Basel. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1937.94s)]
*  Like the landlady, Poor Folk centers around a love triangle in which the protagonist comes [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1942.06s)]
*  out the loser. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1946.7s)]
*  His name is Devushkin, and life is not great. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1948.3799999999999s)]
*  He's a low-ranking bureaucrat without much going for him. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1952.38s)]
*  He's poor, living in a room that's just a sectioned-off part of someone's kitchen. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1955.94s)]
*  People at work treat him badly, and the only light in his life comes from his correspondence [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1961.8200000000002s)]
*  with a woman down the street whose existence is equally miserable. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1966.2600000000002s)]
*  He's in love with her, but he never actually goes to see her in person for fear of creating [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1970.7s)]
*  a scandal. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1975.0200000000002s)]
*  Nevertheless, they become very close through the letters they write back and forth. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1976.7s)]
*  He gives her advice, buys her gifts with any extra money he manages to scrape together, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1981.3s)]
*  and makes himself an important part of her everyday routine through his letters. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1986.3s)]
*  But their correspondence is not the center of her life in quite the same way it is for [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1991.06s)]
*  him, and she eventually agrees to marry another man, an old man and a brute, but a rich old [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=1995.06s)]
*  brute, and by the time the novel ends, she has gone a long way toward becoming accustomed [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2001.58s)]
*  to her new status and lifestyle. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2006.3s)]
*  In her letters, she's already starting to speak casually about her new luxuries and [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2009.1s)]
*  privileges, and her responses to his letters become shorter and rarer. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2012.6999999999998s)]
*  He writes begging her to respond, and she writes back telling him, all is over, but [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2017.98s)]
*  even then leaves a drop of poison by asking him not to forget about her. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2023.62s)]
*  He writes back, finally, after all this time, to confess his love for her, but she never [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2028.58s)]
*  writes back, and that's the end of the story. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2034.34s)]
*  Yay! [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2037.9s)]
*  Anyone out there who's always heard about Dostoevsky but never gotten around to reading [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2038.9s)]
*  him, try to contain yourself from rushing off to the bookstore to get all his books. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2042.9s)]
*  We can detect a motif similar to that employed in The Landlady right from the beginning, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2048.82s)]
*  with a protagonist in a love triangle with a rival who is older, stronger, and more assertive, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2053.1s)]
*  and who in the end overpowers the protagonist and gets the girl that he wants. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2058.32s)]
*  In Poor Folk, as the woman's new relationship develops, she tells Devushkin that the man [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2062.82s)]
*  who had proposed to her is a tyrant and a brute, but what does he do? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2068.3s)]
*  He doesn't tell her to cancel the wedding immediately. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2073.6200000000003s)]
*  He doesn't confront the old bastard or make a gallant play to steal her away. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2076.42s)]
*  You'd like to say he didn't do anything, but it's actually worse than that. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2081.6200000000003s)]
*  Instead, he tries to make himself useful to the couple, helping to prepare the wedding [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2085.82s)]
*  between the woman he loves and this other man who he doesn't like, scurrying around [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2090.9s)]
*  looking for new humiliations as an excuse to remain in her orbit and signaling his non-threateningness [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2095.86s)]
*  to her fiancé so as not to be ordered out of the picture by him or by her. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2101.9s)]
*  Many of Dostoevsky's early works are a variation on this theme. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2109.06s)]
*  In A Weak Heart, the protagonist introduces his fiancé to his best friend, who promptly [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2112.86s)]
*  declares himself in love with her. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2118.04s)]
*  As the title implies, the protagonist does not have the heart to compete with his friend, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2120.38s)]
*  so he beats a retreat and instead asks his friend to make just a small place for him [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2124.86s)]
*  in their lives. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2129.02s)]
*  The plot of White Nights is practically a repetition of this exercise. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2131.1s)]
*  The desired woman has chosen another man and tells the protagonist, when we get married, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2135.78s)]
*  we will remain friends. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2140.7000000000003s)]
*  We will be as brother and sister or even something more. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2142.34s)]
*  I will love you almost as much as him. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2145.86s)]
*  Every man loves hearing that. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2149.34s)]
*  Again, the protagonist does everything he can to ensure the success of his rival, delivering [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2151.42s)]
*  letters and arranging rendezvous for the couple. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2157.86s)]
*  Throughout all of these stories, and this is really the key to understanding Dostoevsky's [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2161.6200000000003s)]
*  career, the weakness, fear, and indecision of the protagonist is always described in [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2167.1000000000004s)]
*  generosity and devotion and a spirit of self-sacrifice. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2175.3s)]
*  They might show how the beta behavior causes the protagonist to suffer, but it's the suffering [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2180.5s)]
*  of a martyr. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2186.82s)]
*  Their supposedly pure motives are just taken at face value, as if it isn't all a cover [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2188.94s)]
*  for a roiling ocean of resentment and humiliation, for being rejected in the most fundamental [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2194.1600000000003s)]
*  way that one can be rejected. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2199.6600000000003s)]
*  White Nights was the last story Dostoevsky wrote before the rupture in his career. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2203.54s)]
*  His time in the sun had lasted less than two years, and before long he had so offended [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2208.54s)]
*  the fickle critics of the Petersburg literary world that he was cast out and made an object [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2212.86s)]
*  of mockery and scorn. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2217.66s)]
*  He developed a terrible gambling addiction and fell in with a crowd of wannabe revolutionaries [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2220.14s)]
*  who'd orbited the literary scene. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2225.06s)]
*  Soon after White Nights was written, he and his friends were arrested and soon sentenced [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2227.9s)]
*  to death. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2232.26s)]
*  At the final moment, with the blindfold tied and firing squad in place, the Tsar commuted [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2234.0600000000004s)]
*  the sentence to four years of hard labor in Siberia. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2239.94s)]
*  And that was as miserable as it sounds. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2243.9s)]
*  About his barracks he wrote, quote, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2246.46s)]
*  In summer, intolerable closeness. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2248.82s)]
*  In winter, unendurable cold. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2251.44s)]
*  All the floors were rotten, filth on the floors an inch thick. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2253.98s)]
*  One could slip and fall. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2258.1200000000003s)]
*  We were packed like herrings in a barrel. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2259.9s)]
*  There was no room to turn around. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2261.88s)]
*  From dusk to dawn it was impossible not to behave like pigs, fleas, lice, and black beetles [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2263.84s)]
*  by the bushel. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2270.48s)]
*  There was to be no literature in prison. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2273.6s)]
*  For four years Dostoevsky had nothing to read but the New Testament. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2276.1600000000003s)]
*  And judgment was not finished with him after four years. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2280.6800000000003s)]
*  When his sentence was complete, he was conscripted into the army and sent to an outpost in the [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2283.76s)]
*  empty middle of the Russian Empire. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2288.6400000000003s)]
*  When he was young, Dostoevsky's father had sent him and his brother to a military academy [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2291.36s)]
*  to study engineering. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2299.1200000000003s)]
*  He hated it, and he hated his father for making him go, even as he was consumed with feelings [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2302.1200000000003s)]
*  of guilt and inadequacy and a sense of being a great disappointment to his father. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2307.4s)]
*  He fled from the life his father had prepared for him, to make his own way, taking up with [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2313.1200000000003s)]
*  a literary crowd who openly scorned men like his father, who had been a military doctor, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2317.92s)]
*  an ardent supporter of the Tsar, and a strong Orthodox Christian. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2324.14s)]
*  Well, just like Jonah, his flight had landed him right back at the place he had been trying [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2328.4s)]
*  to escape, in the army, now with no choice to leave, further than ever from everywhere. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2333.8s)]
*  And there he would remain in unproductive exile for another six years. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2340.38s)]
*  During that time, he got married after a romance that began with a love triangle and [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2345.56s)]
*  played out the themes of his early novels with such fidelity that it would be funny [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2349.42s)]
*  if it wasn't so tragic. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2353.44s)]
*  He was a terrible husband and an unfaithful husband, who gambled away money his family [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2355.74s)]
*  needed for food and shelter again and again, so that his poor wife had to work to pay the [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2361.04s)]
*  bills. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2366.2799999999997s)]
*  He even sold her jewelry and other possessions to pay his gambling debts. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2367.2799999999997s)]
*  So his experience in prison had not made him a saint overnight, not even close. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2372.7s)]
*  Prison was just the bucket of ice water thrown over his head to wake him up in the gutter. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2377.54s)]
*  But he was still in the gutter. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2381.62s)]
*  His first post-exilic book was The Insulted and Injured, which was more ambitious than [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2384.7999999999997s)]
*  any of his previous works and shows more insight into the true underground motives of characters [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2389.6s)]
*  whose actions are outwardly motivated by compassion and selflessness. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2395.1s)]
*  Professor Girard commented, quote, The obsessions that reappear in this novel, more pressing, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2400.1s)]
*  more worrying, more intolerable than ever. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2406.7799999999997s)]
*  With time, the structural lines of this obsession stand out and become more definite and simplify [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2410.74s)]
*  themselves like the features of a face in the hands of a caricaturist. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2415.42s)]
*  In all the writings of this period, Dostoevsky multiplies the obsessional situations and [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2420.04s)]
*  relief that it is nearly impossible to mistake their character. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2426.22s)]
*  All the characters of The Insulted and Injured take a painful pleasure, quite intense, at [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2430.54s)]
*  the spectacle of an amorous disaster to which they contributed their best collaboration, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2435.3399999999997s)]
*  end quote. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2440.74s)]
*  The characters hurt and betray one another or encourage the others to hurt and betray [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2442.6s)]
*  them. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2447.1s)]
*  They bathe in a sense of martyrdom and magnanimous self-sacrifice while wielding their forgiveness [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2448.1s)]
*  as a moral cudgel and taking sadistic pleasure in the groveling apologies of the ones who [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2453.7s)]
*  hurt them. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2458.54s)]
*  These characters don't dominate each other. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2460.48s)]
*  They manipulate and control through covert means. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2463.02s)]
*  The identity of every character and the source of all power they wield over each other is [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2466.54s)]
*  drawn from the insults and injuries they suffer and nurture, and each holds the others in [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2471.42s)]
*  thrall by their victimhood. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2477.02s)]
*  In this first post-exilic novel, Dostoevsky comes very close to facing the truth about [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2480.86s)]
*  himself and his characters, but unfortunately fumbles the ball at the goal line. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2485.9s)]
*  He still cannot admit the fact that this way of being must inevitably lead to disaster. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2491.1400000000003s)]
*  Instead, he tacks on an embarrassingly sentimental ending that has all the rivals who have been [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2496.78s)]
*  torturing each other throughout the book reconciled and redeemed without ever facing up to what [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2503.06s)]
*  they've been doing. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2508.06s)]
*  It's a pathetic and unsatisfying way to end the book, and it feels artificial, like Dostoevsky [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2509.74s)]
*  didn't believe in himself, and yet covers his doubt with layers of gratuitous emotion. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2514.8999999999996s)]
*  It's the work of a man whose lies to himself are wearing thin and whose fantasies for where [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2521.06s)]
*  his life is headed are no longer holding up. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2526.14s)]
*  In 1862, he published The House of the Dead, a novel based on his experiences in prison, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2530.1s)]
*  and that brought him back to the attention of the literary world. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2535.58s)]
*  His debts and continued gambling meant that this book's success didn't help their financial [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2539.54s)]
*  situation much. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2543.82s)]
*  In 1863, he traveled to Western Europe and started an affair with a younger woman there. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2545.94s)]
*  All the underground mechanisms, as Girard said, immediately kicked into gear. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2551.7799999999997s)]
*  At first, he was this older, wiser man, a writer of high esteem, and she was smitten [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2556.66s)]
*  with him even as he refused to divorce his wife, Maria, and played the part of the aloof [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2562.06s)]
*  one. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2566.9s)]
*  But then she fell for a young Spanish medical student, and Dostoevsky became insanely jealous [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2568.54s)]
*  and obsessive. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2573.7s)]
*  Suddenly he's possessed by this cosmic passion now that she's moving away from him. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2575.5s)]
*  And she did move away and go with the Spanish student. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2581.66s)]
*  Dostoevsky gambled and lost all the money he had while he was in France, and was forced [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2585.3s)]
*  to write to relatives to beg for money just to get home. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2590.14s)]
*  While he was on that trip, Maria, his wife, came down sick, and not long after he returned, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2594.46s)]
*  she died. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2600.12s)]
*  Very soon after, Dostoevsky's brother, Mikhail, to whom he was very close, also died, and [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2601.62s)]
*  he found himself the sole parent of Maria's son, his stepson, as well as the only responsible [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2607.66s)]
*  provider for his brother's family. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2613.42s)]
*  This moment in Dostoevsky's biography feels like a make or break moment. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2616.78s)]
*  The way Girard put it was, if Dostoevsky had simply gone mad in 1863, instead of starting [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2621.28s)]
*  to write notes from the underground, future critics, to the extent that they paid any [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2627.88s)]
*  attention to him at all, would have found clear premonitions of the rupture in his work [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2633.32s)]
*  up to that point. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2637.6800000000003s)]
*  Girard writes that, perhaps there was no other outcome for the Dostoevsky of 1863 than madness [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2639.8s)]
*  or genius. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2646.98s)]
*  Unfortunately for all of us, he chose genius. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2648.64s)]
*  His next book was Notes from the Underground, maybe my favorite novel, certainly the one [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2651.66s)]
*  I've read the most times. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2656.4s)]
*  If his earlier works were apologias for his underground personality and behavior, Notes [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2658.72s)]
*  reads more like a confessional. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2663.92s)]
*  He lays it out in all its sortedness, hides nothing, holds nothing back on account of [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2666.3599999999997s)]
*  his pride, and the result was his first masterpiece. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2671.6s)]
*  Pride alone doesn't necessarily transform bad habits overnight, and Dostoevsky still [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2677.32s)]
*  had work to do on himself. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2681.8s)]
*  His experience in prison and with Maria was just rock bottom. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2684.1200000000003s)]
*  It would be a few years before he climbed out of it, but the honesty and courage on [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2689.92s)]
*  display in Notes from the Underground and his subsequent works show that he was well [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2694.26s)]
*  on the path to redemption. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2697.84s)]
*  The famous line from Paradise Lost, that the mind is its own place and can make a heaven [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2701.0s)]
*  of hell and a hell of heaven, comes to mind when I think about this parallel period in [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2705.4s)]
*  the lives of Dostoevsky and Nietzsche. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2710.1600000000003s)]
*  By all appearances, Nietzsche's exile was certainly more comfortable than Dostoevsky's [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2712.84s)]
*  and not so traumatic. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2716.7200000000003s)]
*  Nine years as an unknown professor at a university in Switzerland certainly beats a decade in [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2718.6800000000003s)]
*  Siberia. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2723.32s)]
*  And yet Nietzsche was miserable, and increasingly so. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2724.32s)]
*  He wrote nothing of importance during what should have been the productive years of his [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2728.8s)]
*  life. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2732.7200000000003s)]
*  He felt trapped in a place without ever really remembering, making a firm decision to end [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2734.08s)]
*  up there. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2738.52s)]
*  But that describes much of Nietzsche's life. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2739.52s)]
*  Nietzsche lost his father when he was not quite five years old. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2743.92s)]
*  His father had been a Lutheran minister, appointed to his ministry by the king himself. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2747.2s)]
*  Both of Nietzsche's grandfathers had also been pastors, and it was expected that little [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2752.64s)]
*  Friedrich would take up the tradition when it was time. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2756.48s)]
*  As a boy, he seemed headed down that path. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2760.08s)]
*  His father wrote in a letter that little Friedrich, he calls him Fritz, is a wild [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2762.92s)]
*  boy who can sometimes be controlled only by his papa inasmuch as the rod is never far [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2768.44s)]
*  from him. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2773.76s)]
*  But now someone else helps more powerfully, and that is the dear Holy Christ, who has [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2775.08s)]
*  already taken hold of even little Fritz by head and heart so that he wants to hear and [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2780.52s)]
*  speak of nothing but the Holy Spirit. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2785.0s)]
*  It's something very sweet. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2787.6s)]
*  When Nietzsche was a little older, the other children called him little pastor because [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2791.12s)]
*  of his undeviating focus on his growing faith. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2795.2s)]
*  Dostoevsky, too, incidentally, was nicknamed Monk Fodius by his classmates for the same [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2798.7999999999997s)]
*  reason, after the orthodox Saint Fodius the Great. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2803.92s)]
*  Nietzsche's father was only 36 years old when he died very suddenly and unexpectedly. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2808.68s)]
*  I suppose when you're five years old, everything is sudden and unexpected. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2814.24s)]
*  Nietzsche was just old enough to be traumatized by his father's death, and his two younger [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2819.2s)]
*  siblings, a sister, three, and an infant brother, were too young to commiserate with. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2823.3199999999997s)]
*  Years later, when Nietzsche was 13, he wrote that he still could not quiet the sad sound [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2829.64s)]
*  of his father's funeral bells from ringing in his ears. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2834.7599999999998s)]
*  Well about six months after the funeral, little five-year-old Friedrich had a terrible dream, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2839.44s)]
*  which he shared with his mother the next morning and wrote down later, quote, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2844.68s)]
*  In the morning I tell the dream to my dear mother. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2874.7999999999997s)]
*  Soon after that, little Joseph, his baby brother, is suddenly taken ill. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2879.2799999999997s)]
*  He goes into convulsions and dies within hours, end quote. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2884.6s)]
*  So the very day after dreaming of his father coming up out of the grave to retrieve a baby [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2889.44s)]
*  boy, his infant brother dies in a horrible fashion. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2894.24s)]
*  And to make matters even more psychologically fraught, his father's body was then exhumed [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2898.9199999999996s)]
*  so that baby Joseph's body could be placed in his arms and the two buried together. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2903.92s)]
*  A touching gesture, perhaps, but I don't know how a five-year-old boy even begins to process that. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2909.1200000000003s)]
*  Nietzsche's mother moved him and his little sister in with his grandmother and two unmarried [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2916.1200000000003s)]
*  aunts from his father's side, and he was raised in a house with five women and no other boys [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2920.32s)]
*  or men save for the overpowering presence of his father's ghost. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2925.1800000000003s)]
*  Putting aside the gender politics of a household like that, it put a tremendous pressure on [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2930.04s)]
*  the boy. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2934.96s)]
*  His father had been a respected minister, patronized by the king. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2936.2400000000002s)]
*  He was a pillar of his community and his family. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2939.84s)]
*  Little Friedrich was his father's only son now that he'd taken little Joseph to the grave [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2943.02s)]
*  with him, and he was expected by the women in the house to take his father's place. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2947.12s)]
*  And to modern conceit, it's the things we don't choose that really make us who we are. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2954.3199999999997s)]
*  And Nietzsche's father represented, just as Dostoevsky's czarist, orthodox, military doctor [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2960.04s)]
*  father represented to him, all of those unchosen things against which both men emerged from [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2967.12s)]
*  adolescence in open rebellion. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2973.24s)]
*  Dostoevsky's rebellion led him to prison and a mock execution and thenceforth to redemption. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2975.72s)]
*  Once his mechanisms for self-deception had worn thin. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2982.56s)]
*  After notes, he published Crime and Punishment, followed by two novellas, and then The Idiot [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2986.2799999999997s)]
*  in 1869, another of his great books. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2991.24s)]
*  Dostoevsky died in 1881, still six years before Nietzsche would discover him. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=2995.48s)]
*  The year of Dostoevsky's death was the worst year of Nietzsche's life by his account. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3000.2799999999997s)]
*  Through most of the year, he was the same age his father had been when he suddenly died, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3005.24s)]
*  and Nietzsche's long-held suspicion that he'd follow his father into madness or early [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3009.56s)]
*  death was at the front of his mind. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3013.48s)]
*  His health had collapsed to the point where he couldn't even maintain a light teaching [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3016.24s)]
*  schedule and he was forced to retire from the university. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3020.0s)]
*  His daily suffering was such that he wrote, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3024.24s)]
*  I had 200 days of torment in the year. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3026.72s)]
*  My specialty was to endure extreme pain with perfect clarity for two or three consecutive [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3029.44s)]
*  days accompanied by constant vomiting. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3034.44s)]
*  Over the years, Nietzsche had become progressively alienated from most of his friends, his academic [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3038.8s)]
*  peers, and from people and society in general. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3043.5600000000004s)]
*  He had broken bitterly with the Wagner's, ostensibly over his disapproval of Wagner's [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3047.4s)]
*  presentation of Parsifal. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3051.7200000000003s)]
*  But more, but I think it was probably something a long time coming. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3054.2400000000002s)]
*  When he introduced his friend Paul Ray to Wagner, he had to embarrassingly ask Ray not [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3060.44s)]
*  to tell Wagner that he was Jewish for fear of Wagner's reaction. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3066.2s)]
*  Nietzsche's contempt for Wagner had festered for years. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3070.52s)]
*  He was about to enter his explosive period and he had to get out from under Richard Wagner [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3074.3599999999997s)]
*  before it could begin. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3079.4399999999996s)]
*  Their split left a scar on the soul of both men. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3081.48s)]
*  As I said, Nietzsche directly or indirectly criticizes Wagner in almost every one of the [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3084.9199999999996s)]
*  books he would publish in the 1880s, and Wagner was so upset that he would not allow Nietzsche's [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3088.8799999999997s)]
*  name to be spoken in his presence for the rest of his life. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3093.72s)]
*  After he quit teaching, Nietzsche's doctors ordered him to strictly limit his reading [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3098.52s)]
*  and writing to save what was left of his eyesight, and because it contributed to his worsening [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3103.16s)]
*  daily migraines. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3107.72s)]
*  But of course he ignored them. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3108.72s)]
*  When it became too difficult, he started working with an early typewriter so that he could [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3111.2s)]
*  close his eyes and write without vision. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3114.9199999999996s)]
*  He learned the keyboard and would close his eyes and type as colorful swirls and sparkles [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3117.8599999999997s)]
*  flashed behind his eyelids as the migraines fired off his synapses. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3122.88s)]
*  He told a friend that he saw a profusion of fantastic flowers twining around each other [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3127.76s)]
*  and constantly growing, changing in shape and color with exotic opulence. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3133.08s)]
*  With disturbing urgency in his soft voice, he asked, don't you think this is a symptom [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3137.94s)]
*  of incipient madness? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3143.38s)]
*  Nearly every day of the next ten years, Nietzsche was fighting through near blindness, near [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3146.68s)]
*  total exhaustion, extreme physical pain, overwhelming migraines, and taking frequent breaks for [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3151.46s)]
*  vomiting and diarrhea. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3158.3s)]
*  But Nietzsche was entering his great period. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3161.06s)]
*  Over the next decade, he would churn out a book a year, sometimes more, that are still [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3164.1800000000003s)]
*  read and taught today. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3167.9s)]
*  The same year he quit the university, he published Human, All Too Human, the first book of his [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3170.78s)]
*  great period. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3175.38s)]
*  The style was influenced by French writers, and he dedicated it to Voltaire, something [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3177.14s)]
*  many critics interpret as a deliberate thumb in the eye of Wagner, whose anti-French chauvinism [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3181.7799999999997s)]
*  was such that he refused to be addressed or to receive letters in the French language [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3186.7799999999997s)]
*  despite speaking it fluently, and who had specific contempt for Voltaire. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3191.62s)]
*  A section of the book grapples with some implications of Darwin's theory, which was now about 20 [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3197.3799999999997s)]
*  years old, and it swept the European intellectual world. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3202.42s)]
*  Nietzsche was influenced by Darwin's discoveries a great deal, both directly and in reaction [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3206.5s)]
*  against certain aspects of them. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3211.18s)]
*  Nietzsche would end up promoting social Darwinism of a certain type. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3214.18s)]
*  As the idea emerged and developed from the 1870s on, social Darwinism theorists focused [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3218.46s)]
*  on the health of a whole society. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3224.78s)]
*  The idea, basically, is that societies are subject to the same laws of natural selection [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3227.38s)]
*  organisms, and that we march ourselves willingly down the road to ruin when we interfere with [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3233.08s)]
*  that process. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3237.68s)]
*  Society should be a competition, and the losers of that competition should not be helped along [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3239.68s)]
*  but left behind. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3244.3199999999997s)]
*  They would say it might sound cruel, but science can't be cruel. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3246.16s)]
*  What would be cruel is allowing society to degenerate out of sentimentality, which would [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3250.7999999999997s)]
*  lead to suffering for everyone rather than just for the unfit. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3255.2s)]
*  Nietzsche would put a somewhat different spin on it. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3260.08s)]
*  He was never concerned with the general welfare. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3262.56s)]
*  For Nietzsche, the purpose of a society should be to produce great individuals, and the greatness [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3265.24s)]
*  of a society is measured by the greatness of the individuals it produces. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3270.74s)]
*  He doesn't mean the average individual in society A is better than the average individual [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3275.4s)]
*  in society B. Society B could consist of a population that is 98% degraded slaves, but [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3280.12s)]
*  if that other 2% is producing Caesars and Shakespeares and Napoleans, then that's the [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3287.56s)]
*  one to be preferred. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3292.44s)]
*  Nietzsche denounced pity as the morality of the slave, resentful of his, oh, I'm sorry. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3295.32s)]
*  Nietzsche denounced pity as the morality of a slave who's resentful of his slavery but [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3302.0s)]
*  too weak to be anything else, a subversive idea meant to cripple the strong by making [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3306.0s)]
*  them ashamed of their strength. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3311.6s)]
*  In a work a few years later, he began in the first lines by addressing his readers, of [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3314.16s)]
*  whom there were only a few dozen, mostly acquaintances who read his book out of politeness. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3318.8799999999997s)]
*  He said, let us look each other in the face. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3324.8199999999997s)]
*  We are hyperboreans. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3327.44s)]
*  We know well enough how remote our position is. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3330.08s)]
*  Neither by land nor water will you find the road to the hyperboreans. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3333.96s)]
*  Even Pindar in his day knew that much about us. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3337.72s)]
*  After the introduction, he shares his thoughts and these are the first lines of the book. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3341.44s)]
*  What is good? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3346.0s)]
*  Whatever arguments, whatever augments the feeling of power, the will to power, power [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3347.46s)]
*  itself in man. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3352.76s)]
*  What is evil? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3354.7000000000003s)]
*  Whatever springs from weakness. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3356.0s)]
*  What is happiness? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3358.2000000000003s)]
*  The feeling that power increases, that resistance is overcome. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3359.54s)]
*  Not contentment but more power, not peace at any price but war. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3364.04s)]
*  Not virtue but efficiency, virtue in the Renaissance sense, virtu, virtue free of moral [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3368.96s)]
*  acid. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3376.2s)]
*  The weak and the botched shall perish, first principle of our charity, and one should help [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3377.92s)]
*  them along to it. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3384.08s)]
*  What is more harmful than any vice? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3386.4s)]
*  Practical sympathy for the botched and the weak, Christianity. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3389.42s)]
*  She thwarts the whole law of evolution, which is the law of natural selection. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3394.68s)]
*  It preserves whatever is ripe for destruction. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3399.62s)]
*  It fights on the side of those disinherited and condemned by life. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3402.58s)]
*  By maintaining life in so many of the botched of all kinds, it gives life itself a gloomy [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3407.12s)]
*  and dubious aspect. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3413.24s)]
*  The problem that I said here is not what shall replace mankind in the order of living creatures. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3416.3399999999997s)]
*  Man is an end. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3421.34s)]
*  But what type of man must be bred, must be willed as being the most valuable, the most [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3422.6000000000004s)]
*  worthy of life, the most secure guarantee of the future? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3427.54s)]
*  This more valuable type has appeared often enough in the past, but always is a happy [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3432.04s)]
*  accident as an exception never as deliberately willed. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3436.2200000000003s)]
*  Very often it has been precisely the most feared. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3441.1800000000003s)]
*  Hitherto it has been almost the terror of terrors. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3444.3s)]
*  And out of that terror, the contrary type has been willed, cultivated, and attained. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3447.7s)]
*  The domestic animal, the herd animal, the sick, brute man, the Christian. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3452.7s)]
*  In 1881, he published Dawn or Daybreak. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3461.02s)]
*  In it he writes, medical kit for the soul. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3464.7999999999997s)]
*  What is the best healing application? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3467.7799999999997s)]
*  Victory. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3470.18s)]
*  In his notes that made up the will to power, he wrote, what is it we combat in Christianity [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3471.8999999999996s)]
*  that it wants to break the strong, that it wants to discourage their courage, exploit [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3477.58s)]
*  their bad hours and occasional wariness, convert their proud assurance into unease and distress [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3482.5s)]
*  of conscience, that it knows how to poison and sicken the noble instincts until their [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3487.7799999999997s)]
*  strength, their will to power turns backwards against itself, until the strong perish through [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3493.18s)]
*  orgies of self-contempt and self-abuse. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3498.54s)]
*  That gruesome way of perishing which Pascal provides the most famous example. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3501.94s)]
*  Is it unfair to point out that it was not Pascal but Nietzsche who soon went insane? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3508.26s)]
*  Lou Salome, who knew Nietzsche intimately for a time, wrote that, suffering and loneliness [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3513.7000000000003s)]
*  are the two great lines of fate in Nietzsche's biography, which become more pronounced the [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3519.4s)]
*  nearer one comes to the end. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3523.7400000000002s)]
*  Nietzsche had met Salome in 1882 through his friend Paul Ray, and she was the third and [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3526.7400000000002s)]
*  final woman with whom Friedrich Nietzsche would fall in love. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3531.58s)]
*  The first was Cosima Wagner, the second, I believe I mentioned, was in 1876, the year [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3535.2999999999997s)]
*  he broke with the Wagners. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3539.74s)]
*  She was 21 years old and apparently captivating. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3542.7599999999998s)]
*  In addition to Nietzsche and Ray, she is supposed to have entranced Sigmund Freud a few years [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3545.98s)]
*  later and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke sometime after that. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3550.06s)]
*  She had met Nietzsche's friend Paul Ray at a literary salon in Rome early in 1882, and [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3554.7999999999997s)]
*  Ray immediately fell in love and proposed to her. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3559.94s)]
*  She turned him down and instead suggested that the two live and study together as brother [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3563.42s)]
*  and sister. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3567.7400000000002s)]
*  She also suggested that they bring another man into the arrangement and start up a literary [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3569.94s)]
*  commune. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3574.3s)]
*  And so Ray introduces her to Nietzsche and he immediately falls in love with her as well. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3575.46s)]
*  She said she was interested, he asks Ray to propose to her on his behalf and Ray does [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3581.14s)]
*  this, but she rejects Nietzsche as well. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3588.46s)]
*  She said she was interested in him as a friend but not as a husband, but Nietzsche suppressed [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3590.98s)]
*  his disappointment and agreed to be the third man in their commune. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3595.2999999999997s)]
*  The three traveled around Switzerland and Italy making grand plans for their commune, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3599.7599999999998s)]
*  calling themselves the Holy Trinity and decided they would set it up in an abandoned monastery [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3604.22s)]
*  once they found one. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3608.66s)]
*  About a month after his initial proposal, Nietzsche proposed to Salome again, this time [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3611.18s)]
*  more earnestly and with better planning. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3615.42s)]
*  Yet again she rejected him and yet still Nietzsche stayed with them. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3619.02s)]
*  While passing through Lucerne, Switzerland, the town where he'd spent Christmas with [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3624.54s)]
*  Richard and Kostma Wagner, Nietzsche and the rest of the Holy Trinity stopped into a photographer's [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3628.26s)]
*  shop to have their picture taken together. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3633.26s)]
*  Salome told the men to stand by while she looked at the props in the photographer's [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3636.86s)]
*  studio and staged the picture herself. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3640.86s)]
*  When she was ready, they were called into the studio and it's a famous picture. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3643.82s)]
*  Salome is seated in the back of a two-wheeled cart holding a whip. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3648.2200000000003s)]
*  Ray and Nietzsche are in front of the cart with ropes around their arms, binding them [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3652.94s)]
*  to the wagon, pretending to be the horses she was whipping to pull her along. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3657.1400000000003s)]
*  The three summered near Nietzsche's mother and sister and they did not approve of Lou [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3668.6200000000003s)]
*  Salome. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3672.3s)]
*  She and Nietzsche spent a lot of time together, walking and talking and discussing plans, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3673.78s)]
*  Nietzsche trying to change her feelings for him. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3678.6200000000003s)]
*  But most of their time together was under the supervision of Nietzsche's sister, his [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3681.2200000000003s)]
*  younger sister, who insisted on acting as a chaperon. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3684.9s)]
*  Why did Nietzsche, a 38-year-old man, allow his little sister to act as his chaperon? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3689.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3694.42s)]
*  Why did he allow himself to be photographed as a whipped horse by a woman who'd twice [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3696.3s)]
*  rejected him, along with his friend whom she'd also rejected? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3700.34s)]
*  The answer to those questions might have something to do with why she rejected him. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3705.06s)]
*  In the fall of that year, Nietzsche proposed to Salome again and again she rejected him [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3709.7000000000003s)]
*  and now things were just getting awkward. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3713.86s)]
*  Ray and Salome ditched Nietzsche and Leipzig, leaving for Poland with no plans to meet up [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3716.38s)]
*  again. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3720.7000000000003s)]
*  Nietzsche sank into a deep depression. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3721.7000000000003s)]
*  He wrote letters to Ray, imploring, we will see each other again, won't we? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3725.1000000000004s)]
*  He was sad and he was bitter. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3730.26s)]
*  He blamed Ray for subverting his chances with Salome. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3732.3s)]
*  Then he blamed Salome herself and especially he blamed his sister. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3735.7400000000002s)]
*  He'd fallen out with his mother as well. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3740.26s)]
*  David Farrell Krell, an author and philosophy professor at DePaul, wrote a novel about Nietzsche [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3743.2200000000003s)]
*  that uses a lot of his real letters in notes as material in the text. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3748.3s)]
*  Those writings are used in their unaltered form to carry the reader through the events [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3753.6600000000003s)]
*  in his life and in between his commentary in the form of Nietzsche's own thoughts to [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3758.5s)]
*  himself. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3761.42s)]
*  Over the course of the novel, as Nietzsche suffers and experiences failure and frustration, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3762.94s)]
*  the voice of those thoughts becomes increasingly separate from the one they're directed toward. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3768.42s)]
*  His thoughts to himself take on a life of their own and turn on him and begin to attack [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3773.2200000000003s)]
*  him. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3777.54s)]
*  Quote, to take up with a woman half your age, a sordid Russian without morals. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3778.54s)]
*  Oh, I know, you're the grand immoralist, but she was probably already engaged to your common [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3784.26s)]
*  Israelite friend. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3788.9s)]
*  Didn't you think of infection, contamination, disease, invalidism, canker, blindness, prostration? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3790.3s)]
*  Didn't you think of the filth, the stench? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3796.26s)]
*  Didn't you think of your mother, boy? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3798.14s)]
*  You're a shame upon your family. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3800.86s)]
*  You have desecrated your father's grave. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3802.62s)]
*  God forgive you, I cannot. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3804.86s)]
*  She stood up to you in Berlin, served you right, kept you cooling your heels all day [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3807.26s)]
*  long in Grunwald, forlorn under dappled sunlight on the walking pass by the lake. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3811.24s)]
*  The next day you crept back home crestfallen, just like a little boy who lost his way. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3817.0s)]
*  End quote. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3821.72s)]
*  Now, this is followed by an actual letter that he wrote Paul Ray at the time. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3822.9599999999996s)]
*  To Paul Ray, Nomburg, Sunday, sunny weather. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3828.68s)]
*  In spite of everything, I am full of confidence in this year and its enigmatic toss of the [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3832.3199999999997s)]
*  dice for my fate. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3837.04s)]
*  I won't travel the Burkdisgaden and in general am no longer in any condition to undertake [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3838.72s)]
*  anything alone. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3844.2799999999997s)]
*  In Berlin I was like a lost penny, which I myself had dropped but thanks to my eyes couldn't [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3846.0s)]
*  find, although it lay right at my feet so that all the passers-by laughed at me. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3851.2s)]
*  Heartfelt greetings, your friend, N. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3857.12s)]
*  The year that all this was happening, 1882, Nietzsche published The Joyous Science. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3862.2799999999997s)]
*  In it he raises a question that would become central to his outlook. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3867.86s)]
*  What if some day or night, he asks, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3871.86s)]
*  loneliness and say to you, this life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3877.2200000000003s)]
*  to live once more and innumerable times more. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3883.02s)]
*  Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3887.06s)]
*  Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him, you were [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3892.1800000000003s)]
*  a god and never have I heard anything more divine. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3896.3s)]
*  Nietzsche wrote those lines during this period of intense frustration, humiliation and physical [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3900.94s)]
*  suffering. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3906.1800000000003s)]
*  He finished it in a deep depression. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3907.3s)]
*  In this state he's posing the question, how would you feel if you learned that life was [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3912.0600000000004s)]
*  an eternal recurrence, that you would reincarnate not as someone else but as yourself and not [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3916.6200000000003s)]
*  to make different choices but to go through the exact same life again and again so that [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3922.16s)]
*  every moment of your life, everything you do is not an ephemeral thing that happens [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3926.3999999999996s)]
*  once and fades away like a ripple on the ocean but instead everything, everything you do [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3931.04s)]
*  is set in stone for all eternity. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3936.3599999999997s)]
*  It is the life you will experience again and again forever. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3939.52s)]
*  How does a man answer that question when the two main lines in his life are, as Salome [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3944.16s)]
*  wrote about him, loneliness and suffering? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3948.56s)]
*  Nietzsche had some answers. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3951.68s)]
*  He wrote, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3954.04s)]
*  Now, the Nietzsche fans, when I bring up that point, scream at me that he's not talking [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3978.56s)]
*  about himself here and that's correct. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3989.88s)]
*  He would never admit that about himself. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3992.44s)]
*  He's talking about the botched and the weak, the losers, the people who resent their position [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=3994.4s)]
*  in life but are unable to do anything about it. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4000.04s)]
*  Well, what you hate in yourself, you hate when you see in other people. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4002.84s)]
*  One of the great insights into the narcissistic personality came from the psychologist Melanie [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4008.28s)]
*  Klein or at least came to me that way. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4012.76s)]
*  She describes how the narcissist is capable of short-lived outbursts of mania and depression [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4015.88s)]
*  but has trouble sustaining the intensity and quickly retreats into a feeling of numbness [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4021.0800000000004s)]
*  and deadness inside. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4025.2000000000003s)]
*  And the insight is that this is their way of defending against rage, a raging desire [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4027.6000000000004s)]
*  for revenge on the world that is refusing to give them what they need from it. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4033.2s)]
*  The rage feels overwhelming and so they suppress it and it takes tremendous psychological energy [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4038.8799999999997s)]
*  to suppress real rage and that just leaves them numb and exhausted and unable to generate [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4043.64s)]
*  enthusiasm for normal everyday things in life. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4048.8399999999997s)]
*  But revenge on who? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4055.72s)]
*  I'll try to wrap this up. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4056.72s)]
*  But revenge on who and how? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4058.3999999999996s)]
*  This is a man who participated in his own humiliation in that photographer's studio. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4061.08s)]
*  A man who can't stand up to his own little sister and instead writes of his hatred for [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4065.64s)]
*  her in notes and letters to other people. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4070.2799999999997s)]
*  His health had made him more or less an invalid. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4073.48s)]
*  He usually had very few friends or people close to him. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4076.24s)]
*  He never had a wife. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4079.36s)]
*  He never had a girlfriend. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4080.6s)]
*  He never had a woman, period, except for maybe a trip or two to a brothel. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4083.0s)]
*  All three of the women he ever loved in his life chose a rival over him. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4088.16s)]
*  He published books that nobody read and those who did read them weren't overly impressed. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4092.3999999999996s)]
*  Even to the end of his life, he never got out from under a cloud of narcissistic abuse [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4098.62s)]
*  from his mother and sister. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4102.44s)]
*  After his split with Ray and Salome for which he blamed his sister, he wrote in a letter, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4104.68s)]
*  there was a real hatred of my sister who has cheated me of my best acts of self conquest [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4108.48s)]
*  for a whole year so that I have finally become the victim of a relentless desire for vengeance. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4113.64s)]
*  Precisely when my inmost thinking has renounced all schemes of vengeance and punishment. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4119.6s)]
*  This conflict is bringing me step by step closer to madness. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4124.400000000001s)]
*  I feel this in the most frightening way. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4128.4400000000005s)]
*  Strange thing to write about your little sister. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4132.12s)]
*  That place Dostoevsky called the underground. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4135.0s)]
*  Nietzsche had another name for it, pulling from a French concept passing around at the [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4137.52s)]
*  time, Ressentiment. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4141.72s)]
*  Only he never would have attributed that attitude to himself. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4142.72s)]
*  Ressentiment is like resentment but more specific and there are more layers to it. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4147.6s)]
*  To keep it simple, it is the state of a person in an inferior position who wishes revenge [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4152.28s)]
*  on those above him that lacks either the will or the ability to take that revenge. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4156.92s)]
*  This state, resenting your inferiority, objecting to it in principle but unable to disprove [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4162.16s)]
*  it in reality without recourse, the soul rots in this condition, Nietzsche says, and [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4168.0s)]
*  begins to seek other ways to find revenge. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4174.36s)]
*  So again, revenge on who? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4178.68s)]
*  Well start close and work your way out. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4182.36s)]
*  The most famous passage in the Joy of Science is the rant of a madman proclaiming that God [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4185.08s)]
*  is dead. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4189.44s)]
*  A tremendous thing for the son of a pastor and the grandson of two pastors and one who [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4190.44s)]
*  grew up known as the little pastor himself to write. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4195.5199999999995s)]
*  His deeply religious mother, who had always been upset by Nietzsche's decision not to [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4199.719999999999s)]
*  become a minister like his dad, read the passage and told her son to his face that he was a [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4203.639999999999s)]
*  disgrace to his father's grave. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4208.799999999999s)]
*  A long time afterward Nietzsche wrote that he had not for one instant been able to get [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4211.879999999999s)]
*  the sound of her voice saying those words out of his mind but then he must have known [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4216.799999999999s)]
*  what her reaction would be. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4222.36s)]
*  He begins mounting increasingly grandiose and vitriolic attacks on specifically those [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4225.08s)]
*  things that were valued and admired in his past. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4229.84s)]
*  His work becomes increasingly hostile, even hateful toward Christianity, and he hammers [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4233.5599999999995s)]
*  home his contempt for Wagner with screeds against Germany and the German people. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4238.32s)]
*  He called German stupid, cultureless, vulgar, tasteless, the spoilers of Europe, and extolled [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4243.18s)]
*  the virtues of the French and the Jews, for whom his appreciation was sincere enough, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4249.08s)]
*  but it's the way he belabors the point that betrays his motive. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4254.8s)]
*  He attacks Arthur Schopenhauer, one of his early philosophical influences, as well as [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4258.28s)]
*  Wagner's. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4262.68s)]
*  He attacks Kant and Hegel and says that polluted blood makes it all but impossible for a German [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4263.68s)]
*  to create anything of value. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4269.320000000001s)]
*  He even invents a genealogy for himself that made him a descendant of Poles so as to free [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4271.72s)]
*  himself from his German heritage. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4276.56s)]
*  Contrast this to Dostoevsky. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4280.400000000001s)]
*  Like Nietzsche, Dostoevsky had set out rebellion against his origins, against everything a [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4282.38s)]
*  powerful father still represents to an immature son. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4286.86s)]
*  Unmoored, Nietzsche drifted around Europe looking for a climate that might help ease [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4293.54s)]
*  his mounting illness. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4297.900000000001s)]
*  Alienated from his family, with Ray and Salome gone, depressed, in pain, and increasingly [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4299.74s)]
*  taking heavy doses of opium and other drugs to get through the day. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4305.4400000000005s)]
*  In 1883, he applies for a minor teaching post at the University of Leipzig, where he had [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4309.7s)]
*  previously impressed his professors so much that they waved his doctoral requirements [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4315.38s)]
*  to give him an early start on his academic career. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4319.66s)]
*  But they didn't want him. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4322.0599999999995s)]
*  The same year, he managed to publish the first part of the book he considered to be his most [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4324.78s)]
*  important, The Spagues Zarathustra. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4329.82s)]
*  He begins that book with a sort of invocation, setting the scene with his character Zarathustra, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4334.36s)]
*  who speaks for Nietzsche himself, descending to share his wisdom with benighted man. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4338.82s)]
*  When he encounters man, he takes his place and announces, I teach you the Ubermensch. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4344.179999999999s)]
*  Ubermensch means overman or superman. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4349.94s)]
*  It doesn't mean a man with superpowers, but the being that will supersede man, as man [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4352.44s)]
*  superseded the apes. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4356.66s)]
*  Zarathustra proceeds through many speeches to tell people how to follow him on the road [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4358.94s)]
*  to superhumanity. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4365.38s)]
*  Nietzsche published the book in parts over the next few years. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4367.7s)]
*  In 1885, he published part four and only printed 40 copies, most of which were distributed [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4370.54s)]
*  to acquaintances by Nietzsche himself and may have even been read by some of them. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4376.42s)]
*  Well, what's a man to do in this situation? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4381.34s)]
*  What do you do when you're a half-blind, hobbled, sickly man who believes that the weak and [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4384.94s)]
*  the botched should perish and in fact should be helped along their way? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4390.06s)]
*  When you preach victory is the only good medicine for the soul and of the soul-rotting [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4395.52s)]
*  effects of continual defeat and frustration and yet you have no victories. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4399.76s)]
*  When you think the world is one way, but all the evidence of your senses tells you something [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4405.02s)]
*  else. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4409.080000000001s)]
*  Nietzsche and Dostoevsky represent two answers to these questions, namely that you can surrender [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4410.080000000001s)]
*  or you can fight on to the bitter end, whether the cause is lost or not. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4416.0s)]
*  Dostoevsky still had one foot in the underground after emerging from prison. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4420.52s)]
*  His gambling habit continued to plague everyone around him. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4425.4s)]
*  He wrote a novella called The Gambler to pay off debts he'd incurred by gambling and during [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4428.94s)]
*  the course of the writing he fell in love with a stenographer to whom he dictated it. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4432.96s)]
*  They were married, had children, and Dostoevsky seemed to be pulling himself together. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4437.5199999999995s)]
*  And then in 1871 he lost gambling again and they had to sell all of their possessions. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4442.2s)]
*  And who can really say why people do what they do? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4448.339999999999s)]
*  Who knows why this time was different, but it was. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4450.94s)]
*  He promised his wife he was done and that was it. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4454.52s)]
*  He was done. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4456.84s)]
*  The next year he wrote a masterpiece called Demons or Devils or the Possessed that drew [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4458.52s)]
*  on his experience with the political radicals that got him thrown into prison. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4464.120000000001s)]
*  He started up a literary journal, started making some money for the family, and by now [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4468.360000000001s)]
*  Russians were reading Dostoevsky and starting to realize that they had something special [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4472.6s)]
*  on their hands. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4477.96s)]
*  He went abroad for a while on doctor's orders to recuperate from an illness. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4480.040000000001s)]
*  And when he returned the Tsar of Russia invited Fyodor Dostoevsky, who had previously been [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4484.0s)]
*  set for execution on account of his sedition. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4489.9800000000005s)]
*  He was invited to the Russian court and asked by the Tsar to educate the Tsar's own sons. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4496.96s)]
*  In the 1870s he accepted an invitation to serve as president of the board for the all [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4504.76s)]
*  Slavic Benevolent Association and he wrote lyrically about the Russian people and the [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4508.84s)]
*  Orthodox faith. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4513.24s)]
*  As his health failed in 1880 and 1881 he pulled together his strength and wrote the Brothers [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4515.28s)]
*  Karamazov, a historic masterpiece at the top of many lists as the greatest novel ever written. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4520.12s)]
*  I doubt it's out of anyone's top five. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4526.6s)]
*  When Dostoevsky died in 1881 he was a recognized master of letters, but he had also become [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4530.24s)]
*  a man, a husband and a beloved father whose widow and children revered his memory, a proud [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4535.86s)]
*  Russian and a man of whom Russians were proud, and an Orthodox Christian who had found his [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4542.259999999999s)]
*  way back from the wilderness. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4547.98s)]
*  A whole people grieved when he passed. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4550.82s)]
*  His funeral procession was said to have been the largest in Russian history up to that [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4553.42s)]
*  point. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4556.94s)]
*  I forgive you guys if you want to go, it's okay. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4559.179999999999s)]
*  I just have a few more minutes. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4560.94s)]
*  On his deathbed, when he knew the end was very close, Dostoevsky asked for his children [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4564.54s)]
*  to be brought in one final time. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4568.82s)]
*  He knew it was the final time, that was his decision, and he knew this experience would [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4571.38s)]
*  stick with his children and he had considered what he wanted to leave them with. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4575.42s)]
*  Now this was an educated, eloquent, widely read man who could have drawn from a deep [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4580.98s)]
*  well to make his final message count. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4585.1s)]
*  When his children were in the room with him he asked that the parable of the prodigal [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4587.94s)]
*  son be read to them in his dying presence. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4592.5s)]
*  And Jesus said there was a man who had two sons. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4595.54s)]
*  The younger son said to his father, father, give me a portion of the inheritance that [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4598.74s)]
*  I might put it to use. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4602.38s)]
*  And his father therefore gave him his portion. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4604.42s)]
*  The younger son took his inheritance and departed for a far country and there wasted his father's [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4607.22s)]
*  gift on riotous and dissolute living. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4612.18s)]
*  When he had spent it all, the terrible famine set upon the land and he had no food. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4615.66s)]
*  Therefore he hired himself to a citizen of that foreign land who sent the younger son [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4620.46s)]
*  into his fields to feed swine. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4624.5s)]
*  Yet still no citizen of that land would give unto him until he fell before the trough and [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4627.7s)]
*  shared husks with the swine. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4633.86s)]
*  And in this lowly state he said to himself, even the hired servants of my father have [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4636.9s)]
*  bred despair, yet here I perish in hunger. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4641.86s)]
*  I will arise and go to my father and say unto him, father, I have sinned against heaven [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4645.62s)]
*  and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4650.9s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4654.9s)]
*  No, it's okay. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4657.9s)]
*  Only make me one of thy hired servants. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4661.14s)]
*  And he arose and came to his father, but he was seen while yet far way off and his father [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4664.14s)]
*  was overjoyed and embraced his son and kissed him. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4669.46s)]
*  His son said, father, I have betrayed heaven and thee and I am not worthy to be called [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4672.44s)]
*  thy son. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4676.04s)]
*  But his father turned to his servants and said, bring forth my best robe and put it [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4677.04s)]
*  on my son. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4680.879999999999s)]
*  Put a ring on his hand and bring shoes for his feet. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4681.879999999999s)]
*  Bring hither the fattened calf and prepare for a feast. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4685.04s)]
*  Tonight we celebrate. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4688.679999999999s)]
*  For this my son was dead and he's returned to us alive. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4690.2s)]
*  He was lost and has been found. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4694.2s)]
*  And so they celebrated. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4695.5599999999995s)]
*  Now his older son was in the field and as he returned from his duties he heard music [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4697.759999999999s)]
*  and revelry. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4701.88s)]
*  He called to a servant and asked what was the meaning of it all and the servant said, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4703.52s)]
*  thy brother has come and thy father has killed the fattened calf for the joy of finding [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4706.88s)]
*  him safe and sound. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4711.04s)]
*  The older brother was angry, refused to go in. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4713.0s)]
*  Therefore came his father, his father came out and pleaded with him and he answering [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4717.2s)]
*  said to his father, father, all these years I have served thee. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4721.4800000000005s)]
*  Neither transgressed I at any time thy commandments. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4725.96s)]
*  Yet thou never gaveest me a feast or make merry on my behalf. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4729.04s)]
*  But as soon as this thy younger son is come which has devoured his inheritance with harlots, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4733.28s)]
*  thou hast killed for him the fattened calf. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4738.6s)]
*  And his father said unto him, my son thou art always with me and all that I have belongs [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4741.8s)]
*  to you. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4747.22s)]
*  Therefore let us celebrate together for your brother who was dead is now alive and who [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4748.58s)]
*  was lost to us. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4754.48s)]
*  I have been reading that story my whole life and I can't fail to get emotional every time [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4755.48s)]
*  I do it. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4763.639999999999s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4764.639999999999s)]
*  Of this episode, Dostoevsky biographer Joseph Frank wrote, it was this parable of transgression, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4765.639999999999s)]
*  repentance and forgiveness that he wished to leave as a last heritage to his children [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4771.4s)]
*  and it may well be seen as his own ultimate understanding of the meaning of his life and [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4775.5199999999995s)]
*  the message of his work. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4779.719999999999s)]
*  Dostoevsky had left his father's house literally and figuratively and then he realized that [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4782.04s)]
*  forsaking his home did not make him free. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4787.36s)]
*  It just made him homeless. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4790.44s)]
*  He didn't want the responsibilities of a son and so instead he ended up as a slave. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4792.5199999999995s)]
*  And when he hit rock bottom he went back humbled to all the things he'd left, his family, his [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4798.5199999999995s)]
*  country, his people and his faith and instead of rejecting him they celebrated that one [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4804.8s)]
*  of their sons has come home. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4810.2s)]
*  All right, we're literally almost done. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4812.639999999999s)]
*  You guys are very kind, thank you. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4817.28s)]
*  By the summer and fall of 1888 Nietzsche's behavior was becoming erratic. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4819.8s)]
*  His landlord reported hearing him talk to himself loudly in his room. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4823.76s)]
*  Once he was caught shredding currency and throwing it in his waste paper basket and [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4828.04s)]
*  he demanded that the paintings be removed from his room in order to make it more resemble [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4831.5599999999995s)]
*  a temple, a home for a god like himself. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4835.0199999999995s)]
*  He told people in person that he had arrived to take the place of God now that the old [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4838.46s)]
*  one had gone away. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4842.78s)]
*  He approached strangers on the street and asked them what they thought of his creation. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4844.58s)]
*  In Nietzsche's last stretch of sanity in late 1888 and early 1889 he wrote and spoke frequently [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4849.14s)]
*  of coincidences he'd been experiencing and of the feeling that fate was now drawing him [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4855.16s)]
*  on. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4860.02s)]
*  To a friend he wrote that there is no longer any element of chance in my life. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4861.32s)]
*  To another he wrote nothing happens by chance anymore. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4865.38s)]
*  In the closing words of his autobiography which he wrote in his last ten weeks of sanity, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4869.18s)]
*  he wrote that the formula for greatness in human life was to learn to love one's fate. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4875.06s)]
*  Nine days after he wrote nothing happens by chance, I swear, five more minutes, Nietzsche [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4880.900000000001s)]
*  was out walking the streets of Turin, Italy when the friend with whom he'd been staying [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4889.34s)]
*  was called to retrieve him. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4893.1s)]
*  He found Nietzsche on the ground surrounded by a gawking crowd and some policeman weeping [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4895.1s)]
*  with his arms thrown around the neck of a horse. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4900.780000000001s)]
*  It's his friend we have these details from. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4904.1s)]
*  A policeman told him that Nietzsche had seen a man beating a horse and he ran and threw [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4906.620000000001s)]
*  his arms around the horse to protect it from further blows and then collapsed hysterical [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4915.1s)]
*  and weeping. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4920.14s)]
*  It was a scene reminiscent of the most famous scene from Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4921.740000000001s)]
*  in which a mob beats a tired old cart horse to death as the protagonist, a child, tries [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4926.02s)]
*  in vain to protect it from their wrath. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4931.58s)]
*  It was a scene that affects everyone who reads it and one which Nietzsche copied into his [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4934.54s)]
*  notebooks verbatim over and over again. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4938.46s)]
*  Friedrich Nietzsche went insane that day and never came back. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4942.62s)]
*  The next day after he'd been brought back and put to bed he wrote a note, sing me a [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4946.18s)]
*  new song, the world is transfigured and all the heavens are full of joy and he signed [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4951.3s)]
*  it the crucified. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4956.66s)]
*  A few days later, perhaps for the first and only time, he wrote a letter to Cosima Wagner [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4959.02s)]
*  to express his love. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4964.42s)]
*  It read, Ariadne, I love you, Dionysus. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4966.22s)]
*  He signed all letters he wrote from then on as either the crucified or Dionysus. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4971.56s)]
*  Having associated madness with the death of God in his writings, he identified himself [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4977.0s)]
*  as a God who had been killed after he himself went mad. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4981.400000000001s)]
*  At times he would fall into spells where he would simply repeat the same phrases over [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4985.26s)]
*  and over, I am dead because I am stupid, I am stupid because I am dead, or I have a fine [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4988.88s)]
*  feeling for things, or I do not like horses. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4994.68s)]
*  Nietzsche knew that he was fighting a lost cause. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=4999.32s)]
*  In his autobiography he wrote, I attack only causes that are victorious. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5002.08s)]
*  I attack only causes against which I cannot expect to find allies. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5006.36s)]
*  I attack only causes against which I shall stand alone. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5010.24s)]
*  Maybe that would be an interesting variation on the parable of the prodigal son and we'll [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5016.0199999999995s)]
*  wrap it up. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5019.92s)]
*  If there were two prodigal sons traveling together, living it up and ending by eating [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5020.92s)]
*  together with the pigs. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5026.84s)]
*  When one of the two has an awakening and says, look, we've been foolish and arrogant, why [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5029.52s)]
*  did we think we knew better than our fathers, than our big brother, everyone we grew up [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5034.28s)]
*  with? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5039.04s)]
*  Enough, let's go home. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5040.04s)]
*  They'll take us back. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5042.84s)]
*  The other son pulls his head out of the pig trough. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5045.4800000000005s)]
*  He's covered in slop and sores and no longer even notices the flies on his face. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5049.08s)]
*  But underneath the filth is an unmistakable look of contempt for his friend who's been [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5054.2s)]
*  broken by his conditions and wants to go home. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5058.599999999999s)]
*  His humbled friend says, don't you understand what will happen if we continue this way? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5062.4s)]
*  And for what? [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5066.4s)]
*  Our families will welcome us. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5067.5599999999995s)]
*  They'll be overjoyed when we return. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5068.92s)]
*  And the other says, I know perfectly well where my path leads. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5072.2s)]
*  And I know they'd throw a feast if I returned. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5076.04s)]
*  Now go back to your daddy, coward. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5078.2s)]
*  The thing is, all humans break. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5082.28s)]
*  That's what it means to be human. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5085.2s)]
*  The difference between humans and gods is that gods can break humans. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5087.08s)]
*  The meaning of our various hell myths, whether we mean hell or the misery of Job or the wasteland [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5092.08s)]
*  of the prodigal son or the eagle plucking out the liver of Prometheus or Sisyphus with [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5097.96s)]
*  his rock, is that if you go up against final things, you will lose. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5103.32s)]
*  One day in 1889, Nietzsche's war ended in defeat, just as Dostoevsky's did. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5110.2s)]
*  But they both achieved glory in their own way. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5119.0s)]
*  Nietzsche's greatness lies not in the fact that he was right, but that he paid his bill [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5121.48s)]
*  down to the last cent for being wrong. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5126.24s)]
*  And there is greatness in that too. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5129.679999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much, guys. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5132.08s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5133.08s)]
*  You guys are very generous with your time. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5134.08s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5140.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5141.36s)]
*  And I am sorry. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5142.36s)]
*  Hopefully, I didn't interfere with your lunch too much. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq0cofYKSIs&t=5143.36s)]
