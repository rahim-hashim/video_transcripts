This series deals with some very dark material. It is not for listening with kids in the car or where other people can hear it at work.

# The Complete Jeffrey Epstein Series
**Martyr Made:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o)
*  I'm content to die for my beliefs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=0.0s)]
*  So cut off my head and make me a martyr. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6.0s)]
*  The people will always remember it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13.0s)]
*  No, they will forget. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17.0s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=22.0s)]
*  God is a thought. God is an idea. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=25.0s)]
*  It is a place. It is somewhere. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=29.0s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=34.0s)]
*  But its reference is to something that transcends all things. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=37.0s)]
*  I must tear ourselves apart for this small question of religion. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=46.0s)]
*  Part One [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=56.0s)]
*  Alright, look. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=59.0s)]
*  I know that none of us trust or expect much of our governments these days. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=61.0s)]
*  That probably applies no matter what country you live in. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=69.0s)]
*  But I don't think I'm really asking for a lot here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=74.0s)]
*  I'm not going to demand that politicians stop lying or that they stop taking bribes that are dressed up to look like book advances or speaking fees. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=78.0s)]
*  I'm not asking that their family members stop accepting bribes on their behalf. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=88.0s)]
*  I don't like any of that, but again, I've learned to moderate my hopes for how far from rock bottom these people are capable of climbing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=93.0s)]
*  In fact, I'm at the point where I don't even care about the bribes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=102.0s)]
*  Yeah, they can keep them. They can keep the bribes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=106.0s)]
*  If I can just make a couple requests. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=109.0s)]
*  Like, for example, next time that scientists have questions about how an infectious disease like, I don't know, how about syphilis develops over time in a human host, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=113.0s)]
*  maybe we should not give the disease to a bunch of black people and then lie about giving them treatments for decades so that we can watch as the disease slowly destroys their minds and bodies. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=126.0s)]
*  Maybe we should not do that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=137.0s)]
*  Again, I'm asking for the bare minimum here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=140.0s)]
*  Or maybe next time a reclusive religious congregation with a weirdo leader comes onto the radar of one of your agencies. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=143.0s)]
*  How about you arrest the guy while he's out on his morning jog, which he goes on predictably every day instead of sending Delta Force to Waco, Texas to oversee the massacre of the entire group? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=153.0s)]
*  How about that? It's not a huge ask. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=162.0s)]
*  Or if you want, and I know I'm starting to get multiple with my requests here. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=166.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm pushing my luck. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=171.0s)]
*  But maybe if you want to send a bunch of us to war in a foreign country, can it please be for reasons that are not completely made up? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=172.0s)]
*  Or here's another one. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=181.0s)]
*  When our intelligence agencies go about their mission of gathering and analyzing information and carrying out covert operations, you know, we understand we're understanding people. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=184.0s)]
*  We get it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=195.0s)]
*  Sometimes things can get a little messy, a little morally complicated. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=196.0s)]
*  But what if? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=200.0s)]
*  What if next time one of your agents suggests working with a guy who's engaged in large scale trafficking of children for sex, maybe someone in your organization says that we should probably not do that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=202.0s)]
*  Or is that too much? I know I made a lot of requests. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=218.0s)]
*  Look, I'll compromise on the first three. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=220.0s)]
*  OK, give people diseases, massacre American citizens, you know, launch wars on false pretenses, you know, whatever. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=222.0s)]
*  But is it too much to ask that if a federal prosecutor overseeing the investigation of a serial pedophile and child trafficker says on the record that he was told to back off by his superiors because the guy, quote, belongs to intelligence? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=229.0s)]
*  Is it too much to ask that just one reporter in all the newsrooms in America would stick a microphone in this guy's face and ask him exactly what the fuck he meant by that? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=247.0s)]
*  Anyone? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=259.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, of course, I'm talking about Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=261.0s)]
*  It's, you know, it's a situation that seems almost too horrible to be plausible, right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=268.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure, Intel agencies might have to skirt a bit of bourgeois morality here and there to do their jobs. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=276.0s)]
*  But surely every agent of the CIA or FBI would resign in protest if they found out the agency was helping a mass pedophile avoid prosecution, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=284.0s)]
*  I can say with certainty, with zero doubt that any one of my 12 closest friends or relatives, if they were in that position, would not keep quiet about it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=297.0s)]
*  I have no doubt about that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=309.0s)]
*  And so it sounds reasonable to us, to regular people, you know, what kind of people would hear that and just and just move on like, huh, what's that boss? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=312.0s)]
*  The mass child sex trafficker has a relationship with intelligence agencies and I should let him go, agree not to prosecute any of his accomplices, even ones that turn up later that we don't know about for crimes we don't know about yet. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=320.0s)]
*  Hey, sure, boss, you got it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=332.0s)]
*  Like, I can say that I don't know anybody who would do that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=334.0s)]
*  And I'll bet you can say the same about most of the people close to you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=339.0s)]
*  And so it just makes sense to regular people with an average understanding of ethics that there's no way the agencies would do that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=343.0s)]
*  Until you remember that no one in those agencies apparently had a problem working with South American drug lords right as the crack epidemic was consuming American inner cities. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=353.0s)]
*  And that no one seems to have spoken up when the decision was made to place us into an effective alliance with Al Qaeda in Syria and Yemen barely a decade after 9-11. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=365.0s)]
*  You ever remember being asked about that? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=377.0s)]
*  Remember being asked if we wanted to fight on the same side as Al Qaeda in Syria and Yemen? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=379.0s)]
*  Because I don't. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=384.0s)]
*  But that's not the kind of question that it occurs to a normal person to ask because a normal person thinks there's no way our government would put us into an alliance with Al Qaeda before the new World Trade Center was even finished rebuilding. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=386.0s)]
*  But they did. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=401.0s)]
*  Or how about Afghanistan? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=404.0s)]
*  Remember when an army captain beat up an Afghanistan army officer that he found raping a little boy? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=406.0s)]
*  He got in trouble with that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=411.0s)]
*  He got kicked out of the army. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=412.0s)]
*  And the rest of our troops got instructions that they were not to intervene in similar circumstances. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=414.0s)]
*  Do not intervene if you encounter child rape because Bacha Bazi, the recreational abuse of young boys, was just a cultural difference that they were going to have to get over, learn to be tolerant about. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=420.0s)]
*  And then come to find out, surprise surprise, sexual abuse of young boys by our allies in the Afghanistan security forces was pervasive throughout our occupation of the country. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=433.0s)]
*  Quote, horrifying abuse at checkpoints makes the boys, many unpaid and unregistered, hungry for revenge and easy prey for Taliban recruitment, often because there is no other escape from exploitative Afghan security force commanders. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=445.0s)]
*  Practically all of Aruzgan's 370 local and national police checkpoints have Bacha's. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=462.0s)]
*  Those are little boys, some up to four who are illegally recruited not only for sexual companionship, but also to bear arms. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=469.0s)]
*  Again, these are little boys. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=476.0s)]
*  Some policemen, they said, demand Bacha's like a perk of the job, refusing to join checkpoints where they are not available. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=479.0s)]
*  End quote. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=486.0s)]
*  The Taliban had banned that practice in 1996 and kept the ban in place until the invasion of 2001 when we took over and the ban was no longer enforced. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=487.0s)]
*  So the Taliban started reaching out to these boys who were being kept as sex slaves by our allies, by the Afghanistan security forces and saying to them, hey, help us. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=499.0s)]
*  Kill your guards if you can and run away. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=511.0s)]
*  Come to us. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=513.0s)]
*  We'll take you in. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=514.0s)]
*  That's a pretty easy sell. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=515.0s)]
*  And so we got instances like this. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=517.0s)]
*  Quote. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=520.0s)]
*  He said the attacker says a boy, a little boy who ended up attacking the police officers, Afghanistan police officers. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=521.0s)]
*  He said the attacker was the commander's own sex slave, a teenager called Zabihullah. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=528.0s)]
*  Late one night he went on a shooting spree, killing seven policemen, including the commander, as they slept. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=534.0s)]
*  End quote. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=540.0s)]
*  And so we end up in a war where up until this most recent summer we were told that the enemy was so terrible that the threat was so great that we just had no choice but to ally with people who were engaged in systematic mass child rape. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=541.0s)]
*  There was just no other option. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=562.0s)]
*  Well, but there are other considerations. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=565.0s)]
*  There are larger issues at play. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=568.0s)]
*  The world is not all black and white, and I'm probably oversimplifying things. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=571.0s)]
*  But I get all that. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=576.0s)]
*  And that's why I'm limiting my requests. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=578.0s)]
*  All I'm asking is that the people in our security and intelligence establishments get back on the same page as the rest of us in considering large scale child sex trafficking to be beyond the pale. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=581.0s)]
*  I start with this because I often find that the biggest hurdle to clear when trying to get people to look squarely at what we know and what we can reasonably infer about the Jeffrey Epstein case is that for most people it just sounds too horrible to be believable. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=596.0s)]
*  You know, sure, the government's corrupt, politicians lie, yada yada yada, but they wouldn't do that. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=613.0s)]
*  But we know they would. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=619.0s)]
*  Because they have. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=621.0s)]
*  And they've done much, much worse. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=623.0s)]
*  It's hard to know where to start this story. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=627.0s)]
*  And so I'll throw a dart at the map and start with the 2003 Vanity Fair story by the journalist Vicki Ward. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=631.0s)]
*  Miss Ward was one of the people, one of the few people who was on to Jeffrey Epstein very early, long before his first conviction back in the mid 2000s. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=639.0s)]
*  Back in the early 2000s Epstein was still getting press like this in New York magazine, quote, Jeffrey Epstein, international money man of mystery. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=648.0s)]
*  He comes with cash to burn a fleet of airplanes and a keen eye for the ladies to say nothing of a relentless brain that challenges Nobel Prize winning scientists across the country and for financial markets around the world. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=658.0s)]
*  Ever since the Post's page six ran an item about President Clinton's late September visit to Africa with Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker on Epstein's customized Boeing 727, the question of the day has been, who in the world is Jeffrey Epstein? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=673.0s)]
*  End quote. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=689.0s)]
*  Once again, unsurprisingly, American journalism does not miss an opportunity to be clown itself and to vomit all over the legacy of the real reporters who occasionally used to take up the profession. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=692.0s)]
*  Reporters like Vicki Ward, for example. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=706.0s)]
*  She was writing for Vanity Fair in the early 2000s when she got an early lead on what the talented Mr. Epstein was up to behind the scenes. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=709.0s)]
*  This is from the New York Times after Epstein was arrested more recently in 2019, quote, days after Jeffrey Epstein was arrested and charged with sex trafficking by federal prosecutors. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=718.0s)]
*  The fallout spilled into the media world with a former Vanity Fair journalist saying that she had been prepared to report on accusations of sexual misconduct against the financier years ago, but that the magazine had declined to print them. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=729.0s)]
*  The journalist Vicki Ward leveled her accusation against the magazine's former editor Graydon Carter in several forums, including on her own Twitter account, Slate's What Next podcast and BuzzFeed's AM to DM talk show. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=743.0s)]
*  As part of her reporting for an article published in Vanity Fair's March 2003 issue, Ms. Ward said she had collected on the record accusations against Mr. Epstein from three women, two of whom said they were victims of sexual assault. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=757.0s)]
*  Those accusations did not make it into the published version, end quote. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=771.0s)]
*  And so you think, well, look, a magazine's got to be careful, right? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=775.0s)]
*  Vanity Fair is a big publication. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=780.0s)]
*  They've reported on controversial stories in the past, and they got the experience to know where they stand. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=782.0s)]
*  So maybe the stories didn't get through the magazine's tight vetting process. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=788.0s)]
*  Maybe legal wouldn't let it through. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=792.0s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=794.0s)]
*  In fact, according to Ms. Ward, the story had already been through legal review and it was approved with the accusations included. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=795.0s)]
*  But then just before the article went to print. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=803.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=807.0s)]
*  In recent months, the press has been digging into news about the late Jeffrey Epstein, his powerful friends and the allegations that he sexually exploited dozens of underage girls. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=808.0s)]
*  For years, the media had paid only intermittent attention to the Epstein story until an investigative series last year in the Miami Herald. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=819.0s)]
*  NPR media correspondent David Folkenflick's story might help explain why. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=827.0s)]
*  It includes an early morning visit, a bullet and a dead cat. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=831.0s)]
*  One morning some years ago, Vanity Fair's editor in chief, Graydon Carter, arrived at the magazine's offices in Midtown Manhattan. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=836.0s)]
*  A man was standing still by himself in the magazine's reception area behind locked glass doors. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=843.0s)]
*  It was Epstein. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=849.0s)]
*  John Connolly was a Vanity Fair contributing editor who reported on crime and scandal. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=851.0s)]
*  Jeffrey had somehow gotten into the Vanity Fair's office before Graydon one day and he was torturing Graydon. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=855.0s)]
*  Connolly says Epstein repeatedly beseeched and berated Carter then and in subsequent calls, don't report on the young women. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=863.0s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein would terrorize people. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=869.0s)]
*  Vanity Fair eagerly dissected the missteps and foibles of society's elites and eagerly rubbed shoulders with them. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=871.0s)]
*  And for years, Graydon Carter led the way on both. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=877.0s)]
*  In 2002, Carter assigned a reporter to find out more about Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=880.0s)]
*  Just who is this enigmatic financier and why is he flying around with Bill Clinton and other celebrities? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=884.0s)]
*  Here's that reporter, Vicki Ward. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=890.0s)]
*  At the time it was two pronged. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=892.0s)]
*  You know, the mystery about Jeffrey Epstein was how he had made his money. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=894.0s)]
*  Ward spoke on Morning Edition last month. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=898.0s)]
*  It was also known that he would gather New York's rich and famous for dinner parties at his home. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=900.0s)]
*  But there would be these very young women. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=907.0s)]
*  The women were always part of the Jeffrey Epstein story. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=910.0s)]
*  In March 2003, Vanity Fair did publish a piece by Ward taking a tough look at Epstein's lavish lifestyle and questioning the origins of his fortune. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=914.0s)]
*  Connolly says Carter soon called to share an ominous development. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=923.0s)]
*  The day it came out, there was a live bullet put on Graydon's, you know, outside his house in Manhattan. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=927.0s)]
*  Even in the absence of any evidence Epstein was involved, Connolly tells NPR that both Carter and he considered the bullet a clear warning. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=934.0s)]
*  That wasn't a coincidence. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=942.0s)]
*  Another former colleague tells NPR of a similarly anguished call from Carter about the bullet. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=944.0s)]
*  In statements to NPR, Carter says the magazine never held back on Epstein because of any sense of threat or intimidation. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=949.0s)]
*  Instead, Carter says Ward's reporting did not pass the legal threshold for publication. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=955.0s)]
*  He says Vanity Fair took legal requirements seriously, especially when the subject was a private person who's therefore rigorously protected under libel laws. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=960.0s)]
*  And he said Ward did not have three sources who met the magazine's legal threshold. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=968.0s)]
*  For the first time, however, Maria and Annie Farmer are confirming publicly they spoke to Vicki Ward on the record in 2002. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=972.0s)]
*  Their mother, Janice Farmer, says she did too. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=979.0s)]
*  And they tell NPR they were crestfallen Vanity Fair didn't report their allegations of exploitation. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=982.0s)]
*  I think it made it more difficult to not only get victims to speak out, but to get witnesses to speak out. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=987.0s)]
*  David Boyce is a lawyer for the Farmer Sisters. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=994.0s)]
*  It was discouraging. I think it helped create the impression among many of the victims that the media was under Epstein's control, that Epstein had all this power. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=996.0s)]
*  By late 2006, John Connolly says he was interviewing other women in South Florida to see if there was another story for Vanity Fair to do, as authorities investigated Epstein. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1009.0s)]
*  Connolly tells me Carter soon received another shock. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1018.0s)]
*  Let me stop you right there. You said a dead cat's head was put outside Graydon Carter's house? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1022.0s)]
*  It was put on the stoop of his home up in the country. It was done to intimidate, no question about it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1028.0s)]
*  And it worked? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1034.0s)]
*  Yeah, it did. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1035.0s)]
*  Connolly says Carter called him to express anxiety for the safety of his children. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1036.0s)]
*  Others tell NPR the dead cat was the talk of the office. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1040.0s)]
*  And Connolly says he voluntarily stopped pursuing the subject for Vanity Fair. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1043.0s)]
*  Well, it's natural to ask how someone like Epstein can get away with that. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1047.0s)]
*  Sure, he's rich, but so was Bill Cosby. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1053.0s)]
*  Being Speaker of the House of Representatives did not save Denny Hastert. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1057.0s)]
*  It's very interesting. We've all heard the saying about journalism, the old saying, if it bleeds, it leads, meaning the news media is biased toward sensationalism in general. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1063.0s)]
*  But if that's true, if they're just looking for sensationalism, it's fair to wonder why every newspaper in the land does not have investigative teams devoted to the Jeffrey Epstein story. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1075.0s)]
*  Billionaire playboy with deep connections to the rich and powerful running a massive multi-state underage sex trafficking operation. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1086.0s)]
*  Corroborated accounts from accusers about very well known people being involved. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1095.0s)]
*  A federal prosecutor saying he was told to back off by his superiors because Epstein belongs to intelligence. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1100.0s)]
*  I mean, at the height of the MeToo purge, news outlets devoted teams of reporters to investigating important people for anything that might get them another scalp. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1108.0s)]
*  You know, the combination of gossip columns, salaciousness and reader interest with the conferred seriousness of reporting that was part of a movement for gender equality, it was just too good to pass up. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1117.0s)]
*  But if there was ever a target rich environment for media outlets fighting tooth and nail for audience share, it's the Jeffrey Epstein story. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1127.0s)]
*  But no corporate news outlet seems to want anything to do with it. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1137.0s)]
*  How could that be? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1141.0s)]
*  It's not that they've looked deeply into it and just concluded that there's nothing there worth further investigation. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1144.0s)]
*  That didn't happen. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1150.0s)]
*  In any case, it's never stopped them before if they think they've got a story with the kind of guaranteed ratings that Epstein brings. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1152.0s)]
*  Again, there have been some really beloved and powerful people. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1160.0s)]
*  You think Denny Hastert, who if you're a little younger and unaware, Denny Hastert is the highest ranking U.S. official ever to serve a prison sentence. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1164.0s)]
*  He was the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, so second in line to the presidency right behind the vice president. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1173.0s)]
*  Guy with the same juice that Nancy Pelosi carries today. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1180.0s)]
*  You don't get to a position like Speaker of the House by public acclamation. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1185.0s)]
*  It's not an American Idol vote by phone kind of thing. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1190.0s)]
*  The people who get fingered for positions at that level come in two types. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1194.0s)]
*  They've either spent decades building a very powerful social network so that when they're jostling with other power players who want that position, they've got more artillery to call in for backup. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1198.0s)]
*  Or their puppets or front men put up by others who think that they can control things from behind the scenes. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1210.0s)]
*  Denny Hastert was a bit of both. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1216.0s)]
*  He was a very powerful guy in Washington, but he was easy to control for anyone who knew his secret, which was that Speaker of the House of Representatives Denny Hastert was a, quote, serial child molester. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1219.0s)]
*  In the words of the judge who eventually sentenced him to prison. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1231.0s)]
*  This was not in the early 1800s or something, by the way, folks. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1236.0s)]
*  This was the Speaker of the House until 2007. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1240.0s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1244.0s)]
*  With all the mud that's flung back and forth between Democrats and Republicans. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1246.0s)]
*  I mean, they call each other traitor, terrorist, murderer, Nazi, communist. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1251.0s)]
*  And so isn't it weird that almost nobody even remembers that the most powerful Republican congressman was in prison for molesting children less than 15 years ago? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1257.0s)]
*  You think the Democrats would be just, they would just be carpet bombing that fact all over the place. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1268.0s)]
*  They're reminding us every day about it and with some justice. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1274.0s)]
*  This is a guy, Hastert, who built his early political career on this image of being a teacher and a coach and a mentor to young boys. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1278.0s)]
*  And he was a straight up predator. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1285.0s)]
*  But nobody wants to talk about it. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1289.0s)]
*  It's one of the things that nobody really wants to talk about to the point that most people bring it up and even people who remember it from the time they're like, oh, yeah, they kind of remember, but it's faded out of public memory. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1291.0s)]
*  I can understand what people don't want to talk about. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1303.0s)]
*  I don't really want to talk about any of this stuff either. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1305.0s)]
*  But maybe the people who should be talking about it are worried that if the public starts asking some pretty basic questions like how does a literal serial child molester rise through the ranks for decades to become the most powerful man in Congress without anybody noticing what he was up to. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1309.0s)]
*  Why, when he was caught, did he get 13 months in prison when we routinely give decades to drug offenders and people running Ponzi schemes and financial schemes? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1328.0s)]
*  Think about Bill Cosby, who I mentioned, or even Tiger Woods or Harvey Weinstein. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1339.0s)]
*  When I saw Ron turned its gaze in their direction, that was it for them. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1345.0s)]
*  Not to compare Tiger to what the other two were accused of, but just in the sense that there was this embarrassing scandal, this devastating scandal, and it didn't matter that they were rich or powerful or had powerful friends or that a lot of people were invested in their success. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1349.0s)]
*  It did not matter. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1364.0s)]
*  Think about this. If Bill Gates or Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos got hauled in with dozens of underage girls accusing them of sexual assault, each of them independently corroborating the other's accounts, accounts that sync up with flight logs and visitor records and known travel of other people that they say were present. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1366.0s)]
*  Sure, those guys would have certain advantages, like being able to hire the most expensive lawyers or maybe being able to intimidate the girls into silence or just benefiting from some residual public goodwill if it goes to trial. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1388.0s)]
*  But if they couldn't keep those girls quiet and they couldn't intimidate them and they didn't have a good story to explain their corroborated accounts, those guys would be on their way to prison. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1403.0s)]
*  And also, they'd be in the headlines every day because it's a crazy story with guaranteed public interest. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1416.0s)]
*  And so the obvious question is, how is it that this guy, Jeffrey Epstein, who's rich and prominent, but he's not Bill Gates rich and prominent. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1424.0s)]
*  Maybe he was in control of a couple billion dollars and not all of it his, which is a lot, but it's not the kind of money that can put the US Department of Justice off you when there's dozens of underage girls willing to testify that you sexually assaulted them. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1437.0s)]
*  How is it that this guy seems to be able to dictate terms to the US Department of Justice? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1452.0s)]
*  These are the people who took down John Gotti and Denny Hastert and Pablo Escobar. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1459.0s)]
*  They weren't afraid to do that. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1464.0s)]
*  This is Amy Robach from ABC News, an anchor on the news show 2020. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1467.0s)]
*  You may have heard this. It was released by Project Veritas a couple years ago. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1473.0s)]
*  We were so afraid we wouldn't be able to interview Kate and Will that also quashed the story. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1489.0s)]
*  And then Alan Dershowitz was also implicated in because of the Plains. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1502.0s)]
*  She told me everything. She had pictures. She had everything. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1508.0s)]
*  She was in hiding for 12 years. We convinced her to come out. We convinced her to talk to us. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1511.0s)]
*  It was unbelievable what we had. Clinton. We had everything. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1516.0s)]
*  I tried for three years to get it on to no avail. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1521.0s)]
*  And now it's all coming out and it's like these new revelations. And I freaking had all of it. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1525.0s)]
*  I'm so pissed right now. Like every day I get more and more pissed because I'm just like, oh my God. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1530.0s)]
*  What we had was unreal. Other women backing it up. Hey, yep. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1537.0s)]
*  Brad Edwards, the attorney, three years ago saying like, oh, like we there will come a day when we will realize Jeffrey Epstein was the most prolific pedophile this country has ever known. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1544.0s)]
*  I had it all three years ago. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1554.0s)]
*  So do I think he was killed? A hundred percent. Yes, I do. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1561.0s)]
*  Because you want to he made his whole living blackmailing people. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1566.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1574.0s)]
*  There were a lot of men in those planes, a lot of men who visited that island, a lot of powerful men who came into that apartment. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1577.0s)]
*  I knew immediately. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1591.0s)]
*  And they made it seem as though he made that suicide attempt two weeks earlier, but his lawyers claim that he was roughed up by his cellmate around the neck. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1599.0s)]
*  That was all like to plant the seed. And then. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1608.0s)]
*  That's why I really believe it. Like really believe it. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1614.0s)]
*  See, now we're getting somewhere. Who would have enough juice to suppress a story like this? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1618.0s)]
*  Maybe not Bill Gates, but maybe the Queen of England. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1625.0s)]
*  Maybe a guy like Bill Clinton, who was groomed for his role early on, first as a Rhodes scholar and then at Georgetown, where he studied under Carol Quigley with Prince Turkey Al-Faisal in his class, the longtime head of Saudi intelligence. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1630.0s)]
*  And Bill Clinton was in deep with the CIA in the 80s when Colombian drug lords were flying their cocaine into Arkansas and he was governor there. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1645.0s)]
*  And so maybe a guy like that. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1652.0s)]
*  Epstein was not powerful himself, but he had backing from some of the most powerful networks in the world, partly because, as Amy Robach said, he likely had some very dark blackmail on some very important people. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1657.0s)]
*  And partly because of who he was gathering that blackmail for. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1670.0s)]
*  Which I think is the much more interesting and fruitful question. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1675.0s)]
*  So let's dig into that. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1679.0s)]
*  Anytime you're dealing with questions involving intelligence agencies, you are going to find yourself wading through a lot of circumstantial evidence. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1683.0s)]
*  You'll run into the same thing if you try to investigate the intelligence agencies more rambunctious cousins, organized crime syndicates. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1695.0s)]
*  And that's by design. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1702.0s)]
*  Everybody has a vested interest in keeping secrets. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1704.0s)]
*  They know what happens to people who don't. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1707.0s)]
*  And so you're not going to find written orders with signatures and detailed explanations of each party's role in the conspiracy. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1710.0s)]
*  The evidence that Jeffrey Epstein was working with an intelligence agency is mostly circumstantial. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1717.0s)]
*  It's likely to stay that way. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1723.0s)]
*  But cases can be built on circumstantial evidence if it piles up high enough that the burden is shifted to the other side to make their case for why this is all one giant string of coincidences and misunderstandings. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1725.0s)]
*  I'm working on this while the jury is still deliberating the fate of Ghislaine Maxwell. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1739.0s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein's occasional girlfriend, apparently. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1748.0s)]
*  And according to federal prosecutors and many of his accusers, she helped recruit and groom young girls to be abused by Jeffrey Epstein and that she would also participate in the abuse herself. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1753.0s)]
*  That's what she's on trial for. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1765.0s)]
*  A lot of people were hoping the Maxwell trial would bring out a bit of the truth that died with Jeffrey Epstein in his prison cell. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1767.0s)]
*  But, you know, really that was this courtroom is not the place to make that case. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1774.0s)]
*  And so those people have been disappointed. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1780.0s)]
*  If the prosecution starts veering off the main case, namely four known identifiable on the record victims of Epstein, as well as people who know them, testifying that Maxwell participated in sexual abuse to get that conviction. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1782.0s)]
*  And they start talking about Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton and Donald Trump or what that guy meant when Epstein when he said Epstein belonged to intelligence. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1798.0s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell is not charged with any of that. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1806.0s)]
*  The job of investigating those related matters should, in an ideal world, or at least a moderately functional one, fall to the news media and maybe to the legitimate counterintelligence mission of the FBI. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1809.0s)]
*  But this world is, of course, neither ideal nor functional. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1826.0s)]
*  So instead you get me. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1829.0s)]
*  There are researchers who have done a lot of legwork on the Epstein story. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1834.0s)]
*  People like Whitney Webb and Ryan Dawson. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1838.0s)]
*  If you're familiar with the work of those people, you're not going to learn really anything new here. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1841.0s)]
*  I'm trying to put everything together in one place to kind of give people a brief. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1845.0s)]
*  And, you know, if you've read whole books on this topic and everything, there's going to be things in here that I leave out. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1849.0s)]
*  I just want to hit a lot of the key points to give people a baseline understanding of what we know and can reasonably infer about the situation. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1855.0s)]
*  It's only been very recently that some mainstream sources were forced to admit that there are some interesting questions here. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1865.0s)]
*  Rolling Stone ran a story that was headlined, Was Jeffrey Epstein a Spy? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1873.0s)]
*  It was written by our friend Vicki Ward, formerly of Vanity Fair. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1878.0s)]
*  Quote, Back in 2002, when I was reporting on Jeffrey Epstein's finances for Vanity Fair magazine, he was not a household name. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1883.0s)]
*  During that time, I paid a visit to the Federal Medical Center, Devons & Devons, Massachusetts, to meet with an inmate, one Stephen Hoffenberg. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1893.0s)]
*  We sat in a little room near a recreation area. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1902.0s)]
*  Hoffenberg, dressed in the requisite orange jumpsuit, while I, several months pregnant with twins, was dressed per prison requirements, as shapelessly as possible. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1904.0s)]
*  It was an absolutely intriguing meeting. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1914.0s)]
*  Hoffenberg was serving 18 years in prison for committing a 450 million dollar Ponzi scheme. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1917.0s)]
*  In the 1980s, he'd been running Towers Financial, a debt collection and reinsurance business, and had worked alongside Epstein, who was a paid consultant. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1923.0s)]
*  Hoffenberg told me that Epstein planned to turn Towers into a global colossus through illegal means. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1932.0s)]
*  Hoffenberg told me with a sad grin that he represented a problem for Epstein, because while they were working together, Epstein had confided in him as to how, exactly, he made a career out of conning people and institutions, not least because the idea was that they would do it together. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1940.0s)]
*  Hoffenberg said that Epstein had a term for the perfect execution of the grift. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1956.0s)]
*  He called it playing the box, which meant that he ensured that even if his crime was uncovered, the victim would be unable to do anything about it, either because of social embarrassment or because the money was tucked away in a place where they either couldn't find or couldn't get it. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1961.0s)]
*  This again, this interview is from 2002. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1978.0s)]
*  This is before anybody knew who Epstein was. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1981.0s)]
*  What Hoffenberg had failed to realize, he told me, is that Epstein would con him. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1984.0s)]
*  Epstein would take 100 million of Towers money, move it offshore, and meanwhile cooperate with U.S. prosecutors against Hoffenberg, who was unable to do anything about this because he pleaded guilty, which meant that there was no trial and therefore no discovery. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=1989.0s)]
*  I can't prove all of Hoffenberg's claims, but some of them are accurate. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2005.0s)]
*  I have discovered, for example, that Epstein certainly did cooperate against Hoffenberg and gave at least three interviews to prosecutors, and that had the case gone to trial, a source with knowledge says it would have likely turned out far worse for Epstein than for Hoffenberg. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2010.0s)]
*  Hoffenberg also knew something else Epstein wanted hidden, according to Hoffenberg. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2026.0s)]
*  He claimed that Epstein moved in intelligence circles. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2030.0s)]
*  End quote. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2034.0s)]
*  So this is in 2002, before Epstein was ever arrested the first time or the second time before any accusations about him had publicly surfaced. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2037.0s)]
*  And his business partner, he and Hoffenberg worked closely for several years, is telling a reporter back in 2002 that Epstein was connected to intelligence agencies. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2049.0s)]
*  It would be just five or six years later in 2007 or 2008 that the federal prosecutor down in Florida, who was overseeing Epstein's case, Alex Acosta, was told, according to his sworn testimony, that he was told by his superiors to back off of Epstein because Epstein, quote, belongs to intelligence. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2062.0s)]
*  Back to Ward, quote. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2085.0s)]
*  So when I gingerly raised Hoffenberg to Epstein and mentioned that I had documentation showing that the two were linked, the financier turned really nasty. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2092.0s)]
*  He maintained he hardly knew Hoffenberg. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2106.0s)]
*  He just consulted briefly on a couple of deals that he'd not been involved in any prosecution of Hoffenberg and that if I wrote any different, things would turn out badly for me. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2108.0s)]
*  Here's exactly what he said. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2118.0s)]
*  If there's any implication of wrongdoing, I will take legal action against you personally. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2120.0s)]
*  I'm telling you so you understand. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2125.0s)]
*  I will be as harsh as I possibly can personally. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2127.0s)]
*  Not for the magazine, but you, because I had this discussion with you. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2130.0s)]
*  This relationship is with you. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2135.0s)]
*  You shouldn't risk your future for a job. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2137.0s)]
*  Back to Ward. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2140.0s)]
*  Now Epstein's sensitivity regarding Hoffenberg was equal to his sensitivity on what he called the girls. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2143.0s)]
*  He went berserk if you mentioned either subject. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2150.0s)]
*  In hindsight, one has to wonder if Hoffenberg presented an equally big problem as the girls would. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2153.0s)]
*  Hoffenberg told me that in the 1980s, after Epstein left Bear Stearns in ignominious circumstances, Epstein was trained in moving money offshore and that a mentor of Epstein's was someone Hoffenberg knew. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2160.0s)]
*  A British defense contractor who died in 2011 named Douglas Lease. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2172.0s)]
*  Hoffenberg claimed that Lease was an arms dealer. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2179.0s)]
*  Lease's son Julian says that's not true, but the UK parliamentary record does mention Lease in reference to the Alia Mama arms deal of the early 1980s. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2182.0s)]
*  I remember distinctly that in our first meeting, Hoffenberg told me that Lease was pivotal in understanding Jeffrey's MO. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2191.0s)]
*  Because Lease had introduced him not only to aristocratic Europeans, who Epstein subsequently fleeced, but to all sorts of people in the arms business, including the late Turkish-born businessman Adnan Kashoggi and, allegedly, the late media mogul Robert Maxwell. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2198.0s)]
*  Back in 2002, I didn't pay much attention to this. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2217.0s)]
*  This was because Epstein breezily threw me off. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2221.0s)]
*  First, Epstein told me he'd never met Maxwell, and I asked him twice if he knew Lease, whom I had never heard of, and Epstein said no. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2224.0s)]
*  The second time he elaborated, Douglas Lease, I think he was the father of somebody I knew? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2233.0s)]
*  I think his son was friendly with Ferranti. That's where that whole crowd comes in that you asked me about a long time ago. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2240.0s)]
*  I think his name was Nicholas? It was sort of that 66th Street building. I think they might have all lived there. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2246.0s)]
*  So I forgot about Lease, and I didn't bother to pursue the notion that Epstein had known Maxwell. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2253.0s)]
*  Those three people that Ms. Ward just mentioned, Douglas Lease, Adnan Kashoggi, and Robert Maxwell, those names will be familiar to people who have spent some time researching the deep politics of the late 70s and throughout the 1980s. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2261.0s)]
*  Sir Douglas Lease was a British arms broker, kind of a backroom dealmaker, as well as an agent of British intelligence, according to Stephen Hoffenberg and others who knew Lease and Epstein at the time, back in the 80s when they were associated. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2281.0s)]
*  Lease is supposed to have been one of the key brokers of the largest arms deal in UK history with Saudi Arabia. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2296.0s)]
*  Took place back in the 1980s. Lease worked with a Saudi counterpart, another sort of guy who operated in the shadows in those liminal spaces between sovereign entities, another arms broker named Adnan Kashoggi, who we just mentioned. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2303.0s)]
*  Kashoggi was this larger than life sort of caricature of a decadent Arabian prince. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2320.0s)]
*  He's not a Saudi prince, but just throwing around a ton of money, everything gold, everything big. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2327.0s)]
*  Donald Trump actually bought his yacht after Kashoggi eventually went to jail later on. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2334.0s)]
*  And his name, his last name should sound familiar. He's the uncle of Jamal Kashoggi, the Saudi journalist who was murdered and chopped up by Saudi agents in the Kingdom's embassy in Turkey in 2018. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2339.0s)]
*  So this is a family that's close to power. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2351.0s)]
*  Kashoggi was very close to both Saudi and Israeli intelligence and was only he was he was he almost served as a an almost official go between for the two governments, kind of an off the books diplomat. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2355.0s)]
*  Back in the 1980s, when the Reagan administration wanted to get weapons illegally to Iran during the Iran Iraq war, they asked Israel for help because Israel shared the same interest. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2376.0s)]
*  You know, they obviously Israel and Iran hate each other now. But back then, right after the revolution, when Saddam Hussein invaded Iran, what they're really worried about was Saddam Hussein and him getting too powerful if he conquered too much of it. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2387.0s)]
*  So so yeah, the Reagan administration wanted to get weapons to Iran to prolong the war. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2399.0s)]
*  They ask Israel for help. And what does Israel do? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2404.0s)]
*  Israel calls on the services of Adnan Kashoggi to make it happen. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2407.0s)]
*  Both Kashoggi and Lease were the kind of guys that you called when you were a government that needed something done but done discreetly. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2413.0s)]
*  Lease was the bag man bringing bribes to Saudi and British officials to make sure that the right companies got paid off in their big arms deal. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2425.0s)]
*  Adnan Kashoggi was an arms trafficker with connections all over the world who knew how to work around things like customs agents and national borders. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2434.0s)]
*  Well, Epstein gets close with both of these guys in the 1980s. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2442.0s)]
*  He worked with both of them. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2445.0s)]
*  And based on the above ground information, it's kind of hard to see what it is exactly that he would have been doing with them. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2448.0s)]
*  Epstein was already on a private plane headed to a meeting at the Pentagon with Douglas Lease in 1981 when Epstein is just 28 years old and hasn't done anything really when you look at his actual resume up to that point. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2459.0s)]
*  Let's take a moment and it will only take a moment because there's not much here to review what we know about Epstein up to this point in his life. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2474.0s)]
*  In 1981 when he's on that plane with Douglas Lease, Epstein had just left his job at the investment firm Bear Stearns after only five years. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2482.0s)]
*  He left under a cloud due to a regulatory violation. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2491.0s)]
*  He was forced out. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2495.0s)]
*  In a deposition years later, investigators were hammering Epstein with questions about insider trading all the way to the CEO of the company. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2497.0s)]
*  Well, before working at Bear Stearns, he had worked for two years teaching high school math, a job that he left amidst complaints that he was being inappropriate with his female students. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2506.0s)]
*  Surprise, surprise. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2518.0s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2520.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2523.0s)]
*  That's his resume up to this point. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2524.0s)]
*  He's a college dropout, but somehow got hired to teach mathematics at Dalton School, an elite private school in New York, who presumably could hire any high school math teacher in the country, but went with this guy who had no college degree and no experience teaching. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2525.0s)]
*  One of his students was the child of Ace Greenberg, who's a pretty well known vice president at Bear Stearns, a big investment bank, and Epstein's supposed to have befriended Greenberg and talked his way into a Wall Street job. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2542.0s)]
*  So he apparently starts out as a junior trader, but soon gets moved into a different area with the firm. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2555.0s)]
*  Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Kane, who remained close to Epstein years later, and who ran his shop in a way that Epstein would have appreciated, said, quote, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2562.0s)]
*  He was not your conventional broker saying buy IBM or sell Xerox. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2574.0s)]
*  Given his mathematical background, we put him in our special products division, where he would advise our wealthier clients on the tax implications of their portfolios. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2579.0s)]
*  He would recommend certain tax advantageous transactions. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2589.0s)]
*  He's a very smart guy and has become a very important client for the firm as well. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2594.0s)]
*  End quote. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2598.0s)]
*  So let me translate that for the kids in the back. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2599.0s)]
*  Epstein's job at Bear Stearns was to help rich people hide their money. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2603.0s)]
*  And he did it for some very rich and some very important people like Charles Bromfman, a billionaire from the Seagram's Liquor Fortune, whose name will come up again later. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2608.0s)]
*  And so that probably explains why Epstein maintained a strong relationship with Bear Stearns and personally with Jimmy Kane and Ace Greenberg, even after being forced out of the company for attracting the attention of regulators, because he got caught doing exactly what they were paying him to do. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2620.0s)]
*  Maybe he got a little overzealous with it. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2636.0s)]
*  And so now a picture, the beginnings of a picture starts to emerge. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2639.0s)]
*  Why would high powered arms brokers like Douglas Lease be on a private plane headed to a meeting at the Pentagon with a 28 year old college dropout, a failed high school math teacher and junior trader who just got fired from his investment banking job? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2643.0s)]
*  He's there because he's not looking for a math tutor or for investment advice. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2663.0s)]
*  He's looking for someone who knows how to hide and launder money. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2667.0s)]
*  And that's what Epstein had spent five years at Bear Stearns learning how to do. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2671.0s)]
*  In later interviews, Epstein was always coy about his business during this period, but he was more open with it with people who knew him back in the past. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2677.0s)]
*  He said he was a financial bounty hunter. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2686.0s)]
*  That's what he was employed as after he left Bear Stearns for a few years in the early 80s. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2689.0s)]
*  He was a financial bounty hunter. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2694.0s)]
*  A guy named Jesse Kornbluth, who was friends with Epstein in the 1980s, says that Epstein told him that he consulted for governments and companies and wealthy individuals to help them recover stolen money and that he also sometimes worked with people who had stolen a lot of money to help them hide it. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2697.0s)]
*  Another guy who knew Epstein in the 1980s says basically the same thing. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2714.0s)]
*  Epstein told him he was a financial bounty hunter who specialized at hiding and finding money. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2717.0s)]
*  And he also said that Epstein was one way or another connected to intelligence agencies. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2722.0s)]
*  Well, Epstein had concocted this ridiculous story about what he was up to in those years after he left Bear Stearns and started managing money himself. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2729.0s)]
*  He said his firm only accepted accounts of a billion dollars or more, which is just absurd. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2739.0s)]
*  This guy's under 30 years old. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2746.0s)]
*  He has no track record. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2748.0s)]
*  No one's ever heard of any big trades he's made, but even get him on the phone. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2751.0s)]
*  You not only have to be a billionaire, but you have to have a billion dollars to invest just with him. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2756.0s)]
*  It's just so stupid. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2763.0s)]
*  I mean, one Wall Street guy who knew him back then tells a story about how he thought one time that he would do Epstein a solid. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2765.0s)]
*  And so a wealthy friend of his was looking for a money manager to manage over 600 million dollars for him. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2772.0s)]
*  And so this guy offered to set Epstein up with him. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2778.0s)]
*  But Epstein turned him down, not because his client list was full or he was too busy, but because the account was just too small for him to bother with. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2781.0s)]
*  Now, it's just obviously absurd. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2791.0s)]
*  Someone with 600 million dollars to invest doesn't audition for his money manager. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2794.0s)]
*  They audition for him, especially in the 1980s. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2798.0s)]
*  That's like a billion and a half dollars. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2801.0s)]
*  Now, if you go to Goldman Sachs with a billion and a half dollars to invest, the CEO of the firm will greet you with the door before taking you on his private elevator to a conference room where vice presidents of the company will give you a presentation [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2803.0s)]
*  explaining how you're going to have a whole team of analysts and traders assigned specifically to your account and how they're going to be able to draw on data and intelligence streams from around the world and how he'll be first in line for lucrative private investments and IPOs and mergers that are handled by Goldman Sachs. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2817.0s)]
*  You know, this is the kind of red carpet treatment you could expect at the most powerful investment bank in the country if you showed up with that kind of money. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2834.0s)]
*  And supposedly this random guy who nobody really knows who's been managing money for a few years on his own supposedly just blows it off like it's beneath his notice. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2842.0s)]
*  It's just silly. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2853.0s)]
*  And I think it's pretty obvious what was going on, which is that he didn't want the account because Jeffrey Epstein was not really running a hedge fund. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2854.0s)]
*  People went around to players on Wall Street after the whole Epstein story blew up and asked people, people who know. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2863.0s)]
*  Have any of you guys ever worked with this dude? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2869.0s)]
*  Do you know anyone who has worked with him or done a deal with him? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2873.0s)]
*  Have you heard of any big deals he's done or big trades he's made? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2878.0s)]
*  Someone like Epstein, just to explain to some to some of you who aren't familiar with this world, someone like this guy who is supposedly managing enough money for billionaires that his personal fees, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2883.0s)]
*  which are often kind of one percent of the year's profit is kind of standard. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2896.0s)]
*  So if you're managing a billion dollars and the investments make 10 percent, 10 percent of a billion is 100 million. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2900.0s)]
*  You as the manager get one percent of that. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2906.0s)]
*  So a million dollars that year. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2908.0s)]
*  Well, Epstein's making way more than a million. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2912.0s)]
*  He's got the largest private residence in New York City. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2916.0s)]
*  It's nine stories tall, like 40 or 50 thousand square feet. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2919.0s)]
*  It's worth 70 million dollars. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2923.0s)]
*  He's got the largest private residence in the state of New Mexico on a 7500 acre ranch. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2926.0s)]
*  He's got a private island with a temple on it, a fleet of aircraft, more homes all over the world. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2932.0s)]
*  And he was supposedly a billionaire, but you don't become a billionaire making 10 million or 20 million dollars a year. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2942.0s)]
*  That's not going to get you there. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2949.0s)]
*  To get the kind of money that Epstein was showing and to get it in a relatively short period of time, really just less than a decade, six or seven years. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2952.0s)]
*  And he seems to be fully ramped up. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2959.0s)]
*  You'd have to be making moves in the market that the whole world would see happening. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2963.0s)]
*  Billionaires don't add a few shares of Microsoft to their E-Trade accounts. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2967.0s)]
*  Billionaires take a position in the company, meaning they have meetings with various brokers who pull together enough shares and structure the purchase in a way that doesn't absorb all the liquidity and make the market go bonkers. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2973.0s)]
*  Well, you don't do that for years without anyone else on Wall Street working with you or knowing anyone who worked with you or knowing about any deals or trades you've made or anybody who worked for you. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=2987.0s)]
*  A hedge fund is not just a guy at his computer making trades either. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3001.0s)]
*  Hedge funds have offices full of analysts and traders and economists and mathematicians and accountants, you name it. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3005.0s)]
*  It's a company. It's a whole operation. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3012.0s)]
*  Epstein didn't have any of that, as far as we're aware. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3014.0s)]
*  From Ms. Ward's 2003 article, quote, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3019.0s)]
*  Why do billionaires choose him as their trustee? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3022.0s)]
*  Because the problems of the mega rich, he tells people, are different from yours and mine. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3025.0s)]
*  And his unique philosophy is central to understanding those problems. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3031.0s)]
*  This is Epstein. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3035.0s)]
*  Very few people need any more money when they have a billion dollars. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3036.0s)]
*  The key is to not have it do more harm than anything else. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3040.0s)]
*  You don't want to lose your money, end quote. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3044.0s)]
*  Well, again, a billionaire can have anybody manage his money. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3049.0s)]
*  The biggest and most powerful firms in the world would fight over his account. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3054.0s)]
*  But they're supposedly giving it to this nobody who got pushed out of his firm for a regulatory violation [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3062.0s)]
*  and where he wasn't even working as a trader but a special products engineer, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3069.0s)]
*  a field in which he'd be much more limited on his own without the institutional backing. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3074.0s)]
*  And they're not giving it because he's just so brilliant and this eccentric genius who just has some intuition [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3079.0s)]
*  he's going to double our money. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3086.0s)]
*  Therefore, we're going to take a risk by giving our billion dollars to this guy. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3088.0s)]
*  No, it's just they're giving it to him just because they want to preserve what they have. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3092.0s)]
*  Well, that's just not how the world works. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3096.0s)]
*  You give your money to any investment bank in the world and say, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3099.0s)]
*  structure this in a conservative way that's going to make sure it's robust to turbulence and inflation [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3102.0s)]
*  and that I just don't lose what I have. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3108.0s)]
*  Any investment bank in the world can do that for you. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3109.0s)]
*  That's not why you go to a guy like Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3112.0s)]
*  In the real world, you go to a guy like Jeffrey Epstein to get things done that you don't want anybody else knowing about. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3116.0s)]
*  It's easy to think of money laundering like it's sort of an afterthought to the criminal underworld. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3123.0s)]
*  It's boring, but necessary appendage to the real crimes, you know, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3129.0s)]
*  but money laundering is as central to organized crime as it is to intelligence operations. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3133.0s)]
*  Nothing happens without it. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3140.0s)]
*  And you're running some off the books operation like, I don't know, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3143.0s)]
*  illegally selling weapons to Iran in order to raise money to illegally supply the Nicaraguan contrast. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3149.0s)]
*  It's not like Iran can just wire $800 million to the CIA's checking account. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3155.0s)]
*  These are massive sums of money that are really only dealt with by institutions. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3161.0s)]
*  And you've got to move it around across board. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3166.0s)]
*  I mean, think about like a four foot high palette of cash of $100 bills is about $50 million. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3170.0s)]
*  So moving around this is this kind of money. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3178.0s)]
*  You have to be able to do it through institutions. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3181.0s)]
*  And if you're doing that, then you're risking having it detected and tracked by people you don't want seeing it. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3183.0s)]
*  You got to move it around again across borders without anyone knowing. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3189.0s)]
*  Or if they find out to make sure that there's a great, legitimate sounding story, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3193.0s)]
*  at least on first pass about where this money came from and what it's doing. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3197.0s)]
*  This is what Epstein learned to do at Bear Stearns. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3201.0s)]
*  It's what he did there. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3205.0s)]
*  And it helps explain why he was on a private plane with Douglas Lease the same year that Bear Stearns dropped him. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3207.0s)]
*  It also helps explain why Lease would introduce him to another big arms dealer like Adnan Khashoggi. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3217.0s)]
*  Guys like that don't need a banker. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3223.0s)]
*  They've got bankers, but they always need good money launderers. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3225.0s)]
*  The third name that I mentioned a few minutes ago was Robert Maxwell, the British publishing mogul. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3230.0s)]
*  Douglas Lease introduced Epstein to Maxwell in the mid 1980s. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3239.0s)]
*  And after getting to know him for a couple of years, Robert Maxwell introduced Epstein to his favorite daughter, Gilene Maxwell. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3246.0s)]
*  This is in 1988. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3253.0s)]
*  Gilene Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, as is now well known, became lovers and confidants and partners in crime. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3255.0s)]
*  But she also seems to have had a role assigned to her by her father as a sort of all-in-one manager or handler of Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3263.0s)]
*  Through her father, she had access to the wealthy and powerful people that we now associate with Epstein. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3279.0s)]
*  Guys like Prince Andrew or the Clintons or whatever. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3285.0s)]
*  It was through Gilene that he got to know these people. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3288.0s)]
*  And she seems to have been something like his, I don't know, social manager. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3291.0s)]
*  She would make connections and set them up with people, bring them to parties and events and manage his calendar. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3295.0s)]
*  And his job was to show up and be Jeffrey Epstein, I guess. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3301.0s)]
*  And her job was to set everything up and kind of manage the situation. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3306.0s)]
*  Well, her father, Robert Maxwell, is a very interesting guy. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3310.0s)]
*  A lot of people don't remember him today, especially in the U.S. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3316.0s)]
*  Or if they do, it's only because he's the father of the notorious Gilene Maxwell. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3319.0s)]
*  But he was one of the most famous men in Britain and one of the wealthiest and most connected men on planet Earth until his mysterious death in 1991. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3325.0s)]
*  Robert Maxwell's birth name was Abraham Lieb. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3335.0s)]
*  And it would change a dozen times throughout his life. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3339.0s)]
*  When he was 15, his name was Jan Ludwig Heimann-Binjemenhoch. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3343.0s)]
*  And Nazi Germany had just annexed a large chunk of his home country of Czechoslovakia. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3348.0s)]
*  The next year, Hungary absorbed what was left and Jan, coming from an Orthodox Jewish family, sees the writing on the wall. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3354.0s)]
*  And so he escapes to France in May 1940, where he joins up with the Czechoslovakian army in exile just in time for France to be overrun by the Germans. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3362.0s)]
*  And so Jan is forced to escape again, this time to England, posing as a French soldier and using a surname that he caught from a brand of French cigarettes. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3372.0s)]
*  He's a very resourceful guy, especially as a young man, 16, 17 year old kid. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3380.0s)]
*  Once he gets to England, he links up with Czechoslovakian Zionist groups there, but eventually becomes frustrated with the Czechoslovak government in exile. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3386.0s)]
*  And so he joins up with the British military, first an engineering corps. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3397.0s)]
*  And then in 1943, he hooks up with a combat unit that saw action from the Normandy invasion all the way to Berlin. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3402.0s)]
*  He saw plenty of combat. He also participated in ugly business like interrogating captured Nazis. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3410.0s)]
*  Later, he'd be implicated in a war crimes investigation for murdering unarmed German civilians. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3417.0s)]
*  In January 1945, just a few months before the war's end, he was pinned by British General Bernard Montgomery with a military cross for storming a machine gun nest. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3424.0s)]
*  That's the military cross. This was the second highest British military award at the time. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3435.0s)]
*  Same as a Distinguished Service Cross or a Navy Cross in the US. That's a high award. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3440.0s)]
*  Jan made sergeant during the war and then received an officer's commission at the rank of captain right as the war was wrapping up in 1945. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3447.0s)]
*  Well, again, you can tell this guy's a hustler. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3455.0s)]
*  Okay, escapes two countries, has five or six names, joins two armies and fights his way through France to Germany all before his 25th birthday. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3458.0s)]
*  And the guy's a hustler and a grinder. And he gets things done when he sets his mind to it. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3466.0s)]
*  After the war, Jan was attached to the British Foreign Office and spent the next two years working for the British government's PR and propaganda outfit in Berlin, where they put his considerable language skills to work. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3473.0s)]
*  According to one of his biographers later, he was eventually fluent in nine languages, which I don't know, maybe that's a bit exaggerated, but certainly he spoke at least four or five. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3487.0s)]
*  In 1946, he was naturalized as a British citizen. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3498.0s)]
*  And he used the contacts that he made during the war, as well as those that he had from before the war back in Eastern Europe, to start up an import export business between the UK and the East. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3503.0s)]
*  Most, if not all, of Jan Hoek's immediate family had been killed during the war. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3515.0s)]
*  And like many Jews at the time, he was looking to Palestine as the only permanent solution to their troubles in Europe and elsewhere. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3521.0s)]
*  Zionism presented a bit of a problem because it ran headlong into official British interests and policy after the war. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3529.0s)]
*  After facilitating it for years, Britain had begun severely restricting Jewish immigration to Palestine just before the outbreak of war because of the terrible effects that the emerging Jewish-Palestinian conflict was having on Britain's relations with the Arab countries. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3537.0s)]
*  And they continued this policy more or less after the war. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3551.0s)]
*  And by this point, the Zionists believe, the Zionists in Palestine believe that they're ready to handle the Arabs on their own, if only the British would simply get out of the country. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3554.0s)]
*  But it never was the official British policy to hand Palestine over to Jewish control, and they'd spent a lot of time and money fighting for and developing the region over the years so the British were not eager to be driven off. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3565.0s)]
*  And so to help motivate them, Zionist terrorists began attacking British personnel in Palestine and assassinating British officials in other countries. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3577.0s)]
*  They blew up the British headquarters at the King David Hotel, killing 91 people. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3587.0s)]
*  They sent mail bombs to British officials back in England. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3592.0s)]
*  They even sent a mail bomb to the White House, addressed to President Trump, to the British government. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3596.0s)]
*  They even sent a mail bomb to the White House, addressed to President Truman, according to a memoir written by the man who served as the head of the White House mail room under six presidents, and an account that's confirmed by Truman's own daughter in her memoir. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3602.0s)]
*  You're Martyr Made Listeners, so you already know this story. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3617.0s)]
*  The Zionists still had their boosters in the British government, but by the late 40s, relations had deteriorated enough that things were difficult, especially on the ground. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3620.0s)]
*  There was a great deal of hatred passing between the British and the Zionists there in Palestine, so that when the British were finally driven out of the country in 1948, they were very bitter about it, and they slapped a weapons embargo on the emerging Israeli state just as war was coming with its Arab neighbors. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3633.0s)]
*  So to get people and weapons into Palestine, the Zionists were going to have to work through unofficial channels to get around the British blockade, and they drew on every thread that they could reach. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3650.0s)]
*  For example, Lyndon Johnson, US President after Kennedy, a Jewish historian from Texas named Louis Gamalak, studied LBJ's early relationship with the Zionists, which went way back. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3662.0s)]
*  His aunt was a founding member of the Zionist Organization of America, and Gamalak found evidence that LBJ and his friend Jim Novy, who was a wealthy Zionist down there in Texas where LBJ operated, were involved together in smuggling weapons into Palestine in crates that were marked for Texas grapefruit. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3674.0s)]
*  Gamalak doesn't really explain how the smuggling was accomplished, but it was not a US government operation. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3693.0s)]
*  It was something LBJ was doing on his own in violation of American law. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3700.0s)]
*  Raising the money to buy large quantities of military hardware and getting that hardware off the books and then shipping it halfway around the world to a country under embargo by the British, that's a major operation. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3705.0s)]
*  It's handled by not just some guy that you met down at the bar. This is going to be handled by established smuggling outfits. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3721.0s)]
*  And if you're talking about smuggling in the midst of the total destruction of commerce and infrastructure following the Second World War, you're going to be dealing with organized crime. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3730.0s)]
*  It was helpful that Jewish mobsters in the United States and other countries tended to be sympathetic to the Zionists because, well, partly because both groups were at war in different ways with the communists. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3740.0s)]
*  Another string that the Zionists pulled on was that of a young Jewish war veteran turned import-export businessman from Czechoslovakia. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3753.0s)]
*  Exactly the kind of person who would know how to get things from one place to another in the complicated post-war environment. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3763.0s)]
*  The new communist government in Prague made an agreement to ship weapons, many of them seized from the Germans, to the Zionists in exchange for cash. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3770.0s)]
*  But they still needed a way to get the gear down to Palestine. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3780.0s)]
*  And that's where men like our current protagonist Jan Hoke, who got things from one place to another for a living, came in. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3784.0s)]
*  The weapons shipments from Czechoslovakia that were facilitated by Jan Hoke at the time [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3792.0s)]
*  were considered decisive in that first war against the Arabs, the Israeli War of Independence, especially because of the aircraft they delivered, aircraft which were the specific smuggling assignment of Jan Ludwig Heimann-Binum in Hoch. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3798.0s)]
*  Or actually, he had officially changed his name to better fit into British society by this point, so we will call him by his new name now, Robert Maxwell. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3811.0s)]
*  In 1951, Maxwell, still only 28 years old, really amazing when you think about it, he bought a small publisher of scientific books. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3822.0s)]
*  And he gained the US and UK distribution rights for a much larger continental European publisher of scientific books. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3832.0s)]
*  I don't know too many of the details of these businesses in the early days, but according to at least two of his biographers, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3840.0s)]
*  Maxwell had an effective monopoly editing and distributing scientific and engineering journals being translated into English out of Germany and other European countries. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3846.0s)]
*  Before long, he had built the company into a major publishing house and had become extremely wealthy. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3858.0s)]
*  In the 1960s, he runs for and wins a seat in the House of Commons. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3864.0s)]
*  In the early 1980s, he buys a group of six newspapers, including the Daily Mirror. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3871.0s)]
*  A few years later, he buys Macmillan, one of the big five English language publishers. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3876.0s)]
*  He bought the New York Daily News. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3881.0s)]
*  He tried with the billionaire Charles Bromfman of the Seagrams Liquor Fortune to buy the Jerusalem Post. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3884.0s)]
*  By the end of the 1980s, Robert Maxwell was one of the most famous men in Britain. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3890.0s)]
*  He was one of the world's most well-known publishers and his empire was vast. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3896.0s)]
*  His net worth, according to Forbes, was in the one to two billion range, which is maybe four or five billion dollars today. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3901.0s)]
*  At a time when there were a lot fewer billionaires, you know, like now every rando hedge fund manager, college dropout computer programmer has a billion dollars. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3909.0s)]
*  That was not how it was back then. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3917.0s)]
*  Was a combat veteran, a businessman, a linguist, a smuggler and an experienced propagandist with contacts across Europe, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3920.0s)]
*  including behind the Iron Curtain, as well as in Britain and the Middle East. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3930.0s)]
*  Robert Maxwell was obviously very interesting to intelligence agencies after the war and throughout his life. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3934.0s)]
*  The British Foreign Office and the FBI for a while suspected that he might have been working for the Russians. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3941.0s)]
*  But most people who have researched the topic think this was probably a misunderstanding. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3948.0s)]
*  Robert Maxwell, it's hard to relate to a guy like this. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3953.0s)]
*  He was really this larger than life international figure who seemed to have almost perceived himself as a sovereign country. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3959.0s)]
*  After all, the leaders of actual sovereign countries kowtow to him all the time, call on him to ask for favors and beg for his support and to draw on his connections around the world. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3970.0s)]
*  He's not calling them for help. They're calling him for help. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3981.0s)]
*  It's definitely true that Maxwell was doing things for the KGB and the Czechoslovakian communists in the 1960s, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3984.0s)]
*  as did his friend Jeffrey Robinson, a former British MP who's been described as Maxwell's bag man during that same period of time. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=3992.0s)]
*  But Maxwell, I think, would not have felt like he was an asset of Soviet intelligence because he was not some normal citizen. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4000.0s)]
*  He would have seen himself more like the way he was actually treated, which was as a sort of freelance unofficial diplomat who who is a British citizen. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4008.0s)]
*  But really, he kind of exists in the liminal spaces between these established power structures. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4019.0s)]
*  The FBI and British Foreign Office probably saw Maxwell sneaking around Eastern Europe, meeting with Soviet and KGB officials and thought he might be working on their behalf. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4026.0s)]
*  But we know today that Maxwell only served two masters, himself and the Zionist state of Israel. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4036.0s)]
*  His association with Israeli intelligence began with smuggling weapons in the immediate postwar years and over the years, his role grew. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4045.0s)]
*  As someone who had planes, yachts, contacts across the world, access to important people and legitimate business interests to provide excuses for international travel and meetings, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4053.0s)]
*  the Israeli Mossad put Robert Maxwell to many uses over the years. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4067.0s)]
*  If the Mossad needed to get a message to the head of the KGB without generating an official record, Maxwell delivered it. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4072.0s)]
*  If the Mossad needed money for an operation, but it couldn't be seen as coming from them, Maxwell would arrange to make it happen. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4082.0s)]
*  And in general, he would just keep his eyes and ears, as well as the eyes and ears of the reporters working for him, open for anything that might be of interest to Israeli intelligence. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4090.0s)]
*  In 1991, a man named Ari Ben-Manasseh approached several British news organizations with some stories about Robert Maxwell. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4102.0s)]
*  Ben-Manasseh was an arms dealer and a 10-year veteran of Israeli military intelligence. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4112.0s)]
*  He claimed that Maxwell and his foreign editor at the Daily Mirror, Nicholas Davies, were both longtime Mossad agents, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4118.0s)]
*  and that, among other things, Maxwell had informed the Israeli government of the identity of the Israeli whistleblower, Mordecai Vannunu, in 1986, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4127.0s)]
*  after Vannunu approached one of Maxwell's papers with evidence exposing Israel's long-denied nuclear program. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4136.0s)]
*  Ben-Manasseh also claimed that Maxwell had helped set a honey trap that led to Vannunu being kidnapped in Rome, then shipped off to Israel and thrown in prison. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4143.0s)]
*  He also claimed that Robert Maxwell had played a role in what became known as the Iran-Contra affair of the Reagan administration. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4153.0s)]
*  I remember several years ago, in my former life with the Department of Defense, one time we all had to attend a training evolution on how to recognize an insider threat, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4164.0s)]
*  meaning fellow DOD employee or contractor who might leak classified information to foreign governments or other parties that the U.S. government would not want to have it. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4177.0s)]
*  They tell us to watch out for people who suddenly start showing a lot of money or people who are known to gamble a lot or who owe a lot of money, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4187.0s)]
*  things that might cause them to want to do something like sell military secrets to another country. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4196.0s)]
*  As part of this training, they went through maybe a dozen real-life historical examples of people who had done this, like in recent decades, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4202.0s)]
*  so that we could see the patterns and kind of get a profile of what to look for. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4211.0s)]
*  But there's this strange, awkward elephant in the room. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4215.0s)]
*  Out of the dozen or so real-life examples they covered, all but two, maybe three, shared one very obvious characteristic that nobody was mentioning, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4219.0s)]
*  namely that almost all of these espionage examples that they provided were carried out by Americans of certain ethnic origins who were leaking secrets to their ancestral homeland out of a feeling of national duty or pride. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4232.0s)]
*  As they go through three, four examples, seven, eight, nine examples where this pattern holds, it's becoming a little awkward in the room [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4249.0s)]
*  because there's an obvious question to be asked but one that no one doing this training really wants to answer. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4258.0s)]
*  Well, leave it to me. Everyone knows I'm a bit of a troll, but you know, my trolling usually has a purpose. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4266.0s)]
*  The entertainment that I get out of it is sort of a side effect, or maybe if I'm being honest, one of the side effects of entertaining myself is that some actual purpose is also served. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4273.0s)]
*  I like to think so. And so I raise my hand and I point out the obvious, that most of their examples involved Chinese Americans leaking to China, Jewish Americans leaking to Israel, Russian American leaking to Russia, etc. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4284.0s)]
*  And I asked how we should handle that information as we go forth to spy and inform on our work colleagues. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4298.0s)]
*  And you can hear a pin drop in the place. This, by the way, is how you make yourself very popular with the rank and file and very unpopular with upper management. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4304.0s)]
*  But I wouldn't have poked the bear if I didn't think they were all doing us a genuine disservice by not addressing the question because it's an important question and relevant one. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4315.0s)]
*  And so the trainer is clearly uncomfortable and doesn't want to answer the question. But at least he was honest. He told us not to consider that information at all to put it out of our minds. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4324.0s)]
*  I understand his discomfort. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4335.0s)]
*  I got a bunch of raised eyebrows and dirty looks just for asking the question. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4338.0s)]
*  It's a hard problem for a multi ethnic, multicultural, open society like ours. It's a genuinely hard problem. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4344.0s)]
*  Over in China, Chinese intelligence probably has a file on every single person of European ancestry in their entire country. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4352.0s)]
*  They're not putting anyone whose parents were German American in charge of their military research laboratories. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4362.0s)]
*  And there aren't many people like that in China anyway. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4371.0s)]
*  During the Cold War, we were able to call on ideological sympathy to recruit assets from behind the Iron Curtain. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4375.0s)]
*  But we can't appeal to a foreigner's American patriotism or ethnic pride the way that other countries might be able to call on ethnic pride or nationalism to recruit assets in America. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4385.0s)]
*  Moreover, when you try to ferret out disloyalty in large groups where the pattern of offender is predictable but the vast majority of people are not a problem, things can go wrong very fast. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4397.0s)]
*  It's really hard to be effective without casting a very wide net. But casting a wide net for potential traitors and saboteurs and subversives has been the cause of many of the ugliest events in human history. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4410.0s)]
*  A few Japanese Americans help a downed Japanese pilot on the Hawaiian island of Nihao after Pearl Harbor. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4422.0s)]
*  And pretty soon, 120,000 Japanese are being rounded up and thrown into camps. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4429.0s)]
*  So I can understand why the trainer just wanted to get through his course without addressing a topic that might not have any good answer, but that we know from experience has many bad ones. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4434.0s)]
*  But I put him on the horns of a dilemma. And I left him with only two choices, neither of them very good. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4445.0s)]
*  He could do what he did and tell us not to notice what was very obvious and relevant information, which would undermine his training by showing that the government is not so concerned about protecting military secrets that it would risk offending anyone. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4451.0s)]
*  Or he could go the other route and risk becoming the subject of an HR complaint for telling us to watch out for those sneaky Ruskies, Chinamen, and Jews. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4463.0s)]
*  Maybe there's a healthy, acceptable middle ground in there, but I don't blame him for not wanting to find out. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4473.0s)]
*  But we're not talking about nationalities or religious beliefs. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4481.0s)]
*  We are talking about the behavior of governments and intelligence agencies. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4486.0s)]
*  If someone brings up MKUltra or CIA interference in other countries, I don't pull up like, how dare you say that about Americans? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4490.0s)]
*  The CIA is not synonymous with Americans. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4497.0s)]
*  Just like Chinese state security is not synonymous with Chinese intelligence. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4500.0s)]
*  When we refuse to deal honestly with the history for fear of what people might do with this information, we just drive the discussion underground where it rots and festers and it's stinging with the information that we're trying to get. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4504.0s)]
*  And we're not going to be able to do that. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4517.0s)]
*  Let's say your kid wanders accidentally onto 4chan and someone there says something about the disproportionate number of Jews in the first Soviet governments and secret police. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4519.0s)]
*  And your kid is a little bit scared. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4527.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh, I'm going to be a little bit scared. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4530.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh, I'm going to be a little bit scared. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4533.0s)]

*  Oh, he says it wasn't just the early Soviet government. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4587.0s)]
*  He says there's a global conspiracy by powerful Jews against white Christian countries. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4591.0s)]
*  Well, he would ask Mrs. Silverstein about this or his parents because they should know. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4596.0s)]
*  But he's already learned that they're either lying or part of the cover-up. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4603.0s)]
*  And so now he's cut off from outside influences on the subject. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4606.0s)]
*  And he's in this whole rabbit hole. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4610.0s)]
*  It's like a mental disease. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4613.0s)]
*  I've seen consume intelligent people before my very eyes. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4615.0s)]
*  You know, one day someone is criticizing the Mossad and you're like, right on. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4618.0s)]
*  Next day he's talking about the USS Liberty. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4622.0s)]
*  You're like, okay. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4625.0s)]
*  And before long you can't bring the guy into mixed company because he cannot get through a conversation without mentioning the Jews. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4627.0s)]
*  This happens. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4633.0s)]
*  This is to a great extent the result of having legitimate discussions on some of these topics controlled and shut down. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4634.0s)]
*  It's not the result of a failure to control or shut down these discussions. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4645.0s)]
*  This is a difficult obstacle to getting people to look squarely at the Jeffrey Epstein story. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4652.0s)]
*  No one would worry much about suggesting that Jeffrey Epstein was being run by Russian intelligence. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4657.0s)]
*  But everyone seems to know that they're walking on thin ice when they bring up the overwhelming circumstantial evidence of his involvement with Israeli intelligence. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4664.0s)]
*  But these are just tricks. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4673.0s)]
*  And again, not tricks by nations or religions or ethnicities, but by governments and intelligence agencies who want to control discourse for their own purposes. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4676.0s)]
*  They're just tricks and we should not fall for them. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4685.0s)]
*  Part two. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4694.0s)]
*  Bill, I know what happened last night. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4697.0s)]
*  And I know what's been going on since then. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4708.0s)]
*  And I think you just might have the wrong idea about one or two things. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4716.0s)]
*  Okay, he had a bruise on his face. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4724.0s)]
*  That's a hell of a lot less than he deserves. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4742.0s)]
*  Listen, Bill, I don't think you realize what kind of trouble you were in last night. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4746.0s)]
*  Who do you think those people were? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4751.0s)]
*  Those were not just ordinary people there. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4754.0s)]
*  If I told you their names, I'm not going to tell you their names. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4757.0s)]
*  But if I did, I don't think you'd sleep so well. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4761.0s)]
*  Have you seen this? [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4769.0s)]
*  Yes, I have. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4784.0s)]
*  I saw her body in the morgue. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4791.0s)]
*  Was she... [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4798.0s)]
*  Was she the woman at the party? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4802.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4815.0s)]
*  She was. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4819.0s)]
*  Victor, the woman lying dead in the morgue was the woman at the party. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4831.0s)]
*  Was the woman at the party? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4840.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4844.0s)]
*  Well, Victor, maybe I'm missing something here. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4850.0s)]
*  You called it a fake, a charade. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4855.0s)]
*  Do you mind telling me what kind of fucking charade ends with somebody turning up dead? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4860.0s)]
*  Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit, all right? [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4870.0s)]
*  You've been way out of your depth for the last 24 hours. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4878.0s)]
*  You want to know what kind of a charade? I'll tell you exactly what kind. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4881.0s)]
*  That whole play-acted, take-me, phony sacrifice that you've been jerking yourself off with had absolutely nothing to do with her real death. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4885.0s)]
*  Nothing happened to her after you left that party that hadn't happened to her before. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4894.0s)]
*  She got her brains fucked out, period. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4897.0s)]
*  When they took her home, she was just fine. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4901.0s)]
*  And the rest of it is right there in the paper. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4906.0s)]
*  She was a junkie. She OD'd. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4909.0s)]
*  There was nothing suspicious. Her door was locked from the inside. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4911.0s)]
*  The police are happy. End of the story. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4914.0s)]
*  Come on. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4917.0s)]
*  It was always going to be just a matter of time with her. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4919.0s)]
*  Remember? You told her so yourself. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4923.0s)]
*  You remember the one with the great tits who OD'd in my bathroom? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4924.0s)]
*  Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4944.0s)]
*  If someone died, it happens all the time. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4948.0s)]
*  Life goes on. It always does. Until it doesn't. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4950.0s)]
*  But you know that, don't you? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4956.0s)]
*  You're dealing with a situation like the Jeffrey Epstein issue and his potential connections to intelligence agencies, relationships with intelligence agencies. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4959.0s)]
*  For all of our sort of conspiratorializing about the CIA and all the stuff we do know about what intelligence agencies have gotten up to in the 20th century, superficially a lot of us are super, super cynical. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4970.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, they would do anything. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4981.0s)]
*  They would overthrow governments just to help a corporation increase the bottom line. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4983.0s)]
*  Whatever it is, we have no problem theoretically doing something. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4988.0s)]
*  We have no problem with the government. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4992.0s)]
*  We have no problem with the government. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4994.0s)]
*  But in reality, when we're confronted with something new, not something from history, something emerges like this Epstein story. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=4995.0s)]
*  And most people, including myself, tend to have a sort of block that they have to overcome where you still, despite all of that, have this sort of in-depth understanding of what intelligence agencies have done to intelligence agencies. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5002.0s)]
*  That's too far. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5011.0s)]
*  It's just not possible. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5012.0s)]
*  It's not possible. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5013.0s)]
*  Somebody would have spoken up. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5014.0s)]
*  There's just, it's just not possible. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5015.0s)]
*  And so, you know, I think that's the kind of thing that we're dealing with. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5016.0s)]
*  I think that's the kind of thing that we're dealing with. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5017.0s)]
*  I think that's the kind of thing that we're dealing with. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5018.0s)]

*  I think that's the kind of thing that we're dealing with. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5026.0s)]
*  In the early 1960s, a young Ulsterman named Colin Wallace was recruited into the British [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5047.0s)]
*  Army's Public Relations and Psychological Operations branch in Northern Ireland. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5055.1s)]
*  Up to this point, there hadn't really been much trouble between Catholics and Protestants [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5063.36s)]
*  for some time. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5067.38s)]
*  And so at the time, the Northern Ireland assignment was kind of considered a sleepy assignment, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5069.02s)]
*  people would go to retire, things like that. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5075.639999999999s)]
*  And that's how it was when Wallace first got picked up there. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5078.5199999999995s)]
*  But then the 1960s happened, and just about every country had its version of the 1960s. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5081.4s)]
*  And so by 1968, Northern Irish Catholics were out in the streets protesting their political [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5088.2s)]
*  domination by the Protestants that were loyal to the British Empire. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5095.139999999999s)]
*  Fists in the air led to fists in the face. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5100.679999999999s)]
*  Fists led to bottles and rocks, which led to tear gas and bullets, which led to bombs. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5104.6s)]
*  And before long, the dark era known as the Troubles had begun in Northern Ireland. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5109.88s)]
*  And so all of a sudden, the Northern Ireland assignment for British military intelligence [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5115.96s)]
*  and administrative officials was no longer considered a retirement tour. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5122.72s)]
*  Suddenly it was at the center of British foreign and in a way domestic policy. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5129.08s)]
*  So as the security services were concerned, it was the first priority. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5133.96s)]
*  This was a view of the situation with which our guy, Colin Wallace, the intelligence officer [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5141.200000000001s)]
*  who was hired there that we're talking about, he actually agreed with this outlook wholeheartedly. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5148.52s)]
*  He was one of those guys, you know, the type who just finds his home in the military. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5154.160000000001s)]
*  Colin Wallace was. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5160.5199999999995s)]
*  He loves everything about the military, takes his duty completely seriously, buys into everything [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5161.48s)]
*  they tell him, believes whatever the official sources in his country tell him is going on. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5168.32s)]
*  That's that's who this guy was, just an unironic, true believer. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5174.12s)]
*  In Northern Ireland, his job was to cause other people to believe the same way. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5179.799999999999s)]
*  With the beginning of the Troubles, his job had gone from. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5187.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, a steady routine of like a PR professional publicizing community [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5192.4400000000005s)]
*  outreach events and fielding mundane questions from the press to now being engaged in full [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5197.64s)]
*  on information warfare and and black propaganda designed to help fight the war on Irish terror. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5206.6s)]
*  And so, for example, the provisional Irish Republican Army, which was the militant wing [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5217.4800000000005s)]
*  of the IRA that the British were struggling with in Northern Ireland, had gotten its hands [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5223.360000000001s)]
*  on some Russian made rocket launchers at one point. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5228.4800000000005s)]
*  And these rocket launchers had a defect in the firing mechanism that often caused them [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5232.08s)]
*  to malfunction and occasionally explode on the user. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5236.4400000000005s)]
*  The British authorities had captured a few of these and were able to figure out the cause [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5240.16s)]
*  of the failures, but they didn't want the IRA to figure it out. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5243.96s)]
*  At least they wanted to delay them figuring it out as long as possible. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5246.92s)]
*  And so they planted stories in the press is one of Colin Wallace's projects, planting stories [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5252.08s)]
*  in the press saying that the launchers had been found to be defective, but that it was due [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5258.2s)]
*  to something other than the firing mechanism, the trigger mechanism. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5262.32s)]
*  It wasn't really meant to hold up over time, but if it distracts the IRA from the confident use [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5267.24s)]
*  of these rocket launchers for a while until they figured out that would be considered a win. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5272.8s)]
*  That was the kind of thing that he was engaged in. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5277.16s)]
*  And fair enough, right? [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5279.96s)]
*  Fair enough use of information ops in a troubled area with a counterinsurgency going on. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5281.6s)]
*  Other times they would plant rumors in the press or among just the people [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5288.52s)]
*  about Irish rebel leaders, and they would put out stories designed to cause the public to hate [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5294.76s)]
*  and blame the IRA for the violence, basic propaganda stuff. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5302.2s)]
*  It was also his job to deal with any PR fallout from the mass roundups and detention [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5305.28s)]
*  without trial of large numbers of Irish Catholics. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5313.28s)]
*  In 1972, a demonstration against this policy of roundup and internment without trial, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5317.599999999999s)]
*  a demonstration against this was fired upon by British soldiers, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5326.76s)]
*  14 unarmed people got killed, another 12 were wounded. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5330.84s)]
*  And things kind of kept escalating. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5335.639999999999s)]
*  Bombings became a regular occurrence. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5337.32s)]
*  Ugly small unit street fighting and ambushes that don't end with one guy hoisting a flag up on top [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5340.5199999999995s)]
*  of a building in victory, but with the other guy being tied to a chair in a damp basement. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5350.68s)]
*  So the British SAS has brought in special air service, sort of their special forces, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5355.4s)]
*  and many counterinsurgency experts with experience in Kenya and other parts of the world are brought [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5364.16s)]
*  in. At a certain point, I believe in 1973, responsibility for intelligence operations [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5371.48s)]
*  in Northern Ireland is transferred from the portfolio of MI6, which is Britain's foreign [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5380.48s)]
*  intelligence agency, like the CIA, to MI5, which is Britain's domestic intelligence agency, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5386.36s)]
*  sort of like the FBI, not exactly. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5393.719999999999s)]
*  But MI6 had traditionally handled Northern Ireland, even though it was technically a domestic [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5396.04s)]
*  operation because Ireland was a foreign country and it was just easier for the same agency to [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5402.36s)]
*  cover both Ireland and Northern Ireland. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5408.84s)]
*  But for some reason, it was transferred to MI5 in the middle of all this trouble in the early 70s. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5410.84s)]
*  And all the people involved say that things really began to change once MI5 took charge. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5418.32s)]
*  The information operations that Colin Wallace was taking part in became much more aggressive. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5427.56s)]
*  They began planting completely false stories in the press. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5433.08s)]
*  Aligning Catholic leaders, attempting to incite infighting, and using these false stories to [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5438.52s)]
*  influence public opinion, not only in Ireland, but in Northern Ireland and in Britain itself. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5446.68s)]
*  So they were propagandizing the British people now. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5451.72s)]
*  And Colin Wallace is going along with all this like a good soldier. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5456.76s)]
*  I mean, he's doing his job to fight the war on terror. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5460.2s)]
*  That's how he's still approaching this. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5462.6s)]
*  It's the kind of guy he is, you know, sir, yes, sir. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5465.32s)]
*  And over time, he becomes just, you read the reports and the testimony of people who were there, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5468.84s)]
*  people he worked for, who worked for him. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5476.12s)]
*  And he becomes a major figure up there as far as like the middle management of the military [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5477.96s)]
*  intelligence apparatus is dealing with this area. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5484.28s)]
*  Very respected, recognized expert on Northern Ireland. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5486.76s)]
*  And he's often brought in to answer questions and provide briefs to generals and high government [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5491.24s)]
*  officials. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5495.64s)]
*  And at 29 years old, he becomes the youngest person ever to make lieutenant colonel in the [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5497.0s)]
*  British military. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5501.64s)]
*  Or at least he was the youngest one at the time. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5503.8s)]
*  Maybe that's what it is. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5505.88s)]
*  After Bloody Sunday, that bloodbath in 72 that I mentioned a second ago, politicians back in [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5509.0s)]
*  Britain are starting to feel pressure to put an end to this whole problem in Northern Ireland. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5515.320000000001s)]
*  And so they start making noises about peace and negotiation. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5519.88s)]
*  A conservative government is in charge at the time. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5525.64s)]
*  And even they're talking about going to meet with leaders of the Irish Republican Army to try to [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5529.320000000001s)]
*  work something out. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5534.84s)]
*  The Labour Party opposition is talking openly about cutting a deal if they win the next election. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5536.92s)]
*  And soon those meetings with the IRA do start to happen. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5544.04s)]
*  And the security services in Northern Ireland, MI5, military intelligence, [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5547.400000000001s)]
*  they go into like full panic mode. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5552.360000000001s)]
*  They're just not having it. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5554.200000000001s)]
*  Quote, in 1972, Prime Minister Harold Wilson met with IRA leaders in Dublin. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5555.64s)]
*  And the next year, the Northern Ireland minister, Willie Whitelaw, made similar contacts. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5563.72s)]
*  This utterly shocked opinion in every officer's mess in Ulster. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5569.160000000001s)]
*  And in MI5, who took over intelligence operations there from MI6 in 1973. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5573.400000000001s)]
*  Exactly like the French Army before it in Algeria, these key circles within the British Army [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5579.8s)]
*  now decided that in order to prevent a sellout of the imperial position in the overseas province [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5585.48s)]
*  by leftists, Guy Millet, Harold Wilson, or weak-minded centrists, Pierre Fimlin, Edward Heath, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5590.599999999999s)]
*  the military must ensure that the right sort of government came to power. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5598.2s)]
*  Operation Clockwork Orange was precisely this. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5603.24s)]
*  An attempt to smear and undermine Labour leaders and Tory wets alike. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5606.5199999999995s)]
*  The short-term aim being to prevent Labour being elected in February 1974 [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5612.76s)]
*  and to depose the likes of Heath and Whitelaw from the Tory leadership. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5618.2s)]
*  Anyone who helped the minority Labour government in power was fair game. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5623.08s)]
*  Thanks to Peter Wright's revelations, and Peter Wright was a high-level British intelligence officer [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5628.2s)]
*  who wrote an expose about some of this, we are more or less familiar with what went on in this period. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5635.24s)]
*  Though it is important to say that Colin Wallace was the first to make public admission of these [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5641.4s)]
*  campaigns, well before Wright. Homosexual smears were directed against Edward Heath, Jeremy Thorpe, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5646.04s)]
*  Norman St. John Steves, and Humphrey Berkeley. Bogus bank accounts showing corrupt earnings [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5653.48s)]
*  were contrived for Edward Short and Ian Paisley. Wilson was seen as the beneficiary of, and a [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5659.48s)]
*  possible participant in, the assassination of Hugh Gateskill. Lists were drawn up of such [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5666.6s)]
*  notorious communists and communist sympathizers as Brian Walden, David Owen, Robert Melish, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5672.76s)]
*  John Stonehouse, Roy Hattersley, and Reg Prentiss. And even a bogus pamphlet on revolutionary [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5679.8s)]
*  strategy for the installation of socialism in Britain was contrived for off-the-record [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5686.280000000001s)]
*  briefing of American journalists, the joint authors being Tony Benn, Stan Orme, and Dennis Healy. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5691.24s)]
*  One is tempted to say that even in the MI5 officer's mess, the idea of Dennis Healy [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5698.84s)]
*  collaborating with Mr. Benn and Mr. Orme on anything at all must surely have required the [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5703.719999999999s)]
*  assistance of a few double whiskies. The unhappier truth is that the minds that made such things up [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5708.44s)]
*  were quite possibly stone cold sober. Colin Wallace excelled at these black [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5715.0s)]
*  propaganda operations and for several years enjoyed his work. Gradually, though, he became [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5721.24s)]
*  uneasy at the extent to which his job seemed to be mainly about smearing and undermining British [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5726.76s)]
*  politicians rather than combating terrorism in Ireland. Moreover, the Army was now making [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5732.2s)]
*  its own Northern Ireland policy in a breathtakingly independent way. When the Heath government brought [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5738.44s)]
*  in a power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland with the Sunningdale Agreement of December 73, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5744.36s)]
*  many within the Army seemed to have seen this as the beginning of the end. Before long, a wet Tory [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5750.12s)]
*  or Labour government would sell out to the IRA completely. Accordingly, when the Ulster Workers [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5755.96s)]
*  Council decided to launch a general strike to bring down the power-sharing executive, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5761.96s)]
*  not only did it receive sympathetic backing from the Army, but there is even evidence that the [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5767.08s)]
*  strike was planned and encouraged by MI5 and its adjutants in Army intelligence and information [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5771.96s)]
*  policy. To mask what was being prepared and to create an emotional following wind in Britain, [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5777.64s)]
*  it was decided to launch a publicity blitz about an IRA doomsday plot, a plan for the evacuation [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5785.0s)]
*  of 100,000 Catholics to the south and a scorched earth policy in the north. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5791.72s)]
*  The plan had been drawn up by the IRA as a contingency plan against the possibility of a [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5795.88s)]
*  massive Protestant attack on Catholic areas of Ulster. It would now be presented as if it were an [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5799.96s)]
*  offensive strategy in its own right. When he saw what was being cooked up, Colin Wallace objected. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5806.04s)]
*  The idea of the plot was several years old and had already been used back in 1972. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5813.400000000001s)]
*  He couldn't, he said, recycle such old stuff without losing credibility. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5818.36s)]
*  But you don't have to, he was told. We'll get the Prime Minister to do it. And so they did. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5823.72s)]
*  On 13 May 1974, Harold Wilson announced a dramatic revelation to the House of Commons, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5829.08s)]
*  a suitably purple version of the doomsday plot fed to Wilson by the Army puppet masters. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5835.56s)]
*  Wilson even went so far as to warn the House that there will be an attempt to misrepresent this [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5841.24s)]
*  information, which is a genuine find by the security authorities, but I can assure the House [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5848.599999999999s)]
*  that these documents are genuine and not even put forward by the IRA themselves for any purpose [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5853.32s)]
*  except that in which it had in mind to pursue. Just 12 days later, under strong Army pressure, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5858.759999999999s)]
*  Wilson caved into the UWC strike and threw the power-sharing executive to the wolves. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5867.08s)]
*  Such incidents served to increase Wallace's concern that the Army was moving away from its [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5873.16s)]
*  alleged primary role of fighting terrorism. Worse, he became uneasy that the increasing number of [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5877.400000000001s)]
*  assassinations and bomb outrages against Catholics might be taking place with Army [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5883.96s)]
*  encouragement, perhaps even with covert Army planning. So in October 1974, Wallace announced [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5889.08s)]
*  that he didn't wish to work on Clockwork, but he did. He was told that the war was over. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5896.4400000000005s)]
*  That he was resigning in order to go back to fighting terrorism. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5903.64s)]
*  So a few weeks after he makes that announcement that he'd be moving on, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5910.280000000001s)]
*  Colin Wallace files another report. This is a report about a boys' home, an orphanage basically, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5914.280000000001s)]
*  a boys' home in Northern Ireland in the city of Belfast. It's called the Kinkora Boys' Home. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5923.0s)]
*  And this is actually the second time that Wallace had filed a report about this place. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5928.92s)]
*  This boys' home was being run by a loyalist paramilitary leader, widely believed, very, [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5934.92s)]
*  very widely believed, quite reliably to be an agent of British intelligence, a guy named William [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5941.56s)]
*  McGrath. Wallace starts seeing intelligence linking many high-ranking Northern Irish and [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5946.360000000001s)]
*  British officials to, well, to pedophiliac activities. And soon Wallace sees that the [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5955.32s)]
*  story seemed to revolve around this place, Kinkora Boys' Home. It turns out that complaints had been [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5962.6s)]
*  made about sexual abuse happening at Kinkora before, more than once, but they were always [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5969.88s)]
*  ignored. After Wallace satisfies himself that he has an idea of what's going on there, he brings [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5974.84s)]
*  the information to his superiors and he's ignored. And so he tries again, this second time here that [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5980.92s)]
*  we're talking about, and this time he's told to back off. Another officer, an army captain named [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5988.280000000001s)]
*  Brian Gemmell, also saw what was happening, tried to report it, but he was told to back off. This is [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=5995.4800000000005s)]
*  from an article in the Belfast Telegraph, quote, in emotional scenes, the police officers were [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6002.6s)]
*  told, quote, in emotional scenes, Richard Kerr, a former Kinkora resident who was sexually abused [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6008.28s)]
*  at the boys' home, has received an apology from the military intelligence officer who tried to [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6015.08s)]
*  expose the abuse. Brian Gemmell's words represent the first time Mr. Kerr has ever received an [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6020.12s)]
*  apology from the authorities who failed him. Mr. Gemmell was warned off revealing the pedophile [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6025.96s)]
*  activity at the East Belfast home by Ian Cameron, a senior MI5 officer who told him that this was [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6031.719999999999s)]
*  not a matter for the intelligence services or the army to be concerned with. Now Mr. Gemmell [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6038.2s)]
*  believes it was part of a cover-up of sex abuse by top people. He suspects that the intelligence [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6043.48s)]
*  services used such dark secrets as a way to control abusers who were politically influential. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6049.24s)]
*  As a captain, Mr. Gemmell put in an official report about Kinkora to a senior MI5 officer, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6055.48s)]
*  but to his astonishment, he claims he was ordered to stop digging and to forget about it. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6061.4s)]
*  He now feels that he should have exposed it, whatever the consequences for his army career. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6066.52s)]
*  Colin Wallace can't make any headway with his superiors. He decides that this is important [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6073.72s)]
*  enough to go to the press about. He's got a lot of connections in the press. He's interacted with [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6079.24s)]
*  these people for a long time, thinks he might be able to do that. This is a quote from a review [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6083.320000000001s)]
*  of a book about the Colin Wallace issue and Kinkora and Clockwork Orange and all this, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6089.56s)]
*  book by a journalist named Paul Foot called Who Framed Colin Wallace. It's a very good book. This [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6095.160000000001s)]
*  is a review of it from a review in the London Review of Books. Quote, no newspaper in the UK [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6101.0s)]
*  was willing to follow this obvious lead or even to publish the story despite the fact that McGrath's [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6107.240000000001s)]
*  associates constituted a virtual who's who of Protestant Ulster. What was going on at Kinkora [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6113.08s)]
*  was that the destitute boys were being systematically sodomized and abused by [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6119.72s)]
*  McGrath and his friends who included Kinkora's official director and assistant director. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6123.8s)]
*  This had been going on for many years, perhaps from as early as 1959, and repeated attempts by [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6129.88s)]
*  boys who had been raped to get the RUC interested in the matter had always failed. Nothing in Foot's [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6135.88s)]
*  book is more heartbreaking than his recounting of how over 20 years a series of boys and sometimes [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6143.0s)]
*  their families and social workers tried desperately and unavailingly to put a stop to their dreadful [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6149.16s)]
*  pain, humiliation, and buggery, and how the police, the press, and the authorities failed them over [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6155.08s)]
*  and over again. Quite clearly, neither the RUC nor Army intelligence were at all keen for the [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6162.36s)]
*  Kinkora story to be broken. This was so partly because McGrath and his friends were extremely [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6168.92s)]
*  well connected within the Protestant establishment, but the truth may have been [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6175.32s)]
*  worse than that. Intelligence services around the world often find it useful to maintain luxury [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6179.24s)]
*  brothels, not just for what they learn from pillow talk, but as multi-purpose centers of reward, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6185.08s)]
*  blackmail, and assignation. There was nothing luxurious about Kinkora, but its rarity in the [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6191.48s)]
*  Northern Irish context as an unlimited source of boys who could be buggered without mercy or [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6198.28s)]
*  publicity seems likely to have made it an especially useful intelligence asset. So in [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6203.96s)]
*  his insistent attempts to open up the Kinkora story, Colin Wallace was rocking the boat just [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6209.96s)]
*  as much as he was by refusing to have anything to do with Clockwork Orange. Well, the boy scout, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6215.24s)]
*  Colin Wallace, the naive boy scout, found out what kind of people he was messing with very soon. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6222.76s)]
*  And this is from that same review. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6228.76s)]
*  He was sacked, disgraced, persecuted, and made into a non-person. The Ministry of Defense has [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6258.84s)]
*  ever since denied that Wallace had been an intelligence at all. Thereafter, steps were [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6265.24s)]
*  taken to prevent him from getting other employment, and he was endlessly, miserably harassed. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6270.84s)]
*  The author, Foote, is scrupulous at every stage in trying to see whether a case against Wallace [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6277.08s)]
*  might not be made to stand up. And he makes it clear that he and Wallace do not see eye to eye [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6282.76s)]
*  about politics, Ireland, the Army, or just about anything else. But no fair-minded person can read [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6287.88s)]
*  this book and doubt Wallace's story. The only question one is left asking is how naive Wallace [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6294.84s)]
*  was really being when he raised objections first to Clockwork Orange and then to Kinkora. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6301.8s)]
*  Surely he was both too senior and too intelligent not to have known that both [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6307.08s)]
*  matters were utter dynamite and that one could not simply sign off on an operation like Clockwork [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6311.96s)]
*  Orange which involved key MI5 and Army operatives in acts of high treason? Was it not obvious that [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6317.56s)]
*  anyone who did try to sign off and then threatened to blow open the Kinkora scandal for good measure [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6324.52s)]
*  would be seen as a dangerous man who knew too much to be left alone? Far worse was to follow for [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6330.52s)]
*  Wallace. He at last gained a post as information officer for the Arun District Council in Sussex, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6337.8s)]
*  for whom he worked with his customary zeal and success. In various small ways he continued to [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6345.16s)]
*  be the subject of official harassment and surveillance, but in April 1980 he finally [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6350.599999999999s)]
*  consented to be an off-the-record source for a journalist seeking to probe the rumors of an [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6355.5599999999995s)]
*  MI5 plot against the Harold Wilson government. At almost the same time that these articles were [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6359.88s)]
*  published, four years before the spy-catcher disclosures, those are Peter Wright's book, [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6365.96s)]
*  the Kinkora scandal finally surfaced to the press. This had nothing to do with Wallace, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6372.04s)]
*  but the powers that be who had not wanted these skeletons out of the cupboard were doubtless [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6376.92s)]
*  confirmed in their view that it was too dangerous to have Wallace wandering around free. Three months [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6381.96s)]
*  later Wallace was arrested, found guilty of the manslaughter of his friend Jonathan Lewis, and [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6387.24s)]
*  bundled off to jail whence he only emerged in December 1986. It is, however, worth pointing [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6392.92s)]
*  out that Wallace's account of the attempted destabilization of Heath and Wilson was taken [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6400.28s)]
*  deadly seriously where it mattered most. Clive Pointing describes the atmosphere inside the [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6405.639999999999s)]
*  Ministry of Defense after Wallace had been jailed. There was never any suspicion that Wallace was [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6411.08s)]
*  making these stories up or that it was totally unfounded and very easy to rubbish. It was very [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6416.36s)]
*  much a matter that, okay, the story was being contained at the moment because he was in jail, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6421.32s)]
*  but in a few years time he would be out again and could be expected to start making the [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6426.68s)]
*  allegations again and then that would be a serious problem. Meanwhile, there was still Kinkora. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6432.200000000001s)]
*  The awkward question had to be faced as to why the boys of Kinkora had gone on being raped and abused [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6439.400000000001s)]
*  for 20 years despite repeated complaints to the police and despite Wallace's complaints to Army [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6445.240000000001s)]
*  Intelligence. From all sides of the Irish political spectrum came accusations of a police [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6451.4s)]
*  and intelligence cover-up. To make matters worse, it emerged that McGrath had apparently worked for [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6456.839999999999s)]
*  MI6 even before he became the arch-villain of Kinkora and was given the boasting of his links [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6462.28s)]
*  with MI6 and his friends in MI5. The first official inquiry by the McGonagall committee [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6468.28s)]
*  was promised that no limits would be placed on its investigation. As soon as it met, however, [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6477.16s)]
*  it was told that it could not examine any matter the police were currently looking into or which [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6482.2s)]
*  was covered by criminal charges in the past or in the future. Since just about everything to do with [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6487.0s)]
*  the scandal was covered by criminal charges, including the possibility of a cover-up, [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6492.44s)]
*  a majority of the committee's members resigned on the spot and the inquiry collapsed after less than [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6496.84s)]
*  a day, an occurrence unique in British history. James Prior, then Minister for Northern Ireland, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6502.12s)]
*  announced that the police investigation would continue. As for the question of whether there [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6509.48s)]
*  had been a cover-up after Colin Wallace and others had drawn attention to the Kinkora scandal, [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6514.12s)]
*  this would be investigated by Sir George Terry, Chief Constable of Sussex, who had just put Wallace [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6519.16s)]
*  away for manslaughter. Better still, the man appointed by Terry to take charge of the Kinkora [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6525.48s)]
*  inquiry was Gordon Harrison, who had been in charge of Wallace's prosecution. Unsurprisingly, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6531.48s)]
*  no Terry report was ever issued. Instead, Terry merely appeared at a press conference with Sir [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6537.879999999999s)]
*  John Herman, Chief Constable of the RUC, which Terry was supposed to have been investigating, [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6544.04s)]
*  where he announced, I am satisfied that there is no substance to allegations that Army intelligence [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6557.32s)]
*  had knowledge of homosexual abuse at Kinkora. Given that Wallace had provided exactly that [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6562.759999999999s)]
*  knowledge to Army intelligence many years before, the polite word for Terry's conclusion was [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6568.92s)]
*  incredible, though it is fair to add that other words were used at the time by some. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6574.44s)]
*  The Northern Ireland Alliance Party, moderate as ever, referred to Terry's conclusions as [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6580.599999999999s)]
*  misleading and blatantly dishonest. James Pryor now found himself besieged by demands for another [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6585.8s)]
*  Kinkora inquiry, this time by a High Court judge, as befitted the gravity of the case. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6592.76s)]
*  Pryor paid fulsome tribute to Terry, accepted that there would have to be another inquiry, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6598.52s)]
*  i.e. that Terry's was unsatisfactory, but then set up a low-level affair under Judge Hughes, [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6603.24s)]
*  a retired circuit judge. Mr. Pryor did, however, specifically assure the House that it would be [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6609.24s)]
*  within Hughes' terms of reference to investigate the allegation of a cover-up, i.e. the question [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6615.0s)]
*  of why there had been no inquiry into Kinkora before 1980. Judge Hughes quickly developed [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6620.68s)]
*  other ideas. On opening his inquiry, he said that what it was about was the administration of boys [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6626.84s)]
*  homes, and that the inquiry would have nothing to do with the allegations carried on in the newspapers [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6633.48s)]
*  and on television, that there was any kind of cover-up of the Kinkora affair, or that there [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6637.8s)]
*  was a vice ring in operation. Hughes refused to interview not only those convicted of offenses [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6642.28s)]
*  against the Kinkora boys, but even Mr. Roy Garland, who had complained to the security forces about [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6648.5199999999995s)]
*  Kinkora as long ago as 1972, and had specifically pointed the finger at William McGrath as the evil [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6654.04s)]
*  genius of the affair. Mr. Robert McCartney, QC, representing the Kinkora boys, could hardly [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6660.679999999999s)]
*  contain himself. Are my wits leaving me? A man who detonated an entire police inquiry and put [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6666.68s)]
*  the finger at a fairly early stage on the man subsequently convicted for some of the most brutal [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6672.92s)]
*  acts of sodomy is not a relevant or material witness? At this point, this already extraordinary [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6677.96s)]
*  story becomes positively surreal. Wallace, asked to give evidence to the Hughes inquiry, agrees to [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6685.88s)]
*  do so only if he's allowed to tell everything, and has granted immunity from prosecution under [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6691.96s)]
*  the Official Secrets Act for doing so. Just to be clear, he's not asking for blanket immunity, [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6696.52s)]
*  he's asking for immunity just for testifying about things that are covered under secrecy laws. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6703.96s)]
*  This is turned down by Mrs. Thatcher personally. Wallace sends a whole file of notes to Number 10 [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6711.72s)]
*  Downing Street for onward transmission to Hughes, but most of the documents mysteriously [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6717.56s)]
*  get stolen by Number 10 and are never supplied to Hughes. The Hughes report is another complete [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6722.360000000001s)]
*  whitewash. Faced with a document from Wallace proving that he had raised the Kinkora question [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6727.72s)]
*  back in 1974, Hughes avers that it might have been a forgery and therefore can be ignored. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6733.0s)]
*  A file of documents on Kinkora is then sent on to Teddy Taylor, the right-wing Tory MP who had [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6739.320000000001s)]
*  shown great interest in the case. Taylor places this file in a locked cupboard in a locked office [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6745.0s)]
*  under a 24-hour-a-day police guard. It is nonetheless stolen, producing a furious [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6751.16s)]
*  complaint from David Owen MP that even the House of Commons is no longer safe from burglary. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6757.56s)]
*  So what's going on in a situation like this? What's going on here? [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6767.72s)]
*  Don't answer that yet. Here's another story also from Britain. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6770.76s)]
*  This is from the Manchester Evening News. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6777.24s)]
*  The Westminster establishment turned a blind eye to child abuse allegations against former [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6780.52s)]
*  Rushdale MP Cyril Smith for decades. A long-awaited national inquiry has found. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6785.8s)]
*  Smith and other high-profile members of parliament were protected from police action by their [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6791.88s)]
*  parties as their whips tried to avoid damaging gossip and scandal. The independent inquiry into [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6797.96s)]
*  child sexual abuse, IICSA, concluded in a damning assessment of political culture spanning years. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6803.32s)]
*  The IICSA inquiry found that both in his case and in those of other suspected MPs, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6810.84s)]
*  including the late conservative Sir Peter Morrison, parties and other institutions effectively [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6817.96s)]
*  covered them up. Professor Alexis J., who chaired the inquiry, said, [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6823.64s)]
*  Smith and others had been abusing children, however. It stated, [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6853.64s)]
*  For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, MPs, including liberal politicians Sir Cyril Smith [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6858.759999999999s)]
*  and Sir Peter Morrison, were found to be active in their sexual interest in children, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6865.96s)]
*  but were protected from prosecution, it found. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6870.599999999999s)]
*  Okay, well, you would be justified in asking. That's end quote. You would be justified in asking [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6875.48s)]
*  what kind of a person, like forget about the perpetrators for a second, what kind of person [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6881.96s)]
*  would cover for someone engaged in the serial sexual abuse of children? It's another part of [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6887.16s)]
*  it that is like, I think, a block to people really getting their arms around this. They just can't [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6894.12s)]
*  imagine that. And I remember I was in high school journalism class many years ago, and on the first [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6899.32s)]
*  day of the class, the teacher, the journalism teacher was giving us all a lecture that was [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6906.44s)]
*  meant to drive home the importance of certain journalistic principles. It was like a big intro. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6910.44s)]
*  Welcome to journalism. And he created a scenario. He said there was once a reporter who had multiple [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6915.4s)]
*  young women independently telling him that they had been raped in the same area of town [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6922.2s)]
*  by a guy with a matching description. He does some homework, corroborates the description, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6927.64s)]
*  homework, corroborates their story, starts writing the story up. Serial rapist, loose on the west [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6934.36s)]
*  side. And so then his phone rings, and it's the police. It's the lead officer pursuing a case [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6940.679999999999s)]
*  against a man that they believe to be the rapist. And he's heard that the reporter was writing a [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6948.92s)]
*  story about it. He talked to the he talked to the victims and they told him that they had been [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6953.639999999999s)]
*  speaking with this reporter. And so the cop has called him to ask for a favor. He said if the [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6959.0s)]
*  reporter runs the story tomorrow, the rapist is going to get spooked. He's going to cover all his [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6963.88s)]
*  tracks. They'll never catch him. And so can you just hold off for a few days while the cops tie up [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6968.52s)]
*  some loose ends and get what they need to actually nail this guy and get him off the street? After [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6975.4800000000005s)]
*  that, he'll have the exclusive on the story. Well, the reporter is a good citizen and he wants to help [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6979.96s)]
*  out. So he agrees. And a week later, sure enough, the cops catch the guy. He admits everything. He's [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6987.72s)]
*  on his way to prison. He publishes his story the same day and lets it be known that he in the paper [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=6993.48s)]
*  cooperated with law enforcement by delaying publication. The next day is at his desk [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7000.12s)]
*  when a woman approaches and asks if he's the reporter who wrote that story. And he says he is. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7007.16s)]
*  And she starts cursing at him and crying and says that in the days after you decided to delay your [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7013.5599999999995s)]
*  story, that man raped me. And I might have avoided that if you had done your job of letting the public [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7018.92s)]
*  know something as basic as the fact that there was a rapist prowling around the neighborhood. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7025.32s)]
*  My teacher wanted to drive home the idea that a journalist stands outside of all political and [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7032.04s)]
*  judicial and even safety and national security concerns, that their God is not peace or justice [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7037.88s)]
*  or safety. Their only God is truth. That's the message he was pushing to us. He wanted us to [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7045.8s)]
*  understand journalism as an almost sacred calling that must be taken deadly seriously if an open [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7051.96s)]
*  society is going to be possible. Well, so he put this question to us, what would we have done in [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7059.56s)]
*  that situation? And he told us, he asked us that question before he kind of told us the punchline [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7067.0s)]
*  at the very end. And you find that your instincts can kind of betray you on that question. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7074.04s)]
*  And I can't remember how I answered when he put the question to us, but for sure, a lot of the [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7080.2s)]
*  students said that they would have helped the cops by delaying the story for understandable reasons. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7084.599999999999s)]
*  But the thing we're talking about here, this is much less understandable. We're talking about [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7091.0s)]
*  something several levels beneath that. Something that's much harder for normal people to relate to. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7097.719999999999s)]
*  And put yourself in that position where you're in some position of responsibility. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7103.48s)]
*  You know, you're a journalist at a major newspaper, TV network, or you're a police officer [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7109.639999999999s)]
*  or intelligence official or some official with oversight over some given area. And you learn [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7114.919999999999s)]
*  about systematic child sexual abuse taking place somewhere, but you're told to drop the issue and [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7121.879999999999s)]
*  that there will be consequences for you if you keep on it. And we've all got families to feed. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7128.2s)]
*  None of us wants to be fired. But I just can't imagine that there are many people listening [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7135.72s)]
*  right now who are not pretty confident that you would refuse to stay quiet about it. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7141.4s)]
*  We're not talking about embezzling funds here. We're not even talking about leaking secrets to [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7147.48s)]
*  a foreign country. We're talking about raping little children. And so we, regular people, [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7152.2s)]
*  consider the issue and we think, I don't really think there's a single person that I consider a [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7161.639999999999s)]
*  friend who would go along with this. And yet, for some reason, there always seems to be plenty of [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7167.16s)]
*  people willing to go along with it concentrated among government officials, teachers, unions, [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7176.84s)]
*  and school officials, high ranking law enforcement and intelligence officials, major media figures. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7183.72s)]
*  This is from BuzzFeed News. This was published just a few weeks ago, actually, in December 2021. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7193.4800000000005s)]
*  Quote, secret CIA files say staffers committed sex crimes involving children. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7200.2s)]
*  Declassified CIA Inspector General reports show a pattern of abuse and a repeated decision by [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7207.64s)]
*  federal prosecutors not to hold agency personnel accountable. Over the past 14 years, the Central [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7213.72s)]
*  Intelligence Agency has secretly amassed credible evidence that at least 10 of its employees and [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7221.16s)]
*  contractors committed sexual crimes involving children, but only one of the individuals was [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7226.28s)]
*  ever charged with a crime. Prosecutors sent the rest of the cases back to the CIA to handle [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7232.36s)]
*  internally, meaning few faced any consequences beyond the possible loss of their jobs and [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7238.44s)]
*  security clearances. That marks a striking deviation from how sex crimes involving children [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7243.88s)]
*  have been handled at other federal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7249.5599999999995s)]
*  Drug Enforcement Administration. CIA insiders say the agency resists prosecution of its staff [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7254.28s)]
*  for fear the cases will reveal state secrets. End quote. How exactly would prosecuting a pedophile [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7262.12s)]
*  risk revealing state secrets? They don't say. If a pedophile works at McDonald's, prosecuting him [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7271.48s)]
*  is not going to risk divulging the secret to making McDonald's fries so good. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7277.719999999999s)]
*  Were these people engaged in their mission at the time that they were committing these crimes [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7284.599999999999s)]
*  against children? Did the abuse have something to do with their work for the CIA? If not, then what [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7288.84s)]
*  the hell? Throw them out of the agency, hand them over to a prosecutor and put them in prison. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7295.4s)]
*  How does that endanger state secrets? [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7301.8s)]
*  The fact that they're so resistant to putting them on the stand or holding a trial and having [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7306.679999999999s)]
*  discovery is, I say, pretty solid proof that we're not talking about janitors and food service [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7311.8s)]
*  workers here, but CIA employees engaged in sensitive intelligence work. This is at an [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7318.12s)]
*  organization where they are very sensitive to the possibility of their employees being vulnerable [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7324.28s)]
*  to bribery or blackmail. You get kicked out of the CIA if your credit score drops too low, [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7329.56s)]
*  or if you owe too much money or you get popped on a drug test. Your clearance is suspended or revoked [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7334.92s)]
*  and you're out of there. And yet there are what? 10, 12, maybe more CIA employees engaged in serious [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7340.92s)]
*  offenses against children and it gets swept under the rug. How are there so many? The CIA is not [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7349.88s)]
*  that big of an organization. And these were not minor offenses, not that any offense against a [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7355.56s)]
*  child's minor. These are very serious. Quote, one employee had sexual contact with a two-year-old [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7360.92s)]
*  and a six-year-old. He was fired. A second employee purchased three sexually explicit videos of young [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7367.16s)]
*  girls filmed by their mothers. He resigned. A third employee estimated that he had viewed up to 1,400 [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7374.2s)]
*  sexually abusive images of children while on agency assignments. The records do not say what action, [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7382.76s)]
*  if any, the CIA took against him. A contractor who arranged for sex with an undercover FBI agent [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7389.5599999999995s)]
*  posing as a child had his contract revoked. Only one of the individuals cited in these documents [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7396.92s)]
*  was charged with a crime. In that case, as in the only previous known case of a CIA staffer being [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7403.32s)]
*  charged with sexual crimes, the employee was also under investigation for mishandling classified [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7410.68s)]
*  material. End quote. So the one employee who was actually charged with a crime was already in [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7417.88s)]
*  trouble for something else and they just decided to pile on. Quote, four former officials who are [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7423.16s)]
*  familiar with how internal investigations work at intelligence agencies told BuzzFeed News there [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7429.08s)]
*  are many reasons that prosecutors might not pursue a criminal case. One of them, familiar with the [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7434.68s)]
*  workings of the CIA's Office of Inspector General, said the agency is concerned that in a criminal [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7440.36s)]
*  case it could lose control of sensitive information. The former official who reviewed the declassified [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7445.88s)]
*  Inspector General reports characterized the concern from CIA lawyers as, we can't have these [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7452.92s)]
*  people testify. They may inadvertently be forced to disclose sources and methods. The official who [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7459.16s)]
*  noted the agency has had a problem with child abuse images stretching back decades said they [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7466.84s)]
*  understand the need to protect sensitive and classified equities. However, for crimes of a [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7474.36s)]
*  certain class, whether it's an intelligence agency or not, you just have to figure out how to [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7479.72s)]
*  prosecute these people. End quote. And quote, sexual crimes involving children, including the [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7484.4400000000005s)]
*  viewing of images of abuse, have been uncovered at other agencies that handle sensitive information. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7492.84s)]
*  In a November 2009 report, the Department of Defense acknowledged that dozens of Pentagon [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7498.4400000000005s)]
*  staff members or contractors had such images. In 2014, the Inspector General of the intelligence [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7503.96s)]
*  community found that two officials from the National Reconnaissance Office, which oversees [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7510.28s)]
*  America's spy satellites, acknowledged viewing images of child sexual abuse during polygraph [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7514.84s)]
*  examinations. At a symposium in 2016, Daniel Payne, a top Pentagon security official, said that when [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7520.68s)]
*  workers' computers were examined, quote, the amount of child porn I see is just unbelievable. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7528.68s)]
*  End quote. So you remember at the beginning of the previous episode when I said I just wanted to [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7535.88s)]
*  make one request from the regime, from the people in power, and I understand it's difficult and I [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7547.240000000001s)]
*  don't expect a lot, so I'm really trying to limit my request to something realistic. Is it [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7555.96s)]
*  too much to ask that we don't have dozens or more pedophiles working in sensitive positions [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7561.64s)]
*  at the Pentagon and the CIA? Now, how does that happen? There are minimalist and maximalist [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7568.76s)]
*  theories on what's going on in a situation like the one at the Kinkora Boys Home in Northern Ireland. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7577.0s)]
*  And certainly the evidence, which admittedly is circumstantial, but I talked about that in the [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7583.4s)]
*  previous episode, things are going to be circumstantial here. Documents are destroyed, [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7589.4800000000005s)]
*  hidden, classified. You're dealing with an entire organization full of people who are committed to [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7594.6s)]
*  secrecy and misinformation. This stuff's going to be circumstantial. But the weight of circumstantial [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7600.4400000000005s)]
*  evidence indicates that a guy connected to British intelligence and his staff were [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7610.52s)]
*  systematically abusing children at this boy's home, that the boys were being pimped out to [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7617.0s)]
*  outsiders, that several victims as well as intelligence whistleblowers have said that [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7622.92s)]
*  the crimes involved important people in Britain and Northern Ireland, and that there was a [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7629.64s)]
*  concerted effort from multiple vectors to keep a lid on all of it as much as possible. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7634.92s)]
*  That's pretty well established. Now, some people take that information and jump to [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7640.92s)]
*  British intelligence must have been running a brutally abusive orphanage for the specific [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7646.52s)]
*  purpose of catching prominent Irish and British citizens in compromising situations so that they [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7651.96s)]
*  can discredit or control them with blackmail. And maybe that's true. I don't put anything past them. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7656.76s)]
*  But I think maybe a more likely scenario, one that you could maybe sell to a skeptic, [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7663.88s)]
*  where they were, you know, basically these intelligence agencies discovered that the abuse [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7670.52s)]
*  was happening. They saw that there were prominent people involved. And when reports started to float [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7676.68s)]
*  up to decision makers, they didn't say, you know, why you can't prosecute him. He's our pedophile. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7683.160000000001s)]
*  They probably said, Look, look, look, we know we get it. It's disgusting. And we hate this too. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7689.0s)]
*  But we're in the middle of an investigation right now. We're running down leads on some [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7694.6s)]
*  very important people coming through here. We've heard, you know, some people in the place, [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7698.2s)]
*  we've placed surveillance on them. And, you know, we've heard them talk about several important [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7703.08s)]
*  people who have like come through here as abusers before. And we don't want to show we, you know, [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7708.2s)]
*  we've heard they might be coming back and we want to catch them. Don't you want to catch these [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7712.92s)]
*  people? You know, that kind of thing. And they say, we promise as soon as we get what we need. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7716.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we're right behind you ready to arrest these animals. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7720.92s)]
*  You see, it's got a cop movies all the time, and I assume versions of it happen in real life. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7724.68s)]
*  You know, local cops have some drug dealer dead to rights. And the FBI or DEA comes in and says, [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7728.84s)]
*  no, no, no, we've got a big multi-state investigation going. And, you know, they're [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7735.24s)]
*  going to change all the patterns we've learned, change out all the phones we've tapped, everything. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7741.96s)]
*  If you let them know that we're on to him just to bust this nobody. And so you need to be careful [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7746.2s)]
*  nobody. And so you need to back off. Whitey Bolger, the Irish mobster up in Boston, [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7751.4s)]
*  he was an FBI informant for years, very famously, and they literally let him get away with murder, [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7759.5599999999995s)]
*  as long as he kept providing them with a stream of information on other things. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7765.48s)]
*  In these situations, it's not like the investigators or the intelligence agents [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7771.879999999999s)]
*  are necessarily cool with what's going on. They're just able to convince themselves that [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7777.96s)]
*  this criminal activity is less important than some bigger fish that they're trying to fry. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7784.12s)]
*  When you're talking about drug dealers, it might just be, you know, legit tactic to hold off on [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7790.04s)]
*  the street dealer if you think he might lead you to the distributor. But consider the overall [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7795.96s)]
*  political situation in Britain and Northern Ireland at the time. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7802.04s)]
*  And these were years where pretty much everybody in the Harold Wilson cabinet says that MI5 was [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7805.08s)]
*  off the reservation running information operations against the government that it was supposed to be [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7811.24s)]
*  serving. They had investigators on politicians that they considered unfriendly, and they were [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7816.12s)]
*  scraping the bottom of the barrel for rumors and accusations against British politicians to air in [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7824.6s)]
*  the press. And so when we learn that during this same period of time, the agencies who were engaged [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7829.72s)]
*  in those operations were being notified that important people were engaging in sex crimes at [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7835.0s)]
*  a boy's home and that they ignored that information and even attacked the people who were bringing [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7840.2s)]
*  that information to them, then that is some circumstantial evidence, you know, to put the [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7844.92s)]
*  onus on the defenders of MI5 and military intelligence to make their case. They've abused [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7850.360000000001s)]
*  whistleblowers, hidden information, lied and thrown up controlled investigations that avoid all [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7858.28s)]
*  questions about agency involvement or cover up. There's a somewhat different version of this kind [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7866.04s)]
*  of minimalist theory that seems to have been at play, I think, in a lot of famous cases in the US [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7873.4800000000005s)]
*  over the years. I don't know how many of you have read the book Chaos by Tom O'Neill came out in [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7880.28s)]
*  2019. It's a fascinating book where he documents his investigation, 20-year-long investigation, [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7886.68s)]
*  into the crimes of the Manson family. And there's just no way that you can come away from that book [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7893.320000000001s)]
*  thinking that we know everything about what happened with those Manson murders. I'll just [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7902.360000000001s)]
*  leave it at that. You don't have to believe the maximalist alternatives, like Charles Manson was [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7907.16s)]
*  a CIA asset who killed those people as part of his mission from the CIA. You don't have to believe [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7912.2s)]
*  that. But O'Neill demonstrates pretty definitively that the story everybody reads in Bugliosi's [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7917.08s)]
*  Helter Skelter, you know, the canonical book on the Manson family is just not true. He shows that [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7923.48s)]
*  Manson was in close long-term contact with men who were involved for many years. For sure, this is not [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7930.5199999999995s)]
*  even speculative. He establishes this. Manson was in close long-term contact for many years with guys [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7938.12s)]
*  who were involved with the CIA mind control program known as MKUltra. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7945.96s)]
*  You know, it was focused on plumbing the depths of the human psyche using hypnosis and drugs and [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7952.36s)]
*  other techniques in order to learn more about mind control and psychological warfare. O'Neill shows [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7957.5599999999995s)]
*  that Charles Manson is continually let off the hook after being caught with drugs, illegal weapons, [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7963.4s)]
*  stolen cars, underage girls, underage girls who are drunk and high despite the fact that the entire [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7971.5599999999995s)]
*  time he's on parole and that his parole officer somehow only managed one parolee, Manson himself, [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7979.48s)]
*  while most of his colleagues managed 30 or 40 parolees, and that that parole officer had [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7988.84s)]
*  intelligence connections, and that after Manson moved to San Francisco during the Summer of Love, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=7995.0s)]
*  the parole officer quit being a parole officer and went to work in the government-funded clinic where [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8001.0s)]
*  Manson and his family visited, were visiting every week. This was during a time when intelligence [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8005.639999999999s)]
*  agencies and law enforcement were very interested in the effects these new drugs were having on [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8012.12s)]
*  people. And so one of the things they did, you can read about this in O'Neill's book as well as [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8017.08s)]
*  other places, is that they set up drug houses around the Haight-Ashbury Park where all the hippies [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8021.48s)]
*  were based in in 67, and it was just ground zero really for hippie-dom in these years. And they [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8029.24s)]
*  set up these drug houses with secret rooms and one-way mirrors, and they got grad student research [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8035.88s)]
*  assistants who would go into these places. They were recruited to help with a study, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8042.84s)]
*  and their job was to basically just go out, find people, bring them into the house, and give them [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8047.16s)]
*  drugs so that the observers in the secret compartments behind the one-way mirrors could [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8052.360000000001s)]
*  watch what happened. And the students keep complaining as the project goes on because they [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8057.64s)]
*  they keep saying they don't really know what it is that they're doing or what the point of any of [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8064.92s)]
*  this research is because it seems like they're just watching people get high and party. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8069.64s)]
*  So all this is going on, and you have a clinic with at least two employees connected to the CIA, [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8074.4400000000005s)]
*  both of them are focused on specifically on scientific work studying the effects of various [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8080.4400000000005s)]
*  drugs on human behavior, especially aggressive behavior. And Manson and his family are visiting [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8085.96s)]
*  this place every week during their formative period. He keeps getting arrested with stuff [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8095.48s)]
*  that should be an automatic felony, automatic parole violation, but he's always let off. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8101.0s)]
*  The LA County Sheriff's Office raided the ranch where the Manson family was staying after the [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8106.599999999999s)]
*  Manson murders took place. During the raid they found illegal weapons, drugs, underage girls, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8112.759999999999s)]
*  stolen cars, you name it, and despite pulling together the resources from one of the largest [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8120.2s)]
*  operations in the history of the LA County Sheriff's Department at the time, they decided [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8124.6s)]
*  to just let everybody go. And so you say what's going on here? Manson definitely had cover from [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8129.240000000001s)]
*  somewhere, and it was somewhere with enough juice to tell the LA County Sheriff that he's just going [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8136.52s)]
*  to have to eat the cost of this giant raid and look like a fool for ordering such a major operation [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8143.160000000001s)]
*  that resulted in no charges. Someone with the weight to tell the California criminal justice [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8148.44s)]
*  system that the normal rules regarding parole violation don't apply to this guy. Normal people [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8155.4s)]
*  get violated just for not checking in or for not holding down a steady job while they're on parole [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8161.799999999999s)]
*  or for leaving the city that they're living in without permission. Manson's caught with drugs, [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8168.36s)]
*  guns, little girls in a stolen car hundreds of miles from where he's approved to be and nothing [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8173.48s)]
*  happens. Now does this mean that Manson was a CIA agent? No. The CIA employs pedophiles, but even [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8178.679999999999s)]
*  they seem to have their limits. Does it mean that the CIA created Manson in an MK Ultra lab just so [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8188.599999999999s)]
*  he could go off the rails and do something that would discredit the hippie movement? This is one [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8194.92s)]
*  of the popular theories. If that had been their plan, they couldn't have done it much better, [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8198.84s)]
*  but maybe not. But what it might mean is that Manson was being monitored by people who were [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8204.12s)]
*  interested in seeing how his drug-fueled mind control experiment would develop in the wild. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8211.24s)]
*  People with enough pull to get Manson flagged as do not arrest until they lost interest in him, [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8217.8s)]
*  and that at some point they lost track of him and he went on a rampage. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8223.72s)]
*  When they woke up that morning and realized what had happened, [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8229.8s)]
*  they said to each other, no, nobody can find out about this. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8234.28s)]
*  Although sometimes I have to say it can be hard to restrict myself to the minimalist version of some [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8241.48s)]
*  of these conspiracy theories. Like one over in Belgium a few years back. Sleepy little [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8246.68s)]
*  peaceful Belgium when they're not extracting resources from the Congo. Something called the [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8252.68s)]
*  Dutro affair. A guy named Mark Dutro. Europeans are usually familiar with this. Americans often [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8259.0s)]
*  are not. It's a really chilling and horrible story. Mark Dutro was a serial killer, a rapist, [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8266.04s)]
*  and a pedophile arrested in Belgium in 1996. He had left home at 15 years old, [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8273.24s)]
*  drifting around homeless, supporting himself by prostitution. He married a woman when he was 20, [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8281.8s)]
*  but he beat and cheated on her. So that didn't last long. And in 1987, when he's 31 years old, [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8289.08s)]
*  he gets picked up by the police for the suspected kidnapping and rape of several young girls in [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8295.24s)]
*  recent years. One of his victims told police that Dutro was not a lone actor, but that he was part [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8300.28s)]
*  of a gang led by two gang leaders, an Italian one and a crazy stupid one. And so soon police had [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8307.960000000001s)]
*  custody of one of these accomplices who admitted to kidnapping two of the girls with Mark Dutro [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8317.0s)]
*  and another person, a woman who wasn't caught at the time. The two girls were never found. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8322.44s)]
*  In June of 1985, the gang kidnapped an 11 year old and a few months later, they grabbed a 19 year old. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8330.92s)]
*  Three months after that, they take another girl who's 18 years old [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8341.24s)]
*  and they continue this. They abduct more girls, rape them, take lewd pictures and video of them. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8345.320000000002s)]
*  In February of 87, it's when they're arrested, convicted, and they're put in jail. And in jail, [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8353.24s)]
*  Dutro convinced someone that he deserved disability due to mental health problems. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8359.24s)]
*  And so he starts receiving a $1,200 a month disability stipend courtesy of the Belgian [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8364.92s)]
*  taxpayer, an arrangement which would continue after his release, which happened after just [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8369.08s)]
*  a few short years. Because despite the protests of the prosecutor on the case and the adamant [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8374.44s)]
*  opposition of the prison psychiatrist who had examined Dutro and determined him to be unstable [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8381.16s)]
*  and highly dangerous, the Belgian minister of justice overruled every other interested [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8388.04s)]
*  party and ordered early release for this, this, this, this man, Mark Dutro. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8393.480000000001s)]
*  Fast forward a few years to 1995 near Liege, two eight year old girls, classmates [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8400.84s)]
*  are walking home when they're kidnapped. Mark Dutro took these two girls to one of his homes. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8409.0s)]
*  He had seven homes. Some, some sources say he had 10 homes and a lot of money in the bank. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8417.48s)]
*  You know, he had gone from being a drifter and never having a job to being independently wealthy [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8424.28s)]
*  and nobody knows how he got his money. So he brings the girls to one of his homes where he's [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8428.84s)]
*  constructed a dungeon in the basement and chains them up. Again, it's hard for us regular people to [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8434.2s)]
*  imagine that people like this exist, but they do exist. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8441.16s)]
*  Two months later, two of the Dutro gang kidnapped two more girls, brought them back to the house. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8445.56s)]
*  And since the dungeons were holding the eight year old, these two new abductees were putting [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8453.8s)]
*  chains in one of the bedrooms. Dutro and the rest of the group tortured and sexually abused [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8458.12s)]
*  these girls for months. And then the two more recent victims were drugged. One day [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8466.28s)]
*  they were taken to another location and killed by Mark Dutro who buried them alive actually. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8473.720000000001s)]
*  So at this point, there's some intro group drama among the kidnappers. And in the last month of [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8480.92s)]
*  1995, Dutro is arrested again for something to do with a stolen car. And he's held for four months [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8485.400000000001s)]
*  until March of 96 when he returned home to find that the two eight year old girls in the dungeon [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8491.24s)]
*  had starved to death in his absence. His wife, who was an elementary school teacher, [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8498.28s)]
*  admitted that she knew the two girls were in prison down there and that she had gone to that [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8506.44s)]
*  property every day to feed the dogs while Dutro was in jail, but did not give the girls any food [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8511.48s)]
*  or water and let them die. When he got back and found them dead, Dutro buried their bodies on the [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8516.84s)]
*  property. Two months later, he and an accomplice kidnap a 12 year old girl who's thrown in the [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8524.12s)]
*  dungeon, beaten, starved, raped. Six weeks later, Dutro and an accomplice kidnap another girl who's [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8530.12s)]
*  14 years old while she's walking home from a swimming pool. And this time an eyewitness saw [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8540.12s)]
*  her get pulled into a van and she was able to take down the license plate. And so a few days later, [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8545.56s)]
*  Dutro and his accomplice are arrested and very soon they confess. Dutro told the authorities about [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8549.8s)]
*  the dungeon and they were able to get the two imprisoned girls in time and to rescue them. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8556.76s)]
*  They'd been in the dungeon chained by the neck for 79 days. Dutro led police to bodies buried in [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8562.519999999999s)]
*  three locations. In his properties, police found hundreds of homemade pornographic videos, including [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8569.56s)]
*  many of them involving the abuse of children. And what happened next is what turned this criminal [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8577.48s)]
*  case into an affair, into the Dutro affair, one of the great public scandals in Belgian history, and [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8586.84s)]
*  eventually brought 300,000 Belgian protesters out into the streets. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8593.56s)]
*  The name Dutro is so toxic. It's like, it's like Hitler or something like, you know, one in three [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8599.4s)]
*  Belgians who had that name, Dutro, had it legally changed after this, just to avoid the association. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8605.88s)]
*  In court, Marc Dutro's attorney didn't deny any of the crimes that he was accused of. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8614.199999999999s)]
*  But, he said, Marc Dutro had not acted alone. He was part of a child trafficking ring that included [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8620.04s)]
*  important Belgian citizens, and also his lawyer said that his kidnappings were often done with [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8627.960000000001s)]
*  help from the police. Dutro's accomplice told police that the kidnappings had not been spur of [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8635.0s)]
*  the moment, but that the girls were taken for other people who were paying customers. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8644.2s)]
*  One prominent Belgian that Dutro named as an accomplice was a wealthy businessman named Michel [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8648.28s)]
*  Niho, who Dutro claimed was his conduit to a network of wealthy and prominent pedophiles in [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8654.2s)]
*  Belgium. A reporter for The Guardian in the UK interviewed Niho and was told with confidence [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8660.2s)]
*  that the case would never go to trial. The article says, he is confident that he will never come to [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8667.640000000001s)]
*  trial and that the evidence against him is not going to be found. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8672.68s)]
*  He will never come to court, he said, because the information he has about important people in Belgium [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8676.52s)]
*  would bring the government down. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8686.6s)]
*  Well, the Belgian public soon learned why he was so confident, as the criminal justice system [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8691.4s)]
*  began to do everything possible apparently to screw up the case. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8697.640000000001s)]
*  News reports tell us that the early investigators on the case believed Dutro was tied into a larger [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8702.519999999999s)]
*  human trafficking network with many other accomplices. The judge who was assigned to the case believed that. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8709.0s)]
*  Judge Jean-Marc Connery was his name and he came to believe that this other guy Michel [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8716.119999999999s)]
*  Niho, the wealthy businessman, was the brains behind the operation and that Dutro was just a henchman. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8722.76s)]
*  And so he made a public call for this judge made a public call for other victims to come forward and [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8727.96s)]
*  some did. This is more from that Guardian piece. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8733.48s)]
*  She told investigators how from the age of 12, she'd been given by her parents to a family friend, [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8757.64s)]
*  Tony Vandenbergert, who had a key to their house. He would collect her from school and take her away [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8764.279999999999s)]
*  for weekends to sex parties where she was given to other men and secretly filmed having sex with them. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8770.599999999999s)]
*  It was highly organized, she says. Big business, blackmail. There was a lot of money involved. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8776.92s)]
*  In 1996, she related her experiences to a police team under carefully filmed and supervised [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8783.0s)]
*  conditions. She described certain regular clients, including judges, one of the country's most powerful [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8790.44s)]
*  politicians, now dead, and a prominent banker. She gave the police the names by which she knew these men, [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8796.52s)]
*  detailed the houses, apartments, and districts where she'd been taken and with other children [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8803.320000000002s)]
*  to entertain the guests. The entertainment was not just sex, she told police. It involved sadism, [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8808.92s)]
*  torture, and even murder. And again, she described the places, the victims, and the ways they were [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8815.64s)]
*  killed. One of the regular organizers of these parties, she claimed, was the man she knew as Miesh, [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8821.88s)]
*  Jean-Michel Niho. A very cruel man. He abused children in a very sadistic way, she said. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8828.6s)]
*  Also there, she said, was the young Dutreux. Dutreux was a boy who brought drugs, cocaine, [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8836.039999999999s)]
*  to these parties. He brought some girls, watched girls. At these events, Niho was sort of a party [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8841.64s)]
*  beast, while Dutreux was more on the side. Louvre's testimony was vitally important. If true, [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8847.4s)]
*  it placed Dutreux and Niho, suspected accomplices in the latest child abductions, together at the [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8854.28s)]
*  scene of similar crimes 10 years before. Police began to check her story, but then something [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8860.44s)]
*  changed." All of a sudden, the judge, Connerop, was removed from the case by order of someone [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8866.68s)]
*  very high in the establishment, and he was replaced by a judge who had never presided [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8875.32s)]
*  over a case before. This was his first time. In 2009, someone with access to the case leaked [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8880.68s)]
*  documents having to do with the Dutreux investigation to WikiLeaks, who vetted the [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8888.6s)]
*  information and then put it out into the world. The writer Elizabeth Voss describes the content [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8894.36s)]
*  of these WikiLeaks revelations, quote, In 2009, WikiLeaks provided further information regarding [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8902.6s)]
*  the case via their publication of the Dutreux dossier. Belgian authorities later attempted, [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8909.4s)]
*  unsuccessfully, to force WikiLeaks to remove the Belgian dossier. WikiLeaks summarized the [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8915.0s)]
*  Dutreux case. Dutreux was a figure in the European criminal underworld, and the case had connections [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8920.52s)]
*  to other underworld figures, to police corruption, and from there to Belgian political figures. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8926.04s)]
*  WikiLeaks' Dutreux dossier shows large financial transactions, maps of numerous European countries, [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8932.6s)]
*  and the presence of international currencies, including those of Morocco and Saudi Arabia. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8939.32s)]
*  The dossier shows payments of hundreds of thousands of francs to Michel Martin, [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8944.359999999999s)]
*  Dutreux's ex-wife, and to Dutreux's personal bank account. It appears to be a reasonable [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8948.84s)]
*  inference from these documents that Marc Dutreux and Michel Nijol were not acting alone in their [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8954.359999999999s)]
*  criminal enterprises, end quote. Voss describes how the initial crime scene investigation found [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8959.72s)]
*  many, many semen samples and hundreds of human hairs down in that dungeon, which didn't match [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8968.279999999999s)]
*  Dutreux or any of his other arrested accomplices. These are unknown people, but the samples are [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8975.4s)]
*  never analyzed beyond that. So you have a serial killer sex dungeon. Both the killer and his [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8979.96s)]
*  accomplices tell police that more people are involved, but they're not interested in analyzing [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8987.08s)]
*  unaccounted for semen and hair samples from the scene to figure out who some of those other [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8993.08s)]
*  people might be. I'm not a detective, but I've watched a lot of cop movies. I'm pretty sure [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=8997.32s)]
*  that's not normal. Voss continues about the WikiLeaks content, quote, [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9002.52s)]
*  much as in the lack of analysis of DNA material recovered from Dutreux's basement, [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9008.28s)]
*  the lack of investigation into Marc Dutreux's financial connections increased frustration [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9013.56s)]
*  over an appallingly inefficient legal procedure. Marc Dutreux was an electrician living on social [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9018.52s)]
*  security benefits during the time of the crimes, but nonetheless owned 10 houses. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9025.08s)]
*  The New York Times wrote on this point, after several of the disappearances, Mr. Dutreux paid [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9030.36s)]
*  large sums of money into several bank accounts, with four years of being released early from jail [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9035.4s)]
*  where he had served time for rape and kidnapping. Mr. Dutreux, whose only official income was a [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9041.88s)]
*  welfare check, was worth an estimated six million francs, which is about $1.2, $1.3 million in 95, [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9047.16s)]
*  suggesting to investigators that he was acting for others higher up in a pedophile and prostitution [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9056.36s)]
*  ring, end quote. That's the New York Times. So we're just getting started here. Many of the [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9062.36s)]
*  police assigned to the case seem singularly uninterested in actually solving it. And those [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9068.2s)]
*  who are interested in solving it start to disappear or be taken off the case. More from Voss, quote, [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9076.28s)]
*  the investigation was also mired by an unusually high number of deaths in relation to the scandal. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9084.2s)]
*  These included the son of a judge, police officers, and even the chief prosecutor overseeing the case. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9090.04s)]
*  The Guardian reported, since Dutreux's arrest, 20 potential witnesses connected with the case have [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9097.0s)]
*  died in mysterious circumstances, fueling suspicions of a cover-up reaching the highest levels. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9103.32s)]
*  The Guardian added that important evidence has also disappeared. The New York Times reported on [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9109.56s)]
*  the death of Hubert Massa, who served as the chief prosecuting attorney in Liège and was in charge of [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9115.24s)]
*  the investigation into the alleged pedophile murders committed by Marc Dutreux. Massa was also [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9121.0s)]
*  the lead investigator of the 1991 gangland-style slang of Andre Cools, the socialist party boss in [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9127.08s)]
*  Wallonia. Massa's death during the Dutreux case was termed a suicide. The main suspect in the [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9133.96s)]
*  Cools case also committed suicide, end quote. Unlikely, suicides are not just an American [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9140.12s)]
*  political tradition, continuing on, quote, revelations of corruption resulting from Cool's [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9148.12s)]
*  death led to the disgrace of Willy Claes, a Belgian statesman and secretary general of NATO. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9155.0s)]
*  Claes resigned from his leadership position after he was found guilty of corruption. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9161.0s)]
*  The witness in the Dutreux investigation, known as X3, further identified Willy Claes as one of those [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9165.48s)]
*  present during alleged torture, sexual abuse, and murder of children. The Washington Post also [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9171.88s)]
*  speculated that there may have been a connection between the Cools case and that of Dutreux. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9178.36s)]
*  The New York Times reported on the death of a son of a police officer involved with investigating [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9183.24s)]
*  Dutreux. Judge Poncelet's son, a police officer, was involved in another case in which Mr. Dutreux [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9188.28s)]
*  is implicated. He was investigating the trafficking of stolen cars in 1996 when he was shot and killed [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9194.36s)]
*  in an unsolved murder. The Irish Times and other media noted strange deaths among witnesses tied [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9200.76s)]
*  to the Dutreux case, describing how Bruna Tugliaferro, a scrap merchant who planned to [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9207.56s)]

*  A sex club owner associated with kneehole was shot to death. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9219.16s)]
*  Jean van Pedigum, one of Dutreux's early accomplices, was yet another death associated [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9223.24s)]
*  with the investigation. He had spoken to authorities regarding his involvement with Mark Dutreux. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9228.279999999999s)]
*  According to European reports, he died when his moped crashed into a bus. Dutreux also [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9234.279999999999s)]
*  admitted murdering another accomplice, Bernard Weinstein. The many deaths surrounding the Dutreux [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9239.96s)]
*  scandal fueled concerns that Dutreux was part of a larger pedophile network that had gone unpunished. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9245.56s)]
*  Well, I can't get any worse than that, right? Wrong. This is the journalist Ambrose Evans [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9253.24s)]
*  Pritchard of the UK Daily Telegraph in 2004. The Belgian judge who saved two girls from Mark [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9259.64s)]
*  Dutreux's pedophile dungeon broke down in the witness box yesterday, alleging high-level murder [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9267.48s)]
*  plots to stop his investigation into a child sex mafia. Jean-Marc Conneral choked in tears on the [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9272.84s)]
*  fourth day of the trial, describing the bulletproof vehicles and armed guards needed to protect him [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9279.16s)]
*  against shadowy figures determined to stop the full truth coming out. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9284.2s)]
*  Never before in Belgium has an investigating judge at the service of the Queen been subjected to such [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9289.0s)]
*  pressure, he said. We were told by police that murder contracts had been taken out against the [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9294.28s)]
*  magistrates. As the danger mounted, emergency measures were taken. Then he froze in silence, [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9299.640000000001s)]
*  and the court was adjourned until he recovered. He alleged that organized crime methods were used [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9306.44s)]
*  to discredit his investigation and to ensure that it ended in judicial failure. A hero to millions [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9312.84s)]
*  of Belgians, Judge Conneral was stripped of the Dutreux case after he had dinner with families of [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9319.32s)]
*  the victims in October 1996, which was deemed a conflict of interest. And to be clear, [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9325.24s)]
*  he didn't go out to dinner with the victims' families. He attended an event that was raising [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9334.2s)]
*  money for the victims and their families. That was declared to be a conflict of interest, [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9340.2s)]
*  and the higher-ups used it as an excuse to pull him off the case and assign this new judge who [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9345.320000000002s)]
*  never supervised an investigation before. What makes it worse is that another judge assigned to [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9349.880000000001s)]
*  the case had close personal ties to Michel Nihal. As a lawyer, he'd represented Nihal's wife, [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9355.800000000001s)]
*  and his sister was godmother to Michel Nihal's child. That was not declared a conflict of [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9363.64s)]
*  interest. That judge was not removed from the case, but Judge Conneral was removed from the case [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9370.76s)]
*  for a conflict of interest arising from attending a fundraising dinner for victims. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9376.359999999999s)]
*  The removal of Judge Conneral resulted in workers going on strike and 300,000 people marching [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9382.439999999999s)]
*  silently through Brussels in mass protest. Seven years later, for reasons that have no [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9387.96s)]
*  satisfactory explanation, it was seven years before Dutreux actually went to trial, some of [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9393.4s)]
*  the families are boycotting the trial, describing it as a circus and saying that the inquiry [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9399.08s)]
*  effectively shut down the moment Judge Conneral departed. Addressing the jury of 12 at the Arlan [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9403.64s)]
*  Palais de Justice yesterday, Judge Conneral relived the moment in August 1996 when his team rescued [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9409.88s)]
*  the two girls, Sabine Darden, 12, and Letitia Delez, 14, from the cage beneath Dutreux's house [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9416.6s)]
*  in the slums of Charleroi. He said the girls recoiled back into the cell when the 450-pound [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9423.720000000001s)]
*  hidden door was pulled open, fearing that the pedophile band had come to get them. As Dutreux [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9429.960000000001s)]
*  coaxed them out, saying there was nothing to fear, they clutched onto him as their protector. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9436.68s)]
*  He says they thanked and embraced him, which is truly disgusting, Judge Conneral says. That shows [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9442.039999999999s)]
*  how far they had been conditioned. It was Machiavellian. In January 1996, Judge Conneral [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9447.56s)]
*  wrote to King Albert alleging that his investigations into crime networks were being [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9454.36s)]
*  blocked because suspects apparently enjoyed serious protection. He went on to say that the [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9458.28s)]
*  dysfunctional judiciary was breaking down as mafia groups took secret control of key institutions of [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9463.8s)]
*  the country. That sounds a little crazy, right? I mean, what are we talking about here? One or [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9470.52s)]
*  two perverts is one thing to believe, but how widespread and powerful a group of people are [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9480.2s)]
*  we supposed to be talking about here? One, powerful enough not only to threaten witnesses [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9485.640000000001s)]
*  and judges, but also enough to put the lid on an attempt to investigate this by the Belgian [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9491.4s)]
*  Parliament. The chairman of a parliamentary inquiry that was set up to look into the [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9496.36s)]
*  Dutreux affair became so frustrated with what he was facing that he eventually wrote a book to [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9502.6s)]
*  lay it all out. Quote, in further disclosures, which Belgium is doing its best to ignore, [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9507.16s)]
*  a book by the highly respected chairman of a parliamentary inquiry into the case claims [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9513.400000000001s)]
*  into the case claims that his commission's findings were muzzled by political and judicial [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9518.76s)]
*  leaders to prevent details emerging of complicity in the crimes. The families, who have faced a [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9523.72s)]
*  nightmarish four years since their children disappeared and will have to wait another two [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9530.76s)]
*  years before Mr. Dutreux has tried, have experienced scarcely credible official callousness during their [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9535.72s)]
*  ordeal. On top of police skepticism when they originally reported that their children had [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9542.039999999999s)]
*  vanished and an incompetent police inquiry to trace them, the parents were even confronted by [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9547.24s)]
*  the original post-mortem's gynecological revelations of assault during a live television appearance [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9553.24s)]
*  after the bodies were found. End quote. Like I said, the police investigators looking into the [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9558.76s)]
*  Dutreux case seemed to be doing everything in their power to throw the case. Witnesses would [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9565.64s)]
*  come forward who would never be interviewed. Crime scenes would be contaminated in the most [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9572.039999999999s)]
*  careless ways that implied it was done on purpose. Evidence was often lost or destroyed. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9576.84s)]
*  Several of the victims' families all complained that the police had been harassing and abusing them. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9584.28s)]
*  Police, when they did find evidence, would fail to report it to prosecutors. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9590.28s)]
*  The officers assigned to analyze the hundreds of hours of tapes found in Dutreux's home never did so. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9595.960000000001s)]
*  In 1995, Dutreux's own mother made a police report that her son, who was already a convicted [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9602.439999999999s)]
*  kidnapper and child rapist, his own mother made a police report that her son was holding two [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9608.759999999998s)]
*  young girls prisoner in his basement and the police ignored her. One time when the two girls [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9614.519999999999s)]
*  who ended up starving to death were still alive down in the dungeon, two police officers were [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9622.279999999999s)]
*  assigned to go search Dutreux's house, the one with the girls in the dungeon, after a neighbor [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9628.199999999999s)]
*  had made a call about hearing screaming children. When the police got there to search the place, [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9633.96s)]
*  they never found the girls despite the fact that they heard children screaming in the basement. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9640.439999999999s)]
*  The Belgian authorities had to admit that this error led directly to the death by starvation [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9648.279999999999s)]
*  of the two little girls. So what happened to that officer? Maybe he didn't commit a crime, but [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9654.2s)]
*  screw up like that on such a massive high profile case where public confidence is already [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9660.12s)]
*  non-existent and now they learned that the cop who searched the home ignored screaming children who [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9665.880000000001s)]
*  subsequently died of starvation. Surely his career is over, right? Surely he's lucky to be directing [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9671.720000000001s)]
*  traffic or writing parking tickets in a Brussels slum, right? Wrong. From Elizabeth Voss, quote, [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9679.32s)]
*  despite such extreme incompetence, if that's what it was, Marcheaux received a promotion to the [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9687.64s)]
*  position of police commissioner before his death in 2009. Marcheaux's promotion was viewed by many [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9693.8s)]
*  to have implied rewards for compliance in a deeply corrupt legal system that simultaneously [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9700.44s)]
*  punished those who acted on behalf of victims as had Judge Connerop. Corruption allegations were [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9707.08s)]
*  further fueled by the words of Anne Tilly, the prosecutor general of Liège, who claimed bodies [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9713.32s)]
*  recovered from Dutreau's property were too decomposed to perform DNA analysis. However, [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9719.8s)]
*  BBC reported that, autopsy states quite clearly that the bodies were not decomposed. Samples were [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9726.6s)]
*  taken. It is just that no one seems to know what has happened to the results. Why were the hairs [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9734.04s)]
*  which detectives gathered from the dungeon in Dutreau's cellar never sent for DNA analysis? [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9740.68s)]
*  This blatantly corrupt or incompetent process increased the gall of the Belgian public, end quote. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9746.68s)]
*  And finally, I'll just read the last section of this piece. Again, this is Elizabeth Voss. I know [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9753.640000000001s)]
*  I'm using a lot of her material here, but she wrote up a good summary, so I might as well use [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9759.0s)]
*  it and give her credit. There's a few bits in this section that I've already mentioned. Quote, [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9763.56s)]
*  numerous women, code named ex-witnesses, like X1, X2, X3, because they're anonymous, code named [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9768.439999999999s)]
*  ex-witnesses, spoke to investigators working on the Dutreau case, claiming to have suffered [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9776.199999999999s)]
*  horrific abuses at the hands of a criminal network linked to Dutreau and Nihon, which had abused [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9781.56s)]
*  children in order to blackmail members of the Belgian establishment. According to BBC, the [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9787.56s)]
*  ex-witnesses placed Nihon and Dutreau at the scene of torture, rape, and murder of multiple [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9793.0s)]
*  children along with other elite figures. Nihon was also accused of producing snuff films. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9799.56s)]
*  The number of witnesses eventually reached to X9. The New York Times also reported on the book [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9806.28s)]
*  The X-Files, What Belgium Was Not Supposed to Know About the Dutreau Affair, which extensively [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9813.24s)]
*  documented the ex-witnesses' testimony. The book draws copiously from police files, [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9818.52s)]
*  transcriptions of the ex-witnesses' evidence, the fines of a parliamentary commission, and other [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9823.880000000001s)]
*  sources. Even if the ex-witnesses' testimony occasionally seemed irrational, the authors say, [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9831.0s)]
*  the facts they described stand up to scrutiny. The first and most well-known victim to come [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9837.08s)]
*  forward was codenamed X1, her real identity later revealed in the press as Regina Loof. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9843.0s)]
*  The BBC described Loof's testimony. It was big business, blackmail, there was a lot of money [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9849.24s)]
*  involved. Sessions were secretly filmed without the client's knowledge. The Guardian described [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9855.0s)]
*  Loof's haunting allegations. This entertainment was not just sex, it involved sadism, torture, [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9861.16s)]
*  and even murder, and again she described the places, the victims, and the ways they were killed. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9866.6s)]
*  The New York Times also noted, Loof spoke of having been sold into prostitution by her [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9872.119999999999s)]
*  grandmother and later introduced into a circle of orgies at which she had seen young children [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9877.08s)]
*  tortured and murdered. The other ex-witnesses, one of whom worked for the police, told similar [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9883.08s)]
*  stories of childhood abuse and described hunts at which children were chased through the woods with [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9888.76s)]
*  dobermans. Mr. Debates had each of Loof's statements checked out and discovered that [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9894.44s)]
*  she had inexplicably detailed knowledge of the unsolved murders of two young women in the 1980s [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9902.04s)]
*  that supported the thesis of a conspiracy. As noted by the New York Times, Loof's testimony [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9907.880000000001s)]
*  was regarded as remarkably accurate to the point that she was able to correctly describe the scene [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9913.560000000001s)]
*  of an unsolved murder. The BBC reported Loof's detailed testimony had included details of names [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9918.44s)]
*  and locations where members of the establishment had engaged in violent orgies with children. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9924.92s)]
*  Loof alleged that Michel Nijol was a regular participant in events. Loof also claimed that [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9929.720000000001s)]
*  children had been raped, tortured, and murdered during these feted gatherings with the crimes [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9935.800000000001s)]
*  often filmed for blackmail purposes. The Guardian described Loof's accuracy. At least one of the [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9941.08s)]
*  murders she described matched an unsolved case. What Loof had described was a macabre torture [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9946.68s)]
*  which had eventually killed a 15-year-old she knew as Chrissy. It was a sort of bondage, she told me, [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9952.28s)]
*  so her legs and her hands and her throat were connected with the same rope and so when she [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9958.28s)]
*  moved she strangled herself. Further verifying the veracity of Loof's description, the Guardian [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9963.08s)]
*  wrote that the scene of the murder she claimed to have witnessed occurred in an underground [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9972.6s)]
*  mushroom form. The report states that the son of the former owner of the location had stated, [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9977.4s)]
*  Loof struggled to speak out on the horrific abuses she claimed to have experienced and [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9992.92s)]
*  witnessed ultimately failed. Investigators who believed her testimony to be credible [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=9997.16s)]
*  were removed from the investigation and her real identity was leaked to the press. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10002.2s)]
*  After Loof's identity was made public, her reputation was systematically destroyed. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10009.0s)]
*  The BBC wrote that after her identity became known, a government-owned TV station, RTBF, [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10013.640000000001s)]
*  began a campaign, quote, designed to prove that Dutreault was an isolated pervert kidnapping girls [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10019.960000000001s)]
*  for himself, that there was no network, that Jean-Michel Nihal was innocent and Regina Loof [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10025.4s)]
*  was a liar. At this point, the public effectively gave up struggling to find real justice for Dutreault's [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10032.84s)]
*  victims. To protest, systemic corruption was now to be associated with insanity and so [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10038.92s)]
*  outrage was morphed by shame into heavy silence. For years, the only answer to the known and unknown [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10046.279999999999s)]
*  victims of Dutreault was the same, a resounding silence, end quote. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10053.32s)]
*  So then I said in the previous episode and that I reinforced in this one, I'll reinforce again, [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10060.92s)]
*  is whenever you research stuff like this, you're going to encounter a lot of circumstantial evidence. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10066.6s)]
*  This guy's spending a lot of time with that guy, transferring large sums of money to him. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10073.08s)]
*  But of course, he had no idea that that guy was involved in anything illegal and the money was [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10078.84s)]
*  for totally legitimate purposes. And I can't recall what it was when, you know, I'm asked in court. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10083.16s)]
*  Government inquiry finds no evidence of a cover-up, but the chairman of that inquiry says that he's [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10089.32s)]
*  received death threats and warnings against pissing off prominent people. A bunch of girls say that [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10094.36s)]
*  this or that prominent person was present or participated in abuse, but those girls, they have [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10100.76s)]
*  all sorts of problems, as many victims of horrific childhood sexual abuse do, and so you can't believe [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10106.84s)]
*  them. This is how it goes. But we're not in court, you and me here talking and thinking about this. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10112.28s)]
*  We're not trying to put anyone in a cage so we don't have the burden of proof beyond a [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10120.76s)]
*  reasonable doubt. These are our governments. We have every right to look at all the facts, [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10124.44s)]
*  circumstantial or not, and decide that they require some answers. And if those answers are [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10130.44s)]
*  withheld or otherwise not forthcoming, I think it's reasonable to assume that there's a reason for that. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10136.52s)]
*  The Belgian people figured that out. I mean, let's just review what we know here on this case. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10143.800000000001s)]
*  The minister of justice overrules pretty much everyone in the chain of command to let a serial [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10151.48s)]
*  kidnapper and child rapist out of prison early. This guy has no discernible income, but he owns [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10155.720000000001s)]
*  10 homes, has millions of dollars in the bank, nobody knows how. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10163.08s)]
*  He and his accomplices and his lawyer and several victims all say that he was acting as part of a [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10168.039999999999s)]
*  group that included wealthy and prominent people in Belgium. The authorities keep losing key evidence. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10176.12s)]
*  The police show up to search the house of a guy who is a convicted kidnapper and child [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10183.32s)]
*  rapist so they know whose house they're checking on. They hear the sounds of screaming children [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10190.2s)]
*  downstairs, but they don't investigate, don't find the girls. The girls starve to death. The police [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10196.12s)]
*  admit that this killed the girls, and yet the policeman responsible is soon promoted to [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10201.640000000001s)]
*  commissioner of the entire police department. The judge is pulled from the case for attending a [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10207.400000000001s)]
*  benefit while another judge was kept on the case despite being so close to one of the accused [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10214.36s)]
*  that his sister was the godmother to the accused child. The judge, the prosecutor, and the chairman [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10220.6s)]
*  of the parliamentary inquiry are all on record saying that they were receiving threats and being [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10229.16s)]
*  told to stop looking into the case. All three of them complained that their attempt to get at the [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10234.6s)]
*  truth was being blocked from on high. The chief prosecutor dies under mysterious circumstances. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10239.56s)]
*  20 more witnesses and other people connected to the case die under mysterious circumstances [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10246.359999999999s)]
*  in a short period of time. The press has no interest in anything except making the implausible [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10251.32s)]
*  case that Dutreau worked alone and just for his own purposes. One of the victims, who named several [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10256.6s)]
*  prominent Belgians, had her identity leaked to the press which went through her history and [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10263.32s)]
*  smeared her until she went away. Well, how do you explain all of that? I know you can explain each [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10269.16s)]
*  one individually, you know, no problem. You know, you take one of those by themselves. Authorities [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10277.32s)]
*  lose key evidence. Well, I mean, it happens, right? It does happen, but you take them all together, [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10283.56s)]
*  and what do you make of that? How do you explain all of them? Because the thing is, if any one of [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10291.24s)]
*  them has a wrong answer, it becomes much more likely that they all have the wrong answers, [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10297.88s)]
*  right? The authorities lose key evidence. Maybe they did, but if they didn't, if they destroyed [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10304.6s)]
*  key evidence, then all of these other bullet points you have to start looking at with a more [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10309.72s)]
*  critical eye. If two of them turn out to be true, then the third one's got a lot better, and so on, [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10314.199999999999s)]
*  right? The biggest obstacle is that first one, just that inability to believe that something like [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10320.2s)]
*  this is possible. Like when Jeffrey Epstein supposedly killed himself in his jail cell in New [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10326.6s)]
*  York, in a jail where there hadn't been a suicide in over 20 years, we have been told that A, [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10333.16s)]
*  the two guards who were supposed to be checking on him every half hour fell asleep on watch, [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10340.36s)]
*  B, the two cameras on the tier containing Epstein's cell malfunctioned, and a third camera [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10345.32s)]
*  with a view of his cell from across the way had unusable footage, and C, we had very prominent [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10351.880000000001s)]
*  people, like Nancy Pelosi's daughter Christine Pelosi, saying openly that people were going down [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10357.08s)]
*  if Epstein talked. Nancy Pelosi's daughter tweeted, [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10364.52s)]
*  that some of our faves are implicated, but we must follow the facts and let the chips [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10375.16s)]
*  fall where they may, whether on Republicans or Democrats. Well, you can say that, yeah, look, [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10380.76s)]
*  cameras sometimes malfunction. It's weird that all three malfunction, but it's not impossible, [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10388.92s)]
*  and so it doesn't prove anything, and I agree, it doesn't prove anything. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10395.560000000001s)]
*  Or you can say that guards sometimes fall asleep on watch. It happens. It doesn't prove anything, [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10399.56s)]
*  and again, I agree, it doesn't prove anything, but you can't take those two things separately. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10406.92s)]
*  You can't say what are the chances that the guards would fall asleep on watch or that [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10411.88s)]
*  cameras would malfunction. You have to say what are the chances that all three cameras [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10416.199999999999s)]
*  would malfunction on the same night that Epstein's guards fell asleep, which happened to be the night [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10421.8s)]
*  that he killed himself. You have to say what are the chances that all three cameras malfunction on [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10427.56s)]
*  the same night as guards fell asleep and he killed himself, and that it's totally unrelated [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10432.279999999999s)]
*  that the attorney general overseeing the case, Trump's attorney general Bill Barr, [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10437.88s)]
*  just happens to be the son of the guy who gave Epstein his first job. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10443.48s)]
*  Again, it can happen. It could just totally be a coincidence. It doesn't prove anything. Small [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10449.32s)]
*  world, I guess, but it's a little weird. Isn't it a little weird that 50 years after Epstein gets [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10455.64s)]
*  his first job, his arrest and death just happened to be overseen by the son of the guy that gave him [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10461.16s)]
*  the job? Both Attorney General Bill Barr and his father, Donald Barr, were connected to the [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10468.92s)]
*  intelligence community. The father, Donald Barr, worked for the OSS during the war, the Office of [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10477.64s)]
*  Strategic Services, which was the organization set up during World War II and which turned into [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10483.64s)]
*  the CIA after the war. Bill Barr, the son, worked directly for the Central Intelligence Agency. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10488.76s)]
*  In 1974, when the son, Bill Barr, was working as a liaison to Congress in the lead up to the [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10496.439999999999s)]
*  Church and Pike Committee hearings, the father, Donald Barr, was the headmaster of prestigious [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10503.72s)]
*  private prep school in New York called the Dalton School. Again, this is 1974. Donald Barr [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10508.76s)]
*  hires Jeffrey Epstein to teach math. Well, I should say, so I don't know if Barr himself hired [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10516.28s)]
*  him, but he oversaw the hiring. He was in charge when Epstein was hired to teach at this school. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10523.16s)]
*  The thing is, Jeffrey Epstein didn't even have a college degree. He had no teaching experience [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10529.56s)]
*  whatsoever. This is a very prestigious school. You've got the sons and daughters of Wall Street [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10534.36s)]
*  CEOs going to school here and their parents paid a lot of money for it. You would think that they [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10540.28s)]
*  could have just about any high school teacher in the country teach math for them, but for some [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10544.2s)]
*  reason, the administration under Donald Barr decided to hire a college dropout with no teaching [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10549.32s)]
*  experiences, which is weird. Not so weird that we should run around with our hair on fire over it, [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10554.76s)]
*  maybe, but weird. It's another thing to put in the bag. Just like it's weird that almost 50 years [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10560.84s)]
*  later, 45 years later, the attorney general who arrests Epstein just happens to be the son of the [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10567.56s)]
*  guy who gave him that first job. It's just weird. It gets weirder because Donald Barr, the father who [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10573.08s)]
*  hired him, very strange guy. In addition to being a prep school headmaster and intelligence agent, [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10579.24s)]
*  Donald Barr also dabbled in writing science fiction. Some of you may have heard about this. [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10587.24s)]
*  The year before Epstein was hired at Dalton School, he, Donald Barr, the guy who gave Epstein that [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10592.52s)]
*  job, father of Attorney General Bill Barr, wrote a book called Space Relations, a slightly gothic [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10599.640000000001s)]
*  interplanetary tale. What is this book about? Glad you asked. To keep it short, I'll just read from [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10605.880000000001s)]
*  Wikipedia. I have read the book and this summary is close enough. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10613.48s)]
*  In the future, humans have formed an intergalactic empire ruled by aristocrats. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10617.96s)]

*  things of the galaxy's super rich. Craig, who is now campaigning to bring Kosar into the empire, [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10670.76s)]
*  had previously been to the planet when the passenger ship on which he was traveling on [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10679.960000000001s)]

*  one of the pirates awakened Craig and the other prisoners to rape a 15-year-old [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10690.76s)]

*  the beautiful, sensual, and sadistic Lady Morgan Sidney, the only female member of the oligarchy, [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10708.359999999999s)]

*  When he is ordered to sexually assault the enslaved teenager, he enjoys his participation [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10735.0s)]
*  in the act. End quote. Okay, you just add that to the pile of things that would have to be [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10740.44s)]
*  coincidental or irrelevant. Jeffrey Epstein, a human trafficker and predator who picked up [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10748.04s)]

*  doing writing novels about kidnapping and raping teenagers in the first place? I don't know. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10795.48s)]
*  I want to tell you about one more incident. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10800.519999999999s)]
*  We've talked about the Kinkora Boys Home scandal in Northern Ireland, [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10804.92s)]
*  and I told you there's a great book on it called Who Framed Colin Wallace by the journalist and [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10808.359999999999s)]
*  author Paul Foot. We also talked about Belgium's Dutreau affair, and well, further reading on that [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10813.08s)]
*  one is the stuff of nightmares. I spared you the worst of it, and I got to the bottom of it. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10822.84s)]
*  Specifically, I should say, just to clarify, that book that I mentioned earlier, the one that digs [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10826.84s)]
*  into the testimony of the ex-witnesses, don't read that book. It's a nightmare. It's just an absolute [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10830.2s)]
*  nightmare. One of those things that doesn't leave you. This final incident that I'm going to tell [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10835.24s)]
*  you about started in Tallahassee, Florida in 1988. It was a very, very, very, very, very, [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10841.880000000001s)]
*  this final incident that I'm going to tell you about started in Tallahassee, Florida in 1987 [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10850.199999999999s)]
*  when police responded to a call about two well-dressed men and some children that were [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10858.6s)]
*  with them. It was nighttime, and the two men were outside in a park apparently supervising [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10864.68s)]
*  these six children who it turned out were aged two to 11. When the police arrived, [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10872.199999999999s)]
*  they found the children filthy and hungry, covered in bruises, covered in bites and sores, [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10879.0s)]
*  and they were described as behaving like animals, like unsocialized, not understanding simple words [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10887.480000000001s)]
*  or knowing what very basic things were, their eyes kind of darting around. None of the children [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10893.720000000001s)]
*  belonged to either of the two men who were evasive and told different stories when police questioned [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10899.800000000001s)]
*  them. The whole group had been traveling in a van, and the men said that they had been taking [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10906.76s)]
*  the kids to a special school for gifted children in Mexico. According to unredacted documents [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10912.44s)]
*  generated by the Tallahassee Police Department at the time, pictures of naked children were found [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10918.36s)]
*  in the van. Local officials in Florida said that at least two of the children showed signs of sexual [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10923.960000000001s)]
*  abuse. So the two men are arrested, the kids are placed in protection. The van was registered out [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10931.4s)]
*  of state, and the children had spoken about living in Washington, D.C., and so the Tallahassee cops [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10938.199999999999s)]
*  reach out to U.S. Customs, which has a dedicated child trafficking and pornography task force [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10942.92s)]
*  to see if they might be able to provide some insight and help connect them with the right [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10949.24s)]
*  people in D.C. And so a customs agent named Ramon Martinez gets the case, and his first report [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10952.76s)]
*  begins like this, quote, On Thursday, February 5th, 1987, this office was contacted via telephone [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10960.2s)]
*  by Sergeant Joanne Van Meter of the Tallahassee Police Department Juvenile Division. Sergeant Van [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10967.560000000001s)]
*  Meter requested assistance in identifying two adult males and six minor children. The adult males [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10973.640000000001s)]
*  were tentatively identified by TPD, Tallahassee Police Department, as Michael Houlihan and Douglas [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10979.960000000001s)]
*  Ammerman, both of Washington, D.C., who were arrested the previous day on charges of child [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10985.96s)]
*  abuse. The police had received an anonymous telephone call relative to two well-dressed [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10992.359999999999s)]
*  white men wearing suits and ties in Myers Park, Tallahassee, apparently watching six dirty and [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=10998.359999999999s)]
*  unkempt children in the playground area. Houlihan and Ammerman were near a 1980 blue Dodge van bearing [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11004.679999999998s)]
*  a Virginia license plate number, the inside of which was later described as foul-smelling, [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11011.56s)]
*  filled with maps, books, letters, with a mattress situated to the rear of the van, which appeared as [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11016.76s)]
*  if it was used as a bed, and the overall appearance of the van gave the impression that all eight [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11022.68s)]
*  persons were living in it. The children were covered with insect bites, were very dirty, [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11027.4s)]
*  most of the children were not wearing underwear, and all the children had not been bathed in many [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11033.48s)]
*  days. And so in a follow-up report, second report he files, he says, quote, upon being taken into [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11037.88s)]
*  custody, the adult white males refused to cooperate, one of whom produced a business card with a name [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11046.759999999998s)]
*  on one side and a statement on the other. The statement indicated that the bearer knew his [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11053.08s)]
*  constitutional rights to remain silent and that he intended to do so. Upon interviewing the children, [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11057.88s)]
*  the police officers found that they could not adequately identify themselves or their custodians. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11063.48s)]
*  Further, they stated they were en route to Mexico to attend a school for smart kids. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11069.48s)]
*  We were further advised the children were unaware of the function and purpose of telephones, [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11074.84s)]
*  televisions, and toilets, and that the children had stated that they were not allowed to live [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11079.8s)]
*  indoors and were only given food as a reward, end quote. And so this van, it turns out, [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11084.6s)]
*  is connected to two addresses in the Washington, D.C. area. So Customs starts contacting [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11092.92s)]
*  other agencies and the D.C. Metro Police to see if anybody knows anything. [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11099.24s)]
*  Turns out that someone did know something. A D.C. Metro Police detective had had an open [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11103.960000000001s)]
*  investigation into those two addresses since the previous year when an informant had told him that [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11111.4s)]
*  the people who lived there were a cult engaged in bloody rituals and sexual abuse of children and [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11117.24s)]
*  that they were connected to an unsolved murder. The addresses were a duplex and then a warehouse. [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11124.44s)]
*  They were owned and lived in by this communal living group calling itself the Finders. [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11134.68s)]
*  The police informant had also provided the names of the people living there and they matched up [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11141.48s)]
*  with the names of the men and the kids found in Tallahassee. So they found him pretty credible. [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11147.08s)]
*  It was soon determined that the two men picked up in Tallahassee were members of this group. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11152.359999999999s)]
*  The D.C. detective who had been investigating the Finders told Customs that he'd been trying to get [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11157.72s)]
*  probable cause to search these properties for quite a while and that this Tallahassee incident [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11163.72s)]
*  gave him the probable cause he needed. So Customs sent Agent Ramon Martinez to go participate in the [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11169.56s)]
*  raid with the D.C. police on these properties. And this is from his report on that raid. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11175.960000000001s)]
*  During the execution of the warrant, I was able to observe and access the entire building. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11182.04s)]
*  I saw large quantities of children's clothing and toys, the clothing consisting of diapers and clothes [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11187.64s)]
*  in the toddler to preschool range. No children were found on the premises. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11194.04s)]
*  There were several subjects on the premises. Only one was deemed to be connected with the Finders. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11199.800000000001s)]
*  The rest were renting living space from this individual. He was identified as Stuart Miles [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11204.68s)]
*  Silverstone, DOB 061941, U.S. Passport Number 0109-58991. Silverstone was located in a room [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11212.52s)]
*  equipped with several computers, printers, and numerous documents. Cursory examination of the [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11223.0s)]
*  documents revealed detailed instructions for obtaining children for unspecified purposes. [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11229.16s)]
*  The instructions included the impregnation of female members of the community known as Finders, [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11235.16s)]
*  purchasing children, trading, and kidnapping. There were telex messages. For you youngsters, [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11241.16s)]
*  a telex machine is like a typewriter that was able to send secure peer-to-peer messages through [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11248.68s)]
*  the phone line to other telex machines on the same network. Kind of similar in function to a [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11254.52s)]
*  fax machine, except it was like a typewriter that you would type your message over and it would come [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11259.56s)]
*  out on a piece of paper on the other side. There were telex messages using MCI account numbers [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11264.04s)]
*  between a computer terminal believed to be located in the same room and others located across the [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11270.12s)]
*  country and in foreign locations. One such telex specifically ordered the purchase of two children [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11275.72s)]
*  in Hong Kong to be arranged through a contact in the Chinese embassy there. Another telex [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11282.359999999999s)]
*  expressed interest in bank secrecy situations. Other documents identified interest in high-tech [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11288.119999999999s)]
*  transfers to the United Kingdom, numerous properties under the control of the Finders, [[03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11294.76s)]
*  a keen interest in terrorism, explosives, and the evasion of law enforcement. Also found in the [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11300.12s)]
*  computer room was a detailed summary of the events surrounding the arrest and taking into custody [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11306.76s)]
*  of the two adults and six children in Tallahassee, Florida on the previous night. There was also a [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11313.640000000001s)]
*  set of instructions which appeared to be broadcast via a computer network which advised participants [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11319.160000000002s)]
*  to move the children and keep them moving through different jurisdictions and instructions on how [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11325.08s)]
*  to avoid police attention. One of the residents was identified as a Chinese national. Due to the [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11331.0s)]
*  telex discovered referencing the Chinese embassy in Hong Kong, he was fully identified for future [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11337.88s)]
*  reference. Wang Gengxin, DOB 092747, place of birth Tianjin, People's Republic of China, passport [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11343.16s)]

*  as a graduate student in the anatomy department of Georgetown University. His visa was issued on [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11362.279999999999s)]
*  November 10, 1986 in London, England, number 00143." Pretty strange. Gets stranger. The report continues [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11367.88s)]
*  a little bit further down. Quote, special agent Harold, this was the other customs agent that was [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11378.36s)]
*  sent on this raid with Martinez, special agent Harold advised me that there were extremely large [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11384.2s)]
*  quantities of documents and computer equipment at the warehouse and that MPD, Metro Police Department, [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11389.960000000001s)]
*  was posting officers inside the building there and sealing the building until morning in which a [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11396.12s)]
*  second warrant for the premises would be obtained and executed. On Friday, February 6, 1987, I met [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11401.16s)]
*  Detective Bradley, who is the MPD detective who was on this case for a while, at the warehouse on [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11409.0s)]
*  4th Street, Northeast. I duly advised my acting group supervisor, Special Agent Don Bloodworth. [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11415.64s)]
*  I was again granted unlimited access to the premises. I was able to observe numerous documents [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11422.119999999999s)]
*  which described explicit sexual conduct between members of the community known as finders. [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11428.12s)]
*  I also saw a large collection of photographs of unidentified persons. Some of the photographs were [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11433.400000000001s)]
*  nudes believed to be members of the finders. There were also numerous photos of children, [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11439.560000000001s)]
*  some nude, at least one of which was a child on display and appearing to accent the child's [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11445.0s)]
*  genitals. I was only able to examine a very small amount of the photos at this time. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11451.480000000001s)]
*  However, one of the officers presented me with a photo album for my review. The album contained [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11457.72s)]
*  a series of photos of adults and children dressed in white sheets participating in a blood ritual. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11463.72s)]
*  The ritual centered around the execution of at least two goats. The photos portrayed the execution, [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11471.08s)]
*  disembowelment, skinning, and dismemberment of the goats at the hands of the children. [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11478.28s)]
*  This included the removal of the testes of the male goat, the discovery of a female goat's womb [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11483.88s)]
*  and the baby goats inside the womb, and the presentation of a goat's head to one of the [[03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11490.28s)]
*  children. End quote. So who are these people? This is not just some crazy family or cult [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11496.039999999999s)]
*  living on a commune in the jungles of Guyana. The cops discovered a pretty serious operation here. [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11505.56s)]
*  One with a lot of interest and apparently global reach. Quote, further inspection of the premises. [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11512.839999999998s)]
*  Again, this is from these customs agent reports. Further inspection of the premises [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11519.48s)]
*  disclosed numerous files relating to activities of the organization in different parts of the world. [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11524.439999999999s)]
*  Locations I observed are as follows. London, Germany, the Bahamas, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11529.64s)]
*  Africa, Costa Rica, and Europe. There was also a file identified as Palestinian. Other files were [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11538.2s)]
*  identified by member name or project name. The projects appearing appeared to be operated for [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11547.640000000001s)]
*  commercial purposes under front names for the finders. There was one file entitled Pentagon [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11555.08s)]
*  break-in and others which referred to members operating in foreign countries. Not observed by [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11560.76s)]
*  me but related by an MPD officer were intelligence files on private families not related to the [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11566.68s)]
*  finders. The process undertaken appears to have been a systematic response to local newspaper [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11572.84s)]
*  advertisements for babysitters, tutors, etc. A member of the finders would respond and gather [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11579.24s)]
*  as much information as possible about the habits, identity, occupation, etc. of the family. The use [[03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11585.32s)]
*  to which this information was to be put is still unknown. There was also a large amount of data [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11592.52s)]
*  collected on various child care organizations. The warehouse contained a large library, two kitchens, [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11598.04s)]
*  and a sauna, hot tub, and video room. The video room seemed to be set up as an indoctrination center. [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11605.16s)]
*  It also appeared that the organization had the capability to produce its own videos. [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11612.12s)]
*  There were what appeared to be training areas for children and what appeared to be an altar [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11617.16s)]
*  set up in a residential area of the warehouse. Many jars of urine and feces were located in this area. [[03:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11622.68s)]
*  I should also mention that both premises were equipped with satellite dish antennas." [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11629.880000000001s)]
*  While Agent Martinez tries to stay engaged with this case, but pretty soon the D.C. Metro police [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11636.44s)]
*  seem to start stonewalling him. His final report, which was filed just a couple months after that [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11642.359999999999s)]
*  last one, said, quote, on March 31st, 1987, I contacted Detective James Bradley of the [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11648.039999999999s)]
*  Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, MPD. I went to meet with Detective Bradley to [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11654.92s)]
*  review the documents seized pursuant to two search warrants executed in February 1987. [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11660.439999999999s)]
*  The meeting was to take place on April 2nd or 3rd, 1987. [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11666.679999999998s)]
*  On April 2nd, 1987, I arrived at MPD at approximately 9 a.m. Detective Bradley was [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11671.72s)]
*  not available. I spoke to a third party who was willing to discuss the case with me. [[03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11678.199999999999s)]
*  I was advised that all the passport data had been turned over to the State Department for [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11683.64s)]
*  their investigation. The State Department, in turn, advised MPD that all travel and use of the [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11688.039999999999s)]
*  passports by the holders of the passports was within the law and no action would be taken. [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11694.12s)]
*  This included travel to Moscow, North Korea, and North Vietnam from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s. [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11700.04s)]
*  Let's just pause there for a second. The founder and leader of the Finders group was a retired [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11710.6s)]
*  Air Force Master Sergeant named Marion Petty. The passport with visa stamps for Moscow, [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11718.36s)]
*  North Korea, and Vietnam belonged to his wife, Isabel Petty. Isabel Petty, according to her [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11728.84s)]
*  husband's own public statements as well as declassified FBI documents, worked for many [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11735.24s)]
*  years at the CIA. According to the FBI documents, she worked for the CIA from 1951 to 1971. [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11740.52s)]
*  CIA says she worked there from 52 to 61. She worked for the CIA for at least one, maybe two decades. [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11749.640000000001s)]
*  The CIA says she was a secretary, but it's not a simple thing for anybody to travel from the US to [[03:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11757.48s)]
*  Moscow, North Korea, and North Vietnam at the height of the Cold War. The chances that an employee [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11767.4s)]
*  of the CIA would be traveling to those places on anything other than official business does not [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11774.039999999999s)]
*  seem plausible. Agent Martinez's report continues, quote, The individual, he's talking about the DC [[03:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11779.32s)]
*  cop who agreed to fill him in since Detective Bradley wasn't available, the individual further [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11787.96s)]
*  advised me of circumstances which indicated that the investigation into the activity of the [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11793.16s)]
*  Finders had become a CIA internal matter. The MPD report has been classified secret and was not [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11797.8s)]
*  available for review. I was advised that the FBI had withdrawn from the investigation several weeks [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11805.48s)]
*  prior and that the FBI foreign counterintelligence division had directed MPD not to advise the FBI [[03:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11811.08s)]
*  Washington field office of anything that had transpired. No further information will be [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11818.2s)]
*  available. No further action will be taken, end quote. Well, a few years later, when the Finders [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11823.960000000001s)]
*  incident was raised in a congressional investigation, US News and World Report put out a story on it, [[03:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11832.84s)]
*  quote, One of the unresolved questions involves allegations that the Finders are somehow linked [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11839.240000000002s)]
*  to the Central Intelligence Agency. Customs service documents reveal that in 1987, when customs agents [[03:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11845.56s)]
*  sought to examine the evidence gathered by Washington DC police, they were told that the [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11852.279999999999s)]
*  Finders investigation had become a CIA internal matter. The police report on the case had been [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11857.16s)]
*  classified secret. Even now, Tallahassee police complain about the handling of the Finders [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11863.96s)]
*  investigation by DC police. They dropped this case, one Tallahassee investigator says, like a hot [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11869.16s)]
*  rock. DC police will not comment on the matter. As for the CIA, high ranking officials describe [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11875.48s)]
*  allegations about links between the intelligence agency and the Finders as hogwash, perhaps the [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11882.279999999999s)]
*  result of a simple mix up with DC police. The only connection, according to the CIA, a firm that [[03:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11887.96s)]
*  provided computer training to CIA officers also employed several members of the Finders. And [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11894.6s)]
*  that's not exactly true. This was actually a company owned by the Finders that was providing [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11902.039999999999s)]
*  computer training to CIA officers. The many unanswered questions about the Finders case [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11906.119999999999s)]
*  now have Democratic Representative Charlie Rose of North Carolina, Chairman of the House [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11912.199999999999s)]
*  Administration Committee, and Florida's Representative Tom Lewis, a Republican, [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11916.679999999998s)]
*  more than a little exercised. Could our own government have something to do with the [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11921.24s)]
*  Finders organization and turn their backs on these children? That's what all the evidence points to, [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11925.4s)]
*  says Lewis. And there's a lot of evidence. I can tell you this, we've got a lot of people [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11930.84s)]
*  scrambling and that wouldn't be happening if there was nothing here. Perhaps, but the Finders say [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11935.4s)]
*  there is nothing there, at least nothing illegal. The Finders have never been involved in child [[03:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11942.6s)]
*  abuse, pornography, Satanism, animal slaughter, or anything of the kind, says the group's leader, [[03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11948.04s)]
*  Marion David Petty. Petty too says the group has never been connected to the CIA. [[03:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11954.52s)]
*  In an interview with US News, Petty described the Finders as a communal, holistic living and [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11960.679999999998s)]
*  learning arrangement. The group numbers some 20 members, Petty says. They do freelance journalism, [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11966.519999999999s)]
*  research, and competitor intelligence for a variety of mostly foreign clients. [[03:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11972.839999999998s)]
*  The Finders work for no foreign governments, Petty says. Their duplex in a residential [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11979.16s)]
*  Northwest Washington neighborhood is decorated with global maps and bulletin boards. Residents [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11984.28s)]
*  of Culpepper, Virginia, 90 minutes from Washington, say that the Finders have operated an office [[03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11989.960000000001s)]
*  there too from time to time. That office contained computer terminals and clocks referencing different [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=11995.400000000001s)]
*  time zones around the world. CIA officials say they referred all matters concerning the Finders [[03:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12001.400000000001s)]
*  in the police investigation to the FBI's Foreign Counterintelligence Division. FBI officials will [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12008.44s)]
*  not comment. Law enforcement sources say some of the Finders are listed in the FBI's classified [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12013.96s)]
*  counterintelligence files. None of this fazes Petty. He says the CIA's interest in the Finders may [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12019.8s)]
*  stem from the fact that his late wife once worked for the agency and that his son worked for a CIA [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12027.0s)]
*  proprietary firm, Air America. Air America, you remember them from last episode, right? [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12032.759999999998s)]
*  Air America was the CIA front company airline that was shuttling weapons and supplies and money [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12040.359999999999s)]
*  and people and possibly, according to several witnesses who were involved, drugs in support of [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12046.76s)]
*  the paramilitaries that we were supporting in Laos during Vietnam. They changed the name eventually [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12053.16s)]
*  by having Air America absorbed by another company called Southern Air Transport, which was also a [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12059.16s)]
*  CIA front and which was central to the Iran-Contra scandal, running money and weapons to the Middle [[03:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12064.44s)]
*  East and Central America and at least, according to several people who were involved, bringing [[03:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12070.36s)]
*  cocaine to the United States. So the son of the founder of this Finders group, who is himself, [[03:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12074.76s)]
*  the founder is a retired Air Force Master Sergeant. I don't know which field. I'd be interested to know [[03:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12082.44s)]
*  if he was involved in intelligence. The son of that guy used to work for that company, Air America, [[03:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12087.720000000001s)]
*  and the wife of this guy used to work for the CIA and had a passport stamped from that period of time [[03:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12093.88s)]
*  with Moscow, North Vietnam, and North Korea and their properties are strewn with global maps and [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12101.16s)]
*  telex machines connected to overseas locations and mentions of members operating in other countries [[03:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12107.48s)]
*  and the group owned a company that provided computer training to CIA officers, but it's all [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12113.88s)]
*  just a coincidence. Only a crazy person would believe that it wasn't all just a coincidence. [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12120.52s)]
*  I'll tell you what, this has taken longer than expected. I think we're up to about two hours [[03:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12128.36s)]
*  right now, so we are going to have to do one more Epstein episode to drive things home and then I'll [[03:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12132.04s)]
*  stop, I promise. I'm really tired of it, to be honest. I appreciate you guys sticking with me [[03:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12138.76s)]
*  through this Sorted series. I am looking forward to being done with it and moving on. [[03:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12144.92s)]
*  Part Three. While we're denouncing, let me ask you about QAnon. It is this theory that [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12156.52s)]
*  Democrats are a satanic pedophile ring and that you are the savior of that. Now, can you just [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12164.52s)]
*  once and for all state that that is completely not true and disavow QAnon in its entirety? [[03:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12172.12s)]
*  I know nothing about QAnon. I just told you. I know very little. You told me, but what you tell [[03:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12180.12s)]
*  me doesn't necessarily make it fact. I hate to say that. I know nothing about it. I do know they [[03:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12185.240000000002s)]
*  are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard, but I know nothing about it. They believe [[03:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12190.92s)]
*  it is a satanic call run by the D. States. There has been an awakening. Have you felt it? [[03:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12197.64s)]
*  In the last few months, a bizarre conspiracy theory has taken root firmly on the fringes. [[03:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12207.64s)]
*  They call it red pill. Imagine enjoying your time at a pizza parlor when a man walks in with an [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12213.88s)]
*  assault rifle. Customers at Comet Ping Pong in D.C. were terrified, as you can imagine. [[03:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12218.92s)]
*  We were in the middle section where the ping pong tables are. I was playing ping pong. We [[03:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12224.44s)]
*  finished our meal. I was playing ping pong with my wife and my kids were playing at the table next [[03:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12230.12s)]
*  to us. Basically, a person walked in, kind of tall, slender white guy who walked straight into the [[03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12234.12s)]
*  back room. Followers believe that a cabal of pedophiles runs the United States. NewsNite has [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12243.560000000001s)]
*  seen data that shows a huge spike in interest in this conspiracy theory during the pandemic. [[03:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12252.28s)]
*  But what is QAnon? Well, the man said he was there to investigate PizzaGate, a hashtag referring to [[03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12258.52s)]
*  a fake news article claiming that Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief were in a child trafficking [[03:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12266.04s)]
*  ring in the restaurant's back rooms. They call it red pill. They call it red pill. [[03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12271.400000000001s)]
*  Anyone who likes a good story as much as I do is going to be in danger of becoming a sucker for [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12277.48s)]
*  conspiracy theories. After all, that's what a conspiracy theory is. It's just a story, right? [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12284.68s)]
*  Conspiracy theories come in all shapes and sizes from a group of people working together to embezzle [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12290.84s)]
*  funds from their company to a group working to overthrow a government. Many of the best conspiracy [[03:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12296.84s)]
*  theories involve governments themselves for obvious reasons, right? And for one thing, [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12303.32s)]
*  especially since the end of the Second World War, government operations have taken on a level of [[03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12310.84s)]
*  official secrecy that previously probably wouldn't have been tolerated or else simply wouldn't have [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12317.64s)]
*  been relevant to the state's needs. Another reason is that in the age of nuclear weapons, which [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12324.039999999999s)]
*  made kinetic warfare between powerful states very difficult or almost impossible, information [[03:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12332.92s)]
*  operations became a much more important part of statecraft. NATO and the Warsaw Pact only engaged [[03:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12340.12s)]
*  directly in serious military conflict over client states a few times in places like Korea, Vietnam, [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12348.28s)]
*  Afghanistan, but their operations to subvert and incite and confuse and to direct local proxies [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12353.88s)]
*  using information warfare were constant and global. When governments are engaged in large-scale [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12362.92s)]
*  systematic deception as a means of statecraft, it means that attentive people are going to notice [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12372.839999999998s)]
*  over time that there are a lot of holes in the official narrative. Recently declassified documents, [[03:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12379.64s)]
*  for example, have shown that a unit run out of London by the British Foreign Office during the [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12388.68s)]
*  Cold War was running black propaganda campaigns designed to, quote, encourage racial tension, [[03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12393.72s)]
*  sow chaos, and incite violence in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia, [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12400.199999999999s)]
*  parts of the world that probably have enough of those things, and I don't think they needed more. [[03:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12406.359999999999s)]
*  Operations in the Muslim world had the explicit goal, this was the explicit policy goal, [[03:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12412.279999999999s)]
*  of encouraging Islamic extremism and discrediting moderate Muslim leaders. There are several reasons [[03:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12420.119999999999s)]
*  for doing that. One of them was to encourage terrorism and revolution among Muslims in the [[03:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12426.76s)]
*  Soviet Union. The propaganda, which again was created out of an office of the UK government, [[03:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12431.4s)]
*  actually incited hatred against Israel in order to appear authentic to the people reading it. [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12439.64s)]
*  We know that British intelligence services were engaged in similar operations in Northern Ireland [[03:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12448.36s)]
*  in the 1970s. I spoke a bit about that in episode two. It's extremely strong evidence that MI5 even [[03:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12453.4s)]
*  targeted British politicians that it feared would moderate the government's policy toward Northern [[03:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12461.32s)]
*  Ireland. Of course, in the United States, we all know about Co-Intel Pro, the FBI's secret [[03:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12466.119999999999s)]
*  operation to destabilize and discredit left-wing activists in groups like the Black Panthers. [[03:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12474.84s)]
*  Co-Intel Pro operators did things like manufacture fake evidence that the Black Panther leaders were [[03:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12481.56s)]
*  sleeping with each other's wives for the explicit purpose of getting them to kill each other. [[03:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12487.4s)]
*  In 1970, the FBI planted stories in the press accusing an actress and left-wing activist named [[03:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12493.64s)]
*  Jeanne Seberg, who was married to a French diplomat, of being pregnant from an affair with [[03:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12501.56s)]
*  a Black Panther leader. She and her husband knew that it wasn't true, but the public humiliation [[03:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12507.8s)]
*  turned Seberg into basically a recluse, and the stress of the whole thing caused her to lose the [[03:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12514.76s)]
*  baby, and the trauma of the miscarriage ground her down even further, and a few years later, [[03:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12519.880000000001s)]
*  she committed suicide. Most of us are familiar with how the Gulf of Tonkin resolution allowing [[03:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12525.16s)]
*  Lyndon Johnson to go to war in Vietnam was based on an incident that turns out never happened. [[03:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12533.56s)]
*  People still argue over whether the Bush administration was lying or simply wrong [[03:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12539.16s)]
*  about Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction, but what we do know is that the [[03:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12545.4s)]
*  decision to go to war in Iraq was made in the days immediately after 9-11, and that there was a [[03:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12549.48s)]
*  conscious effort within the administration to play up shaky intelligence that supported the WMD [[03:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12555.720000000001s)]
*  thesis, and to downplay stronger evidence to the contrary, to include pre-Soviet [[03:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12560.76s)]
*  include personal and career attacks against officials and the few journalists who actually [[03:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12567.24s)]
*  question the story. I was just a kid at the time of the first Gulf War in 1991, but even still, [[03:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12572.12s)]
*  I remember feeling shocked and horrified when a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl was brought before the [[03:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12580.2s)]
*  U.S. Congress for a televised, nationally televised, very well publicized congressional hearing, [[03:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12588.04s)]
*  and she claimed to have seen Iraqi soldiers going into hospitals to throw babies out of their [[03:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12594.92s)]
*  incubators. They didn't tell us at the time that that little girl that they brought in for that [[03:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12599.8s)]
*  testimony was the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador who lived in Washington, D.C. with him, [[03:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12606.92s)]
*  and that the entire testimony was scripted and coached. We learned that later, and the news [[03:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12613.960000000001s)]
*  didn't get nearly as much coverage as the girl's original testimony. [[03:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12618.92s)]
*  This is how our governments operate now, as a matter of course. This is normal. [[03:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12622.76s)]
*  They feel no obligation to disclose even basic information that would be crucial [[03:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12629.320000000002s)]
*  to our ability to make decisions on critical questions like whether or not we should go to [[03:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12639.08s)]
*  war. They consider, many of them in good faith, I think, that it's actually a national security [[03:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12645.32s)]
*  imperative that the people know as little as possible about what they're doing, because [[03:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12654.76s)]
*  why, if the people knew the truth, they might decide to take a course other than what the [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12660.199999999999s)]
*  people on the inside, the people who think about these things, who see the big picture, [[03:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12664.199999999999s)]
*  believe is in the best interest of the country. [[03:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12669.72s)]
*  And so as a result, our understanding of history since the end of the Cold War [[03:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12671.56s)]
*  is, and unfortunately probably always will be, an extremely distorted picture, [[03:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12678.119999999999s)]
*  mixing fact with lies purposely planted in order to hide and confuse the truth. [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12685.08s)]
*  This is an environment in which conspiracy theories are going to grow like weeds. [[03:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12693.0s)]
*  If the reasons given for every war since Korea have turned out to be false, [[03:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12698.76s)]
*  and who knows, maybe I'm just not red-pilled on the Korean War yet, [[03:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12705.08s)]
*  and intelligence and law enforcement agencies have driven people to murder and suicide by [[03:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12709.32s)]
*  spreading false rumors in the press, it's safe to say that nothing is beyond the pale for these [[03:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12714.76s)]
*  people. Institutions and media organizations that are not aware of these things are not [[03:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12719.72s)]
*  institutions and media organizations that might have previously been able to speak [[03:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12726.519999999999s)]
*  with some credibility, some authority to the general public have publicly [[03:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12732.119999999999s)]
*  beshitted themselves so thoroughly that there's no one anymore around with the credibility to [[03:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12739.32s)]
*  put the kibosh on a buddy conspiracy theory because they say so, or as Walter Cronkite used [[03:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12745.48s)]
*  to say, because that's the way it is. There's nobody like that. And so when we're fed a story [[03:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12751.0s)]
*  which powerful people have motive, capability, and opportunity to lie about, and when the story [[03:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12757.8s)]
*  itself doesn't pass basic logical smell tests, no one cares anymore that the New York Times [[03:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12764.6s)]
*  doesn't find it worth reporting on, or that the FBI doesn't think it's worth investigating. [[03:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12771.64s)]
*  If anything, that just adds to the suspicion these days. Now, of course, this doesn't mean that all [[03:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12776.04s)]
*  conspiracy theories are true, and that's the problem. In fact, pushing implausible maximalist [[03:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12780.76s)]
*  versions of a conspiracy theory that's edging up against a guarded truth is one way that intelligence [[03:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12787.640000000001s)]
*  agencies have thrown people off their scent over the years. The very term conspiracy theory [[03:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12794.84s)]
*  seems to have actually been created by the CIA to put a negative spin on attempts to uncover things [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12802.359999999999s)]
*  that it would rather keep hidden. Now, remember back when the Pizzagate stuff came out [[03:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12808.44s)]
*  after the release of the Podesta emails by WikiLeaks in 2016? You remember that? [[03:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12817.32s)]
*  And for those of you who don't remember the story or who've put it out of your mind, [[03:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12823.24s)]
*  it went like this. John Podesta had been a fixture in Washington, DC for some 50 years. [[03:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12827.56s)]
*  He worked for several Democratic politicians and committees through the 70s and 80s, [[03:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12835.4s)]
*  and in 1988, he and his brother Tony Podesta started up the Podesta Group. It was called the [[03:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12840.44s)]
*  Podesta Associates at the time. It was a lobbying company that became what many people considered [[03:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12845.72s)]
*  the most powerful Democrat lobbying firm in Washington, DC. Well, John Podesta had met Bill [[03:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12852.44s)]
*  Clinton in 1970 when they both worked for the same senator, and when Clinton became president [[03:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12857.960000000001s)]
*  in the 1990s, Podesta came in and served in high positions in the administration throughout his [[03:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12863.560000000001s)]
*  entire tenure, eventually becoming Clinton's chief of staff. In 2003, he started the Center for [[03:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12868.44s)]
*  American Progress, which is one of the Democratic Party's main political parties. He was a [[03:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12875.720000000001s)]
*  Democratic Party's main private propaganda outfits, and I don't say that to cast dispersions. Both [[03:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12880.68s)]
*  sides have them. In 2016, when Hillary Clinton needed a campaign manager, she called John Podesta. [[03:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12887.08s)]
*  And so all this is simply to say Podesta is one of those people, and there's a whole class of them [[03:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12894.92s)]
*  in both parties, who never runs for office, never heads up a government agency, but just always [[03:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12900.2s)]
*  seems to be around and in the mix in Washington, DC. And so anyway, while many people are picking [[03:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12907.48s)]
*  through the emails, looking for more evidence that the Clinton campaign worked with the DNC [[03:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12916.039999999999s)]
*  to fix the party primary in her favor against Bernie Sanders, and other people are arguing over [[03:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12921.16s)]
*  whether the email dump was a Russian operation and whether Donald Trump had anything to do with it, [[03:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12927.32s)]
*  some lurkers in the dark corners of the internet were digging up emails that [[03:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12932.92s)]
*  didn't really seem to make a lot of sense if you took them literally, and they decided that these [[03:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12938.28s)]
*  emails were actually coded messages describing nefarious acts. For example, in one email, [[03:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12943.720000000001s)]
*  somebody writes to Podesta that a realtor had found a handkerchief with a map that seems pizza [[03:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12952.92s)]
*  related. Is it yours? If so, I can mail it to you. And Podesta replies that it's his, but nothing to [[03:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12960.28s)]
*  worry about. Well, once you decide that that's a code phrase, because it does seem strange, [[03:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12966.12s)]
*  you know, but once you decide that's a code for something else, and you swap out certain keywords [[03:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12972.92s)]
*  like map and pizza with, I don't know, children and other things, then all you have to do is run [[03:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12977.320000000002s)]
*  a search through the emails for pizza and map and lo and behold, it turns out that out of many [[03:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12984.36s)]
*  thousands of emails, there are a handful that look pretty dark when this circular logic is applied [[03:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12990.279999999999s)]
*  to them. And so now you got tons of people on Reddit and 4chan and Twitter, message boards, [[03:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=12996.199999999999s)]
*  going through every email with a fine-tooth comb, looking for suspected code words and trading [[03:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13001.88s)]
*  theory about what it all means. Well, someone went back to 2011, 2012, years before any of the [[03:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13006.76s)]
*  Pizzagate stuff was ever a thing, and found a tweet from Andrew Breitbart, founder of the website, [[03:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13017.56s)]
*  Breitbart, where he wrote, quote, how Prague guru, progressive guru, John Podesta isn't a household [[03:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13024.039999999999s)]
*  name as a world-class underage sex slave op cover-upper defending unspeakable dregs escapes me. [[03:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13032.76s)]
*  End quote. Freaking shots fired. I mean, again, this is years before the Podesta email leaks, [[03:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13040.359999999999s)]
*  years before anyone had ever mentioned anything to do with this stuff. Now, granted, Breitbart was [[03:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13048.6s)]
*  a conservative bomb thrower, but he was also a businessman who had to worry about things like [[03:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13055.88s)]
*  libel and slander lawsuits. But it's almost as if he was daring John Podesta to take him to court [[03:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13061.08s)]
*  and have it out. Around the same time, after Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York, who was [[03:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13066.92s)]
*  also the husband of Hillary Clinton's longtime top assistant and confidant, Huma Abedin, [[03:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13075.0s)]
*  got caught sexting, and it's insane that his name is Weiner, the matrix breaks more every day, [[03:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13081.960000000001s)]
*  that Anthony Weiner got caught sexting and sending lewd pictures of himself to underage girls, [[03:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13090.12s)]
*  which Andrew Breitbart had been publicly alleging for a while, something for which Breitbart was [[03:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13095.16s)]
*  attacked by Weiner and the Democratic Party machine and much of the mainstream media. [[03:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13100.44s)]
*  Once he got caught and that came out, Andrew Breitbart went on to the Fox news show Red Eye [[03:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13106.039999999999s)]
*  and had this exchange. Hey, Andrew, is this like gotta be the strangest two days of your life? [[03:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13111.48s)]
*  Why are you asking Andrew any questions? Wait, are you the expert? Does he like know stuff about [[03:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13119.32s)]
*  you? You're right. I didn't think of that. Don't go away, Weiner Gabe. [[03:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13125.56s)]
*  Yes, it has been. It has been. All I haven't eaten all day, all I have is [[03:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13133.48s)]
*  adrenaline coursing through my veins. It's the most surreal experience. You have no perspective [[03:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13140.76s)]
*  when something like this happens of this epic level. I haven't looked at the internet [[03:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13147.0s)]
*  to see the comments section. I haven't retweeted any vile hate against me, [[03:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13151.08s)]
*  which is actually a relief. In 48 hours, I'm jonesing for some hate. [[03:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13156.92s)]
*  Well, the interesting thing is it's hard to play ping pong when you don't have any opposition [[03:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13161.96s)]
*  because normally the people that tweet you hate are not tweeting because they've been humiliated. [[03:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13166.44s)]
*  I don't see anything. Why did you change the subject to the sport of ping pong? [[03:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13171.56s)]
*  I don't know. You're weird that way. [[03:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13174.92s)]
*  I am. I want to talk about the extra picture. [[03:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13177.96s)]
*  So back to 2016, these Podesta emails come out and people start finding what they thought was [[03:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13183.16s)]
*  suspicious material and then they see these old Andrew Breitbart statements and they were like, [[03:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13191.08s)]
*  huh, huh, that's weird. Well, the next thing that happened was people noticed an email [[03:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13195.4s)]
*  that mentioned the Podesta is going to, let's call it a party, I guess. They went to an event [[03:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13205.96s)]
*  called Spirit Cooking by the performance artist Marina Abramovich. [[03:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13213.0s)]
*  So people asked, well, what pray tell is Spirit Cooking? And so they went and found out. [[03:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13220.039999999999s)]
*  And what they discovered was a giant vat of jet fuel to pour all over the pizza gate brush fire. [[03:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13228.359999999999s)]
*  The first thing they found were all the pictures of Marina Abramovich dressed in red, posing with [[03:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13236.359999999999s)]
*  occult imagery like a goat's bloody head or snakes wrapped around her head and neck and in her mouth. [[03:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13241.48s)]
*  She had had a relationship and had actually promoted the Brazilian cult leader known as [[03:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13249.4s)]
*  John of God, who you may have seen in the news a few years ago. He's now spending the rest of his [[03:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13254.839999999998s)]
*  life in prison after it turned out that his operation was actually a giant human trafficking [[03:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13260.039999999999s)]
*  and sex slave op that often preyed on young girls. Marina maybe can be forgiven for that little [[03:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13264.76s)]
*  mistake. Oprah and a lot of famous people promoted that guy, so I guess it's fine. [[03:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13272.84s)]
*  And so then someone found details on the event in question. Spirit Cooking was an art installation [[03:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13279.24s)]
*  by the performance artist Marina Abramovich that was apparently used as the setting for a private [[03:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13287.72s)]
*  dinner she gave for some of her donors and supporters. And this is the event to which [[03:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13293.48s)]
*  the Podesta brothers were invited. I use the term art very loosely here, although from everything [[03:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13297.32s)]
*  I've ever seen that is the case with pretty much all performance art. Sorry if there's any performance [[03:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13303.72s)]
*  artist out there. I am an admitted Philistine when it comes to all contemporary art, so who knows, [[03:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13309.88s)]
*  maybe there's something truly beautiful hidden just beneath the surface of something like [[03:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13315.8s)]
*  Abramovich's Spirit Cooking which takes up several rooms decorated with cryptic sayings [[03:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13320.2s)]
*  painted in pig's blood on white walls. Maybe there's something beautiful hidden in there. [[03:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13325.720000000001s)]
*  Up on the white walls painted in pig's blood, mix fresh breast milk with fresh sperm milk, [[03:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13332.36s)]
*  drink on earthquake nights. In one corner is an effigy of a human infant, [[03:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13338.68s)]
*  completely covered in pig's blood as if a bucket of the stuff had been thrown on it. [[03:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13346.599999999999s)]
*  On another wall with a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand, eat the pain. [[03:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13352.84s)]
*  A lot of this is just silly art school edgelord bullshit, but at one Spirit Cooking event attended [[03:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13362.199999999999s)]
*  by Lady Gaga there are pictures of her with Abramovich eating something off of a mock [[03:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13368.679999999998s)]
*  corpse lying in a naked tub of what's supposed to be blood. Another wall, fresh morning urine [[03:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13374.76s)]
*  sprinkled over nightmare dreams. In another room small dolls are positioned as if they're copulating. [[03:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13382.04s)]
*  You get the idea. Well, with people already spun up, [[03:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13389.32s)]
*  this got merged with the code talk theories and the Breitbart stuff and turned into a much more [[03:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13396.68s)]
*  sweeping theory, not just about pedophilia but satanic ritualistic pedophilia involving the wealthy [[03:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13402.6s)]
*  and powerful. People start trawling through the emails looking for any mention of the word pizza [[03:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13409.24s)]
*  and they come across this other guy named James Oliphantis and his Washington DC restaurant [[03:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13415.640000000001s)]
*  Comet Ping Pong Pizza. And that also didn't help matters because it turned out that Oliphantis was [[03:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13422.519999999999s)]
*  not only a democratic donor and former boyfriend of Democrat operative and founder of Media Matters [[03:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13430.199999999999s)]
*  David Brock, but somehow despite being a humble pizza salesman was listed by GQ magazine as one [[03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13436.759999999998s)]
*  of the 50 most powerful people in Washington DC. I don't know. And then it turned out that he used [[03:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13445.64s)]
*  a picture of an old Roman statue of Antonis, the boy lover of the emperor Hadrian, as his Instagram [[03:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13453.8s)]
*  picture. And that there were pictures of things like small children taped to tables and other [[03:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13460.92s)]
*  pictures and comments that without any context looked pretty strange. And that there were [[03:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13468.359999999999s)]
*  pictures of things like small children taped to tables and other pictures that without any context [[03:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13473.64s)]
*  looked pretty strange. And that another pizza joint two doors down from Comet Ping Pong called [[03:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13477.64s)]
*  Besta Pizza, which is now closed, had as its logo a pizza slice that was styled into a sort of [[03:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13481.4s)]
*  triangular spiral that declassified FBI files show is a symbol commonly used among pedophiles [[03:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13488.84s)]
*  to signal their preferences to each other. So none of this helped. [[03:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13496.199999999999s)]
*  People found out that Comet Ping Pong hosted musical acts that have a sort of, [[03:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13500.04s)]
*  I don't know, a sort of surrealist creepy David Lynch meets Pink Flamingo's aesthetic, I guess. [[03:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13509.400000000001s)]
*  One of them was a strange outfit called Heavy Breathing, the lead singer, female lead singer, [[03:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13516.04s)]
*  who always wore a mask and went by the name Majestic Ape, who apparently jokes about pedophiles [[03:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13522.28s)]
*  and several of her songs. And the band cuts these creepy, very lurid, surrealist promo videos for [[03:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13528.68s)]
*  their albums and shows. You know, it's the kind of thing that if you just see it, like today, [[03:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13537.24s)]
*  if I were to show it to you, you would just roll your eyes and it's just, again, Edge Lorde art [[03:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13543.0s)]
*  school bullshit. But it's also the kind of thing that if you're already three quarters of the way [[03:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13547.800000000001s)]
*  down the rabbit hole after spending all night going through threads and all that crap, [[03:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13553.16s)]
*  going through threads about spirit cooking and cheese pizza, are going to add more fuel to the fire. [[03:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13558.04s)]
*  Another band hosted at Comet Ping Pong Pizza, which markets itself as a place for kids, [[03:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13565.080000000002s)]
*  another band that they hosted was called Sex Stains, and one of their music videos, [[03:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13571.640000000001s)]
*  one of the only two music videos they have, as far as I could tell, shows the band singing and dancing [[03:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13577.0s)]
*  in a room full of children's toys, one of which is a giant block with the symbol that the FBI says [[03:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13582.2s)]
*  is the one pedophiles use to identify themselves to each other. Basically a spiral, but instead of in [[03:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13589.480000000001s)]
*  the shape of a circle, it's in the shape of a triangle. The music video actually ends with [[03:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13595.08s)]
*  one of the singers seated by herself in the room next to the block with the symbol, facing it, [[03:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13601.0s)]
*  sweating and holding out her hands in some weird manner that is, I don't know what she's doing with [[03:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13607.24s)]
*  her hands, but it's clearly directed at that block or at the symbol. And so like I said, [[03:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13614.52s)]
*  if you're already in this mode, you know, it's 3 a.m., you've been up all night reading Reddit [[03:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=13621.4s)]

*  the media like ben swan did you get your accounts banned on social media well when that's how these [[03:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14399.32s)]
*  things are handled and to be clear i get why they're handled this way they're handled this [[04:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14405.96s)]
*  way because the guy with the pictures of dead kids on his wall is not going to have an explanation [[04:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14410.599999999999s)]
*  for that that's going to satisfy most of us so as soon as he starts talking about it and trying to [[04:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14415.64s)]
*  explain he's already lost again this is america so most people who don't work for the big tech [[04:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14421.16s)]
*  companies interpret the first amendment pretty broadly if you want to paint dead tied up abused [[04:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14429.48s)]
*  half-naked kids paint dead tied up abused half-naked kids if you want to pay a small [[04:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14435.8s)]
*  fortune to hang them on the wall of your living room knock yourself out but you're not having a [[04:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14441.32s)]
*  hand in determining education policy in america you're not helping decide whether it's okay to [[04:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14447.0s)]
*  perform gender reassignment surgery on eight-year-olds when you have paintings of tied up dead eight-year-olds [[04:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14454.119999999999s)]
*  on your wall you lose your position on a local school board for having sexually [[04:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14460.12s)]
*  suggestive pictures of dead kids on your wall [[04:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14466.52s)]
*  and so this really begs a larger question which gets to an aspect of the jeffrey epstein story [[04:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14471.800000000001s)]
*  that i think is really difficult for normal people it's difficult for me for a long time [[04:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14478.28s)]
*  the question of what exactly is going on with these people in elevated political circles in d.c. high [[04:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14483.72s)]
*  society that this guy would feel comfortable hanging these pictures on the wall of a living room [[04:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14491.56s)]
*  where he hosts parties in which he showed off in a d.c. society magazine if i was into pictures of [[04:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14497.960000000001s)]
*  dead abused kids i would at least hide them before company came over i would certainly put them away [[04:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14505.8s)]
*  before the magazine photographer showed up to profile my house i mean d.c. is a cutthroat city [[04:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14512.6s)]
*  where people gladly take any little thing out of context if they can to destroy somebody else [[04:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14519.880000000001s)]
*  but apparently pictures of dead kids and weird blood ritual dinner parties are just so normal [[04:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14526.2s)]
*  that you can advertise them in magazines and throw parties in the rooms where they're hanging [[04:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14531.16s)]
*  and so let's finally start to get around to jeffrey epstein i know that's what we're here [[04:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14537.560000000001s)]
*  to talk about some of you are out there saying okay fine so these people are freaks uh but what [[04:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14540.68s)]
*  does that have to do with jeffrey epstein we've been waiting several months for this episode [[04:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14547.32s)]
*  well some people think it has everything to do with jeffrey epstein you know conspiracy theories [[04:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14552.28s)]
*  tend to grow like mold until they congeal together into one big mess once people who were already on [[04:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14557.0s)]
*  this train remembered that bill clinton who john podesta worked for in the white house for eight [[04:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14565.0s)]
*  years and whose wife john podesta was running a presidential campaign for once people remember [[04:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14569.72s)]
*  that bill clinton was apparently good enough buddies with jeffrey epstein to show up on the [[04:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14577.8s)]
*  flight logs of his private plane 26 times they said well yeah of course that makes total sense [[04:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14582.84s)]
*  and so epstein got taken up into the larger theory tying all this together into one big plot [[04:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14591.72s)]
*  and now to be clear i don't buy that i don't think that's true i certainly don't have any evidence [[04:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14597.48s)]
*  that it's true my point in bringing all this up is a little bit different is to paint a picture [[04:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14601.88s)]
*  since that's one of the themes today apparently a picture of a world where a guy like jeffrey [[04:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14608.52s)]
*  epstein could operate as long as he did out in the open and still get fawning attention from [[04:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14615.24s)]
*  many of the richest and most powerful people in the country [[04:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14623.24s)]
*  because it's not like people didn't know what jeffrey epstein was up to [[04:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14627.880000000001s)]
*  you know he didn't name his private plane the lolita express other people gave it that name [[04:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14631.720000000001s)]
*  the lolita for those of you who aren't up on what literary people consider high art is a 1955 novel [[04:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14638.84s)]
*  about a man who kidnaps and repeatedly rapes a 12 year old girl for two years and the author [[04:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14645.480000000001s)]
*  was inspired by a real case from 1948 in which a serial child molester kidnapped a 12 year old [[04:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14652.2s)]
*  girl and traveled across the country having his way with her and jeffrey epstein's airplane was [[04:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14657.880000000001s)]
*  nicknamed by other people the lolita express people knew what was going on when jeffrey epstein was [[04:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14663.400000000001s)]
*  arrested and jailed for exploiting underage girls in the mid-2000s i don't know how old a lot of [[04:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14673.16s)]
*  you guys were but that was a very public affair you know if you were watching if you were focused [[04:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14679.16s)]
*  on like football games or watching barney the dinosaur or whatever you might not have been [[04:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14684.52s)]
*  plugged into it but the people who were in that world were very plugged into it it was very very [[04:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14688.6s)]
*  well known a very very public affair nobody who had the slightest idea who jeffrey epstein was [[04:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14693.8s)]
*  at all was unaware of what happened well bill clinton rode on the lolita express 26 times [[04:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14699.48s)]
*  one of epstein's partners in crime a guy he did all this stuff with for sure a guy who ran a [[04:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14706.92s)]
*  modeling agency that he used as a front for sex trafficking named jean-luc brunel more on him later [[04:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14713.08s)]
*  he only rode jeffrey epstein's plane 25 times this is a guy who's very close to epstein a guy who [[04:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14720.04s)]
*  visited epstein 70 times during his 13-month stay in jail more than once a week even though [[04:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14726.6s)]
*  once a week even though epstein's deal let him out on work release for 12 hours a day six days [[04:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14732.92s)]
*  a week and so a guy that close to him who was definitely involved in epstein sex crimes rode [[04:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14737.8s)]
*  on his private plane fewer times than bill clinton now if i darryl cooper if i wanted to meet [[04:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14745.48s)]
*  with bill clinton or bill gates i assume that somebody on their staff would do a google search [[04:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14753.24s)]
*  and go to bill and say hey boss uh we found a reddit thread where some non calls him a fascist [[04:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14759.96s)]
*  gonna have to take a pass on this meeting but apparently running a google search and finding [[04:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14766.839999999998s)]
*  countless articles in major publications describing epstein's conviction for child prostitution [[04:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14772.359999999999s)]
*  not a deal breaker there's a picture of bill clinton in an airport with a big smile on his [[04:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14779.24s)]
*  face getting a massage from shantay davis one of the girls epstein was abusing and who he was [[04:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14786.12s)]
*  using as his personal masseuse at the time now i'm not saying bill clinton is a pedophile although [[04:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14791.960000000001s)]
*  i will say he is almost certainly a rapist several friends of oneida broderick back up her specific [[04:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14799.480000000001s)]

*  i'm not saying he did anything nefarious with jeffrey epstein but i will say that if it's true [[04:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14823.88s)]
*  that epstein was in the business of blackmailing powerful men by putting them in compromising [[04:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14829.8s)]
*  positions with underage girls and he couldn't get bill clinton a likely rapist with so little [[04:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14834.599999999999s)]
*  impulse control that he couldn't wait to get out of the oval office before hooking up with his 18 [[04:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14841.64s)]
*  year old white house intern if he couldn't get bill clinton when epstein had over two dozen [[04:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14846.359999999999s)]
*  plane trips including ones to bangkok thailand and his private sex island if he couldn't get [[04:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14853.88s)]
*  some dirt on that guy under those circumstances then he was terrible at his job to get back to [[04:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14859.32s)]
*  my point you know when we regular folks ask what to us seem like pretty basic questions [[04:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14867.24s)]
*  like how could a guy everyone knows went to jail for sexually abusing underage girls [[04:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14880.28s)]
*  continue to operate in high society like it's all good when we ask those questions we often [[04:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14886.92s)]
*  find it hard to come up with any good answers and so many people settle for absurd ones like bill [[04:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14892.44s)]
*  clinton saying oh i just didn't know anything about epstein's past it's just totally absurd [[04:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14899.720000000001s)]
*  you know but who's gonna call him on it some podcaster or harvard professor and celebrity [[04:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14905.960000000001s)]

*  literally said that but regular people you know we don't want to think about this stuff [[04:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14924.44s)]
*  it's disgusting and it all just seems too unbelievable because regular people [[04:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14931.08s)]
*  we don't know anybody who could hop on to a guy's private plane named after a book about a pedophile [[04:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14935.960000000001s)]

*  regular people hear these stories and they think oh look sure these things do happen you know i've [[04:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14954.36s)]
*  seen the stories in the newspapers but the people who are involved the people who do these things [[04:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14959.560000000001s)]
*  are very rare aberrations you know you see these people are monsters jeffrey epstein was a monster [[04:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14965.320000000002s)]

*  inclinations of many people of that social class not only in america but in many countries [[04:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14978.279999999999s)]
*  and not only today but going back a long time the obvious answer is that to those people he is not a [[04:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14985.8s)]
*  monster if you hopped onto that plane after just coming from dinner off a bloody corpse's belly [[04:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=14994.6s)]

*  group we're talking about this is what some people think and that this mega group we're talking about [[04:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16439.88s)]
*  already existed in 1997 when those calls were intercepted talking about mega and only came out [[04:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16444.36s)]

*  not an individual maybe it's a code name for a group or a method maybe i have a more straightforward [[04:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16460.92s)]
*  hypothesis i think i think the guys who founded the mega group were just basically trolling the [[04:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16469.0s)]
*  clinton administration and you have to understand the administration made the investigation [[04:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16473.96s)]
*  of alleged israeli spying very public like they could have kept it under wraps they made it very [[04:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16479.399999999998s)]

*  spy network what what are the israelis up to is it is it a leaker in the cia and this was done at [[04:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16500.36s)]
*  a time when the u.s was brokering negotiations between the israelis and palestinians so the whole [[04:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16505.56s)]
*  effort could be and likely was seen by the israelis as an attempt by the clinton administration [[04:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16510.36s)]
*  to put pressure on the israelis to make concessions well once clinton was a lame duck in the middle of [[04:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16515.56s)]

*  les wexner i mentioned that one of the companies wexner owned was victoria secret [[04:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16672.36s)]
*  one of the things that epstein would do is use his position with wexner to pose as a victoria secret [[04:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16680.12s)]
*  talent scout to try to get into bed with aspiring models basically a modeling industry version of [[04:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16686.36s)]

*  it's so obvious there would be jokes about the casting couch or going to see the producer [[04:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16729.399999999998s)]

*  in fact epstein had provided the seed money for brunel to open the modeling agency that served [[04:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16777.4s)]
*  as the hub for all this and people had known all this for years by the way back in 1988 [[04:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16782.600000000002s)]
*  the show 60 minutes did an expose on brunel and another modeling executive [[04:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16788.68s)]
*  and aired witness testimony about how brunel created a culture where women were routinely [[04:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16793.320000000003s)]

*  jean-luc brunel apparently believed he was next because he immediately went into hiding [[04:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16804.04s)]
*  he was eventually arrested trying to flee the country and charged with rape of minors by the [[04:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16808.68s)]
*  french government but can you guys guess i'll give you three seconds to guess oh you all got [[04:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16813.72s)]

*  shocking i know well apparently when brunel wasn't around to provide these girls epstein had to [[04:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16828.84s)]
*  use other means and luckily for him his boss patron client godfather guy les wexner owned [[04:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16835.88s)]
*  victoria's secret in the mid 1990s two victoria's secret executives got word that this guy who they [[04:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16841.64s)]

*  with their boss les wexner they started getting reports that epstein was doing the same thing with [[04:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16854.6s)]
*  victoria's secret models and would-be models posing as a talent scout in order to sexually abuse them [[04:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16859.399999999998s)]

*  well how could a relative nobody a relative nobody money manager or whatever like jeffrey epstein [[04:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16874.84s)]

*  i don't know why would a guy like wexner entrust his fortune to a guy like epstein rather than some [[04:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16887.879999999997s)]

*  estimated to be worth 70 million dollars at the time of epstein's arrest don't know that either [[04:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16908.92s)]

*  the number one spot being les wexner's residence was also formally owned by wexner and so was [[04:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16920.92s)]
*  epstein's private plane which was not some little cessna or leerjet by the way it was a custom equipped [[04:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=16926.28s)]

*  financial affairs and it corresponded to a period in which mr epstein came to control or own valuable [[04:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17157.56s)]

*  but many people have speculated that epstein might have some kind of extremely compromising [[04:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17185.64s)]
*  blackmail on wexner because like what what is the better what is the best explanation for all this [[04:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17189.48s)]
*  you know i don't really understand it and as far as i can tell uh you know pretty much nobody [[04:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17195.8s)]
*  else does including people who are again very close to les wexner but to circle back that was [[04:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17200.84s)]
*  kind of a long roundabout i was saying that i found it very interesting that the sex trafficking [[04:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17208.36s)]
*  operation nexium was taken down right around the same time that epstein was arrested given that [[04:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17214.199999999997s)]

*  mega group with jeffrey epstein's sugar daddy les wexner epstein's operation in my opinion i [[04:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17226.28s)]
*  a lot of people's opinion almost certainly had to do with sexual blackmail and although i haven't [[04:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17234.84s)]
*  seen any explicit evidence of it nexium seems like an ideal outfit to run something like that [[04:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17240.04s)]
*  so these two weird you know sexually exploitative sex slave operations are taken down at the same [[04:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17247.24s)]
*  time and the people who run them are each one direct step down from the two guys who co-founded [[04:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17254.920000000002s)]

*  story and i'll probably do a series on 80s intelligence operations one of these days so [[04:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17366.2s)]
*  i'm going to leave it there but another epstein connection to israeli intelligence was through [[04:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17370.280000000002s)]

*  because in 2014 epstein bankrolled a startup called reporti homeland security now called carbine 911 [[04:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17455.64s)]

*  it's a very complicated story but the software itself from what i can tell is basically [[04:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17683.8s)]
*  a networked database that would allow local police departments the courts federal law [[04:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17691.239999999998s)]

*  thing to do back then before you know the internet was fully set up well the owners of the company [[04:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17705.88s)]
*  who developed the software said that the software was simply stolen from them [[04:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17712.120000000003s)]
*  by the department of justice after they developed it and they received at least some vindication [[04:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17716.68s)]
*  for that accusation in court even the house judiciary committee that looked into the matter [[04:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17721.56s)]
*  found quote there appears to be strong evidence as indicated by the findings in two federal court [[04:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17726.120000000003s)]

*  the case as well as according to ari ben menashe was for the u.s government in doing this was to [[04:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17757.48s)]
*  market and sell the software to foreign countries so that once it was installed and in use [[04:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17764.28s)]
*  built-in back doors could be used to infiltrate their computer networks [[04:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17769.8s)]
*  which all sounds like a crazy spy movie but then you have to remember cases like crypto ag [[04:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17774.039999999997s)]
*  crypto ag was a swiss firm that manufactured encryption gear founded in the 1950s whose owner [[04:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17781.079999999998s)]
*  had made a deal with william friedman the national security agency's chief of cryptography [[04:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17788.039999999997s)]
*  to provide the u.s government with technical information that would allow us to crack the [[04:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17794.2s)]
*  codes of anybody using the machines as well as which countries and organizations were using the [[04:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17798.36s)]
*  machines well in 1970 the cia just got rid of the middleman and with west german intelligence [[04:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17802.600000000002s)]
*  the west german intelligence agency bnd secretly purchased crypto ag itself through front companies [[04:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17810.36s)]
*  the cia bought out the german share in 1993 and from then on ran the company itself [[04:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17818.92s)]
*  and crypto ag became by far the largest manufacturer and distributor of cryptography [[04:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17824.92s)]
*  gear in the world being the chief provider for dozens of countries corporations just [[04:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17830.6s)]
*  all of which the u.s was able to listen in on the entire time you know we're talking iran libya [[04:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17838.6s)]
*  saudi arabia eastern europe dozens of countries and the cia continued to operate that company [[04:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17843.72s)]
*  until 2018 so you can imagine that they have this incredibly important intelligence collection [[04:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17851.4s)]
*  program like the crypto ag thing going on but now in the you know in the late 80s when this is [[04:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17860.920000000002s)]
*  happening this new computer technology is starting to catch on and people whose job it is to see which [[04:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17865.64s)]
*  way the wind's blowing say that this is the future and so it becomes plausible that the u.s [[04:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17872.28s)]
*  government wanted to sell this software around the world with new digital backdoors to get around [[04:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17878.12s)]
*  encryption that crypto ag's operations you know didn't deal with they weren't about digital stuff [[04:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17883.64s)]
*  i mean of course we know the nsa has basically done that in the years since the the only question [[04:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17889.559999999998s)]
*  is whether the promise software was stolen as part of an early attempt to do it i think it's i think [[04:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17894.12s)]
*  it's plausible it does seem strange that the u.s government would try to steal a private company [[04:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17899.4s)]
*  software but of course if it stayed in private hands and you know this is the kind of software [[04:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17905.16s)]
*  that would need like regular updates it would need to be customized for this country customized [[04:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17911.24s)]
*  differently for that country and you know whoever made it was going to have an ongoing relationship [[04:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17915.72s)]
*  with the clients and so if it stayed in private hands they would have to be in on the scam if [[04:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17920.84s)]
*  indeed it was a scam well according to several witnesses at the time [[04:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17924.92s)]
*  during the court cases and congressional investigations the u.s government provided a [[04:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=17931.239999999998s)]

*  his lawyers describe him as being in good spirits and they still don't believe he committed suicide [[05:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19010.600000000002s)]
*  they were spending the lawyers i'm talking about were spending eight hours a day with epstein [[05:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19017.08s)]
*  discussing his legal strategy because he'd pled not guilty and plan to fight the case [[05:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19021.88s)]
*  it's not like he didn't have any case to make i mean the federal government despite all the [[05:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19027.48s)]
*  evidence it was out there the federal government had given him a non-prosecution agreement [[05:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19031.72s)]

*  it wasn't nearly as damning of as what they'd had on him back in 2008 and that time he'd managed [[05:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19042.04s)]
*  to get just 13 months in jail where he got his own wing of the jail with his own private security [[05:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19047.96s)]

*  he served that easy sentence he was right back to hanging with bill gates and ehud barak and living [[05:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19065.96s)]
*  in his mansion and going to his private sex temple on his island we're supposed to believe [[05:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19072.52s)]
*  that he managed to commit suicide in a prison where nobody's committed suicide for decades [[05:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19078.36s)]
*  two weeks after he was found unconscious with neck injuries on his floor saying that his cellmate a [[05:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19086.2s)]
*  juiced up corrupt cop charged with multiple murder quadruple murder had assaulted him [[05:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19092.28s)]
*  which the jail apparently believed at least a bit because they transferred him to another cell [[05:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19098.44s)]
*  with a different cellmate in case it was a suicide attempt the jail ordered that Epstein was required [[05:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19103.239999999998s)]
*  to always be with a cellmate and that the guards had to check in on him every 30 minutes [[05:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19108.92s)]
*  and on august 9th for reasons nobody can explain his cellmate was removed from the cell [[05:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19114.76s)]
*  from the cell and then oopsie the two guards on duty fell asleep and failed to check on him for [[05:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19121.16s)]
*  several hours and then epstein who's six feet tall somehow managed to hang himself from the lower bunk [[05:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19128.2s)]
*  of his bed and hanged himself with enough force to break four small bones in his neck that several [[05:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19134.92s)]
*  forensic experts have said very rarely break when people are hanged usually only by strangulation [[05:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19141.8s)]
*  and he hanged himself from the bottom bunk with enough force to break four rarely broken neck [[05:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19148.920000000002s)]
*  bones but not with enough force to knock over the bottles the small bottles and medicine containers [[05:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19153.72s)]
*  standing upright on the rail of the top bunk when police took photos of the scene in the immediate [[05:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19159.88s)]
*  aftermath the two surveillance cameras that were monitoring the outside of his cell [[05:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19165.56s)]
*  ah they malfunctioned it's just the darndest thing those you know you know how technology is [[05:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19173.16s)]
*  and all this under the watch of a cia connected attorney general whose dad wrote pulp sci-fi [[05:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19181.56s)]
*  novels about planets whose elites were engaged in mass scale sex slavery of the commoners [[05:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19187.88s)]
*  and who gave epstein his very first job and i don't know how much of that is relevant [[05:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19193.16s)]
*  i just know that for the official story to be true all of it has to be irrelevant [[05:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19198.04s)]
*  and i think that's a bit of a stretch [[05:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19204.12s)]
*  okay guys [[05:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19208.76s)]
*  i'm sorry i took so long to get this out this story makes me insane i really have not wanted [[05:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19212.76s)]
*  to think or talk about it and hopefully i won't have to for a while there is more to this story [[05:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19218.84s)]
*  there always is uh but i am going to leave it here the final thing i'll say is you know all [[05:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19224.92s)]
*  this talking here about israel about jewish american billionaires and jewish american spies [[05:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19233.48s)]
*  i know that these things can be touchy topics in a way that talking about russian american [[05:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19241.079999999998s)]
*  billionaires or chinese american spies is not so i will just say one last time we are not talking [[05:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19245.0s)]
*  about any people in general or any ethnicities or even countries we're talking about governments [[05:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19251.08s)]
*  and specifically about intelligence agencies this isn't about jews it isn't even about israel and [[05:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19259.480000000003s)]
*  it's not even really about the israeli government or the american government for that matter because [[05:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19264.440000000002s)]
*  99.9 percent of even high ranking people in those governments have no idea when stuff like this goes [[05:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19269.72s)]
*  on this is about specific acts of tightly organized highly secretive intelligence agencies [[05:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19275.800000000003s)]
*  and so the final thing i'll say is that there is a reason beyond government secrecy that someone [[05:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19286.84s)]
*  like jeffrey epstein could get away with something like this for so long and that is that he moved [[05:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19294.36s)]
*  around in a slice of the world where people did not find what they were seeing particularly [[05:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrm8aOmQg-o&t=19301.08s)]
