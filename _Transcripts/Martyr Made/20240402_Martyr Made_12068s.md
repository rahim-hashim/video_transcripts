Video Description: Hi everybody. This is the audio version of a six-part essay series called Blacks and Jews. I wrote it for my Substack a while back, so if it sounds like I’m reading instead of speaking naturally, it’s because in this case I am. I decided to release this to everyone on the main feed because, in light of the recent uproar and brewing Democratic Party civil war over the Israel-Palestine conflict, it’s suddenly become quite timely. Black and Jewish Americans were uniquely united until the late 1960s, when the civil rights movement was subsumed by a Third Worldist outlook that caused the Black Panthers and other activists to turn on the State of Israel, and then on American Jews. It precipitated a split in the so-called Black-Jewish alliance which had been the backbone of the civil rights movement during its glory years, and led to some of the worst outbursts of public antisemitism in American history. The intra-left wing conflict over the current conflict in Gaza is not a new story, and in fact is an example of scabs being torn off old wounds that had barely begun to heal. I wrote this series as I was preparing the most recent episode of Whose America, Inner City Blues, so those of you who’ve heard that will be familiar with some of the material, but there’s also a lot of material that wasn’t in that episode.

As I said, this was previously released on my Substack (https://subscribe.martyrmade.com/) , so if you enjoy this kind of content maybe you’ll show a little holiday cheer and help support the podcast by becoming a subscriber for just $5 p/month or $50 p/year. This is a 100% listener-funded show, I don’t have sponsors or any other kind of funding except what you guys contribute, so your generosity is greatly appreciated.

# Blacks and Jews (Complete Series)
**Martyr Made:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U)
*  Hey everybody, this is Darrell Cooper, this is the Martyr Made Podcast, and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=0.0s)]
*  audio version of a six-part essay series I did a while back called Blacks and Jews. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=8.42s)]
*  I wrote this for my substack a while ago, so if it sounds like I'm reading instead of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=15.32s)]
*  speaking naturally, it's because this is an essay series, so in this case I am. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=21.28s)]
*  I decided to release this to everybody on the main feed because in light of the recent [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=26.44s)]
*  uproar and the brewing Democratic Party-Civil War over the Israel-Palestine conflict, it's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=32.72s)]
*  suddenly become quite timely again. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  Black and Jewish Americans were uniquely united socially and politically until the late 1960s, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  when the Civil Rights Movement was subsumed by a Third Worldist outlook that caused the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=50.24s)]
*  Black Panthers and other activist groups to turn on the state of Israel and then on [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=55.04s)]
*  American Jews themselves. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=61.0s)]
*  It precipitated a split in the so-called Black-Jewish alliance, which had been the backbone of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  Civil Rights Movement during its glory years, and it led to some of the worst outbursts [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=69.6s)]
*  of public anti-Semitism in American history. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=75.38s)]
*  The intra-left-wing conflict over the current war in Gaza is not a new story, in other words. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  And in fact is an example of scabs being torn off old wounds that had just barely begun to heal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=85.0s)]
*  I wrote this series as I was preparing the most recent episode of Who's America? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=92.52s)]
*  Inner City Blues. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  So those of you who have heard that will be familiar with some of the material here, but [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=98.56s)]
*  there's also a lot of material that was not in that episode and it's got a different focus. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=102.76s)]
*  As I said, this episode was previously, or this essay series with the audio versions [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=109.04s)]
*  I should say, was previously released on my Substack, which can be found at martyrmade.substack.com. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=114.48s)]
*  So if you enjoy this kind of content, maybe you'll show a little holiday cheer and help [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=122.6s)]
*  support the podcast by becoming a subscriber for just $5 a month or $50 a year. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=126.7s)]
*  This is a 100% listener-funded show. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=133.0s)]
*  I don't have sponsors or any other kind of funding except what you guys contribute, so [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=136.28s)]
*  your generosity is greatly appreciated. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=141.5s)]
*  It's the only thing that allows me to keep doing this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=144.76s)]
*  Now obviously this is a controversial topic, but I did my very best to handle it honestly and fairly. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  But if you have any questions or comments or criticisms, you know where to find me. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=155.28s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=161.64s)]
*  I'm content to die for my beliefs. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=163.64s)]
*  So cut off my head and make me a martyr. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=168.64s)]
*  The people will always remember it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=174.64s)]
*  No. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=178.64s)]
*  They will forget. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=180.64s)]
*  Where? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=192.64s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=194.64s)]
*  But its reference is to something that transcends all things. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=197.64s)]
*  I must tell you why we must tear ourselves apart for this small question of religion. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=206.64s)]
*  The Blacks [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=213.64s)]
*  Long before the recent hullabaloo surrounding Kanye West's self-immolation on the steps [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=217.64s)]
*  of the Anti-Defamation League's headquarters, much ink had been spilled over the complicated [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=222.64s)]
*  relationship between American blacks and Jews, though not much recently. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=227.64s)]
*  When every so often a black celebrity hits the news for saying something that causes [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=233.64s)]
*  to feel threatened or offended, the press treats each story as hermetically sealed off [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=238.64s)]
*  from the others. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=243.64s)]
*  At all costs do they avoid suggesting that the incidents might be in any way connected, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=244.64s)]
*  or that they could reflect genuine friction between the two groups, rather than merely [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=249.64s)]
*  the ignorance of one misguided individual. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=254.64s)]
*  The Kanye spectacle is a re-eruption of an old volcano, long dormant and perhaps thought extinct. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=258.64s)]
*  Soon after Mount Kanye blew its top, NBA star Kyrie Irving got in trouble. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=266.64s)]
*  Before them were Jay-Z, Ice Cube, Professor Griff, Lupe Fiasco, Nick Cannon, Whoopi Goldberg, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=272.64s)]
*  and many more. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=280.64s)]
*  Cannon was fired from his TV job in 2020 for promoting the theory that black people are [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=282.64s)]
*  descended from the biblical Israelites, rather than from Ham, the cursed son of Noah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=288.64s)]
*  Ye, Irving, and Cube also came under fire for promoting this original version of Wakanda [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=293.64s)]
*  Forever. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=299.64s)]
*  Griff, Fiasco, and Jay-Z went the traditional route by suggesting that Jews own and control [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=300.64s)]
*  the recording industry that signed their checks. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=306.64s)]
*  It is comparatively rare for celebrities of other races to make such a glaring faux pas [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=310.64s)]
*  on the topic of Jews. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=316.64s)]
*  It took a bottle of Jim Beam and sleep deprivation for Mel Gibson to join the rappers and agree [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=318.64s)]
*  out loud that Jews control the entertainment industry. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=323.64s)]
*  So what gives? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=327.64s)]
*  It turns out that there is a history here, but our understandable reluctance in America [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=329.64s)]
*  to talk honestly about groups as groups has caused it to be mostly forgotten, even by [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=335.64s)]
*  the principles. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=341.64s)]
*  Until about 100 years ago, black and Jewish Americans still had little experience with [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=343.64s)]
*  each other. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=348.64s)]
*  Most blacks still lived in the rural south, while almost all Jews lived in the urban north. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=349.64s)]
*  In antebellum times, black slaves identified their plight with that of the ancient Hebrews [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=355.64s)]
*  toiling under the whips of Pharaoh, and Negro spirituals expressed their hope that they [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=361.64s)]
*  would one day be led out of captivity into their own promised land. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=366.64s)]
*  By the turn of the century, the railroads had been built and word had begun to trickle [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=371.64s)]
*  down to some southern blacks that their promised land was just a short train ride to the north, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=376.64s)]
*  and soon the stampede was on. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=381.64s)]
*  Between 1915 and 1960, some six to seven million black Americans migrated from the rural south [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=385.64s)]
*  to the big cities of the north and west, one of the largest mass migrations in human history [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=392.64s)]
*  and one whose consequences defined much of American domestic politics in the 20th century. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=398.64s)]
*  Baltimore, Philly, Brooklyn, Harlem, Detroit, St. Louis, Chicago, Oakland. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=405.64s)]
*  When the First World War began in 1914, all of the cities that became well known in the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=413.64s)]
*  20th century as hubs of African American life still had virtually no black people living [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=418.64s)]
*  in them. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=424.64s)]
*  Even the Ku Klux Klan had shifted its focus. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=425.64s)]
*  The Second KKK was founded in 1915 in Atlanta, but failed to really catch on in the south. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=429.64s)]
*  Instead, its strongholds were in the west and midwest, in cities like Chicago, Indy, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=436.64s)]
*  Cleveland, and Portland. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=442.64s)]
*  Like the early progressive movement, the KKK of this period was a wasp reaction to the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=444.64s)]
*  disorder brought about by mass immigration. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=449.64s)]
*  The cities had multiplied in size in the blink of an eye, and many had been taken over [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=452.64s)]
*  by corrupt ethnic political machines. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=457.64s)]
*  Millions of immigrants, southern European Catholics, eastern European Jews, central [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=460.64s)]
*  European free thinkers, huddled in hastily constructed ghettos that seemed to emanate [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=466.64s)]
*  crime, vice, and disorder. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=472.64s)]
*  These were the neighborhoods into which migrating southern blacks were funneled when they [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=476.64s)]
*  made their way to America's great cities. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=481.64s)]
*  And they lived cheek by jowl with Irish, Italians, Poles, Jews, and others who'd only [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=485.64s)]
*  recently arrived themselves. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=491.64s)]
*  In the early years of the Great Migration, blacks were not seen to be invading white [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=495.64s)]
*  neighborhoods, but Irish, Italian, Polish, and Jewish neighborhoods. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=500.64s)]
*  If, as time went on, nobody spoke of Italian black relations or Irish black relations the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=506.64s)]
*  way they continued to do about Jewish black relations, that is because Jews alone among [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=513.64s)]
*  European ethnics retained a meaningful sense of group identity, while the others melted [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=518.64s)]
*  into the generic American white population. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=524.64s)]
*  From the beginning, Jews were relatively more tolerant than the other Euro-ethnics of black [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=528.64s)]
*  migrants. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=534.64s)]
*  What they heard about Jim Crow in the South reminded them of their parents' tales about [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=535.64s)]
*  the pale of settlement. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=540.64s)]
*  Blacks had been slaves in America just as Jews had been slaves in Egypt, and both had [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=542.64s)]
*  survived since in their own forms of exile. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=547.64s)]
*  A strong strain of political radicalism told the same story to those Jews who were unmatched [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=551.64s)]
*  by Judaism. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=556.64s)]
*  Both groups had gone through their own ordeal of integration in the American cities they [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=558.64s)]
*  now called home. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=563.64s)]
*  The Eastern European Jews who began arriving in the 1880s were seen as uncouth, immoral, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=565.64s)]
*  and potentially dangerous by the well-assimilated handful of German Jews who proceeded them [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=571.64s)]
*  to America. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=576.64s)]
*  Those German Jews were afraid that the unruly behavior of their Eastern cousins would ignite [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=578.64s)]
*  the flame of anti-Semitism in America, and went as far as setting up training centers [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=584.64s)]
*  for newly arrived Ausjuden to be taught how to behave in their new country. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=589.64s)]
*  Similarly, when Southern blacks arrived in the Northern cities, they encountered very [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=594.64s)]
*  small groups of well-assimilated blacks who had lived there for years and looked down [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=600.64s)]
*  on them as an embarrassment. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=604.64s)]
*  Dark-skinned blacks faced discrimination and exclusion by lighter-skinned blacks. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=607.64s)]
*  There was also a general prejudice against rural Southerners, white or black, who were [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=612.64s)]
*  perceived to be rowdy, vulgar, ignorant, and more prone to violence and licentiousness. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=617.64s)]
*  Like the German Jews, these assimilated Northern blacks had managed to find some peace and [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=624.64s)]
*  even some acceptance in their cities, and they worried that they would be associated [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=630.64s)]
*  with the behavior of their country cousins. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=634.64s)]
*  So there were reasons for Jews to feel some sympathy for blacks, but tolerance has its [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=637.64s)]
*  limits when underclass groups start bumping against each other, and Jews who could afford [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=641.64s)]
*  it soon followed other Euro-ethnics out of the increasingly black inner cities. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=646.64s)]
*  When they left the neighborhood, some sold their shops and other businesses, or transferred [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=652.64s)]
*  their jobs near the suburbs, but many didn't, and a situation arose whereby real estate [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=657.64s)]
*  commerce and professional jobs in black neighborhoods were owned by Jews who had moved out. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=665.64s)]
*  This was bound to lead to conflict, and it did, such that by 1967 the black author, James [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=672.64s)]
*  Baldwin, fresh off receiving his Nobel Prize for Literature, could write in the New York [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=678.64s)]
*  Times Magazine, quote, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=684.64s)]
*  When we were growing up in Harlem, our demoralizing series of landlords were Jewish, and we hated [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=687.64s)]
*  them. This is how Baldwin begins his editorial. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=693.64s)]
*  We hated them because they were terrible landlords and did not take care of the building. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=698.64s)]
*  A coat of paint, a broken window, a stopped sink, a stopped toilet, a sagging floor, a [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=703.64s)]
*  broken ceiling, a dangerous stairwell. The question of garbage disposal, the question [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=709.64s)]
*  of heat and cold, of roaches and rats. All questions of life and death for the poor, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=715.64s)]
*  and especially those with children. We had to cope with all of these as best we could. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=721.64s)]
*  The grocer was a Jew, and being in debt to him was very much like being in debt to the [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=727.64s)]
*  company store. The butcher was a Jew, and yes, we certainly paid more for bad cuts of [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=732.64s)]
*  meat than other New York citizens, and we very often carried insults home along with [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=738.64s)]
*  the meat. We bought our clothes from a Jew, and sometimes our secondhand shoes, and the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=743.64s)]
*  pawnbroker was a Jew. Perhaps we hated him most of all. The merchants along 125th Street [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=749.64s)]
*  were Jewish, at least many of them were. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=756.64s)]
*  Of course, many Jews despise Negroes, just as their Arian brothers do. It is true that [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=760.64s)]
*  many Jews use, shamelessly, the slaughter of the six million by the Third Reich as proof [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=767.64s)]
*  that they cannot be bigots, or in the hope of not being held responsible for their bigotry. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=772.64s)]
*  It is galling to be told by a Jew whom you know to be exploiting you, that he cannot [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=778.64s)]
*  possibly be doing what you know he is doing because he is a Jew. It is bitter to watch [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=783.64s)]
*  the Jewish storekeeper locking up his store for the night and going home, going, with [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=789.64s)]
*  your money in his pocket, to a clean neighborhood miles from you which you will not be allowed [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=794.64s)]
*  to enter. Nor can it help the relationship between most Negroes and most Jews when part [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=800.64s)]
*  of this money is donated to civil rights. In the light of what is now known as the white [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=807.64s)]
*  backlash, this money can be looked on as conscience money merely, as money given to keep the Negro [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=812.64s)]
*  happy in his place and out of white neighborhoods. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=818.64s)]
*  Despite his humble upbringing, Baldwin's antipathy was that of a Black intellectual, having less [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=823.64s)]
*  to do with the day-to-day friction between an underclass group and the people just visible [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=830.64s)]
*  above them, and more to do with his offense at the idea that Jews would presume to usurp [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=835.64s)]
*  Black Americans' rightful claim to the title of America's chief victim. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=841.64s)]
*  One does not wish to be told by an American Jew that his suffering is as great as the [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=847.64s)]
*  American Negro's suffering. It isn't, and one knows that it isn't from the very tone [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=852.64s)]
*  in which he assures you that it is. The Jewish travail occurred across the sea, and America [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=857.64s)]
*  rescued him from the house of bondage. But America is the house of bondage for the Negro, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=863.64s)]
*  and no country can rescue him. What happens to the Negro here happens to him because he [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=869.64s)]
*  is an American. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=875.64s)]
*  Baldwin had titled his essay, Negroes are anti-Semitic because they're anti-white, but [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=879.64s)]
*  it was the first part of that statement that got people's attention. Shortly after the [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=885.64s)]
*  essay was published, the Times ran a response op-ed by Rabbi Robert Gordas entitled, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=890.64s)]
*  Negroes are anti-Semitic because they want a scapegoat. Mostly goes downhill from there. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=897.64s)]
*  This wasn't the first time simmering tension between Black and Jewish intellectuals appeared [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=904.64s)]
*  in print. A few years before Baldwin's Jeremiad was published, Norman Podhoretz gave the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=909.64s)]
*  Jewish perspective in a now-famous, or infamous, essay in the neoconservative journal [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=915.64s)]
*  Commentary called, My Negro Problem and Ours. Podhoretz attempts to excavate the roots of [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=921.64s)]
*  his own prejudice from his childhood experiences living in a mixed Brooklyn neighborhood with [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=929.64s)]
*  Italians, Blacks, and other Jews. His older sister was a left-wing political activist, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=934.64s)]
*  and he had heard more than once that Blacks were uniquely persecuted, but this seemed [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=941.64s)]
*  preposterous to the 12-year-old Podhoretz. A boy's world is quite small, and, quote, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=946.64s)]
*  In my world, it was the whites, the Italians and Jews who feared the Negroes, not the other [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=952.64s)]
*  way around. The Negroes were tougher than we were, more ruthless, and on the whole they [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=957.64s)]
*  were better athletes. What could it mean, then, to say that they were badly off and [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=963.64s)]
*  we were more fortunate? Yet my sister's opinions were sacred, and when she told me about exploitation [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=968.64s)]
*  and economic forces, I believed her. I believed her, but I was still afraid of Negroes, and [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=974.64s)]
*  I still hated them with all my heart. End quote. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=981.64s)]
*  The bulk of Podhoretz's essay is an itemization of grievances accumulated against Blacks from [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=987.64s)]
*  his boyhood, and partisans ever since have debated whether it should be considered a [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=993.64s)]
*  confessional or an apologia. His best friend, Carl, was Black, but one day Carl hit him [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=997.64s)]
*  on the way home and accused him of killing Jesus. Quote, When I ran home to my mother [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1004.64s)]
*  crying for an explanation, she told me not to pay attention to such foolishness, and [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1009.64s)]
*  then in Yiddish she cursed the goyim and the shvartsas, the shvartsas and the goyim. Carl, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1015.64s)]
*  it turned out, was a shvarta, and so was added a third to the categories into which people [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1021.64s)]
*  were mysteriously divided. End quote. Podhoretz recounts the time a new playground [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1027.6399999999999s)]
*  was built across the street from his house by the city of New York. The park even had [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1033.6399999999999s)]
*  a baseball diamond, and Podhoretz and his friends were ecstatic. For about a week. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1038.64s)]
*  Then, a gang of Black kids arrive and order them to stay away from the park. Quote, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1044.64s)]
*  This is the schoolyard manifestation of the feelings James Baldwin was expressing in his [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1068.64s)]
*  art. Quote, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1074.64s)]
*  This is the schoolyard manifestation of the feelings James Baldwin was expressing in his [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1078.64s)]
*  article. Not all Black kids would grow up to be a feat homosexual novelists like Baldwin, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1084.64s)]
*  and the ones in Podhoretz's story are of this more common type. Quote, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1090.64s)]
*  Baldwin wrote screeds for the New York Times because he couldn't bring himself to beat [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1108.64s)]
*  anyone up. Or maybe, Podhoretz's schoolmates beat him up because they couldn't write essays [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1114.64s)]
*  for the Times. In another example, Podhoretz tells of the time he had the temerity to answer [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1120.64s)]
*  a teacher's question after a Black boy named Quentin had gotten it wrong. Quote, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9V5EuoD3U&t=1127.64s)]
