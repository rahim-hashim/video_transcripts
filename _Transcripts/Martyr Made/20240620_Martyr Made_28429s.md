Huge thanks to the folks behind the Alternative Considerations of Jonestown Project. This podcast wouldn't have been possible without their indispensable hard work recording, organizing, and transcribing the Peoples Temple tapes and other source materials. For further information about Jonestown, you can't do better than their website. I did my best to tell the story here as I understand it, but if you ask me the work they're doing will lead to a fundamental future reassessment of what happened.

# #17 – God’s Socialist, pt. 7: A Gallant, Glorious, Screaming End

*  Temple, better known as the Jonestown Suicide Cult. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11.040000000000001s)]

*  Here we go. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=70.62s)]
*  I'm content to die for my beliefs. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=71.62s)]
*  So cut off my head. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=76.62s)]
*  And make me a martyr. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=82.14s)]
*  The people will always remember it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=85.1s)]
*  No. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=89.1s)]
*  They will forget. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=91.1s)]
*  A while back, I came across this series of articles from the New York Times that they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=111.66s)]
*  published in January of 1973, which due to events here in 2020, not only in New York [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=133.1s)]
*  City, but around the country, I've had occasion to send out to friends more than once recently. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  The series was about the South Bronx as it was found by these New York Times investigative [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=149.26s)]
*  reporters at the time of publication. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=155.62s)]
*  Again we're talking January of 73. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=158.66s)]
*  The headline of the first of the four articles, which ran below the fold on the front page [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=163.14000000000001s)]
*  on consecutive days in the middle of that month, read, South Bronx, a jungle stalked [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=168.1s)]
*  by fear, seized by rage. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=175.46s)]
*  It was accompanied by a large picture of a South Bronx resident filling up a bucket at [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=179.26s)]
*  an open fire hydrant with the caption, the fire hydrants are open. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=188.26s)]
*  Even in this biting cold weather, town pumps that provide the sole water supply for drinking, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=193.01999999999998s)]
*  washing and sanitation for thousands of tenants in 20% of the housing in the area. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=199.34s)]
*  When one hydrant freezes over, the residents pry open another. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=206.06s)]
*  The writers did not have to travel far for this story. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=212.62s)]
*  It's only about eight miles from the rarefied air of the New York Times building to the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=216.9s)]
*  South Bronx. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=222.74s)]
*  It's 12 miles from Wall Street up north to the South Bronx. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=224.74s)]
*  It's just south of Yankee Stadium. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=228.78s)]
*  And yet traveling those few miles north and across the Harlem River to investigate this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=232.14s)]
*  area of about 400,000 residents, mostly black and Puerto Rican, by 73 I think it was pretty [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=239.7s)]
*  much all black and Puerto Rican. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  These reporters might have felt like foreign correspondents reporting from a third world [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=247.38s)]
*  country. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=251.58s)]
*  Of those 400,000 residents, 40% were on welfare. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  The unemployment rate was 30%. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=259.18s)]
*  And you really have to have lived in a place like that to understand what that's like. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=263.02s)]
*  It's not just that people don't have enough money. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=270.5s)]
*  Things change in a community when one out of every three able-bodied working age people [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=273.86s)]
*  have nothing to do and no income coming in. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=280.06s)]
*  Especially in a slum like the South Bronx where no one was expecting that to be a temporary [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=283.06s)]
*  situation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=289.5s)]
*  As the caption accompanying that picture in the Times mentioned, 20% of all residences [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=292.5s)]
*  in this area of 400,000 people had no running water. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=300.58s)]
*  You really have to take that in. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=304.82s)]
*  Don't let a statistic like that kind of hit you and be shocking, but just slide past without [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=305.97999999999996s)]
*  thinking about what that means and putting it in context. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=312.78s)]
*  One out of every five homes and apartments in an area containing 400,000 people had no [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=316.14s)]
*  running water. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=321.02s)]
*  Not way up in the mountains somewhere where infrastructure just hadn't quite been built [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=322.85999999999996s)]
*  out. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  They all had running water a decade before these articles were written. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=329.54s)]
*  We're talking about New York City, a dozen miles north of Wall Street in a neighborhood [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  that the bankers passed through on their way to a Yankees game. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=339.42s)]
*  50% of all residences had no heat at least half the time. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=343.74s)]
*  And again, this is in New York City and this article was written in January. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=349.38s)]
*  It's so cold that the fire hydrants are freezing over. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=353.38s)]
*  50% of the homes have no heat. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=357.18s)]
*  This is from the article, quote, the number of public health nurses who visit schools [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=359.18s)]
*  and homes has been cut in half in the last five years and health programs have been curtailed [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=365.7s)]
*  or eliminated. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=370.7s)]
*  Fewer policemen patrol the streets and reductions correspond with a matching rise in violent [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=372.58000000000004s)]
*  crime. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=377.38s)]
*  Fewer firemen respond to fires. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=378.7s)]
*  When they do, they are sometimes ambushed and pelted with debris. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=380.94s)]
*  Last fall, youth started a rubbish fire at East 163rd and Kelly streets and blocked off [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=386.3s)]
*  traffic. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=391.5s)]
*  It was an out and out ambush, Lieutenant Riley says. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=392.5s)]
*  They came out of the doors, the side streets, carrying chains and knives and throwing bricks. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=395.5s)]
*  They broke the windshields on the engine and the truck. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=400.5s)]
*  One fireman was hit in the face. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=403.5s)]
*  Fewer welfare workers provide services, resulting in predawn lines at welfare centers. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=406.5s)]
*  Fewer housing inspectors enforce the housing code, although 60,000 of the 80,000 units [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=411.5s)]
*  are substandard, dilapidated and in violation of the city code. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=417.66s)]
*  Of the 20,000 decent housing units, virtually all are public housing, end quote. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=422.7s)]
*  The ruination of the South Bronx, as I mentioned, was a pretty recent phenomenon at the time. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=430.66s)]
*  Until the 1950s, it was a middle class borough, mostly lived in by Jews and some Greeks and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=438.34s)]
*  Italians and some other European Catholic ethnics. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=444.7s)]
*  Just a dozen years prior, in 1961, the South Bronx was still 40% white and the schools [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=447.94s)]
*  and infrastructure and public services were decent. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=455.62s)]
*  It was a working class borough, had an edge to it, but it was a livable area for families. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=460.41999999999996s)]
*  The Times article in 1973 says that by then, you couldn't find a white person among the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=468.22s)]
*  400,000 South Bronx residents. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=474.70000000000005s)]
*  In 12 years, you went from almost half the population being white to all of them being [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=477.18s)]
*  gone virtually. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=484.06s)]
*  They fled as African Americans and Puerto Ricans had moved in. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=485.58000000000004s)]
*  It was just a classic case of white flight. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=489.62s)]
*  Property values crashed. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=494.06s)]
*  Landlords couldn't find buyers. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=496.18s)]
*  They couldn't find renters a lot of the time. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=497.5s)]
*  Many of them just opted to strip the piping and electrical wiring and anything else that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=500.34s)]
*  could be salvaged for value from the buildings and either just abandon the properties or [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=503.94s)]
*  burn them down for the insurance money. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=508.06s)]
*  Since no one was around to buy the ruined properties, they would just stay that way. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=510.38s)]
*  By the end of the 1970s, this is so crazy, by the end of the 70s, more than 40% of all [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=515.82s)]
*  the buildings in the South Bronx had been burned. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=522.58s)]
*  People remember there being a constant smoky haze over the borough throughout the decade [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=526.96s)]
*  because buildings were burning there every night for years. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=531.4000000000001s)]
*  There's a famous apocryphal story from the 77 World Series where there was an aerial [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  shot over Yankee Stadium that showed fires burning uncontrollably all around it while [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=539.96s)]
*  the series is going on. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=544.72s)]
*  The announcer, Howard Cassell, was supposed to have said, there it is, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=546.72s)]
*  the Bronx is burning. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=550.84s)]
*  Apparently, it is an apocryphal story. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=552.44s)]
*  He didn't actually say that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=554.88s)]
*  It got picked up and people believed that he said it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=557.24s)]
*  It became a thing. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=559.5600000000001s)]
*  The Bronx is burning. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=561.12s)]
*  It became a thing for a reason. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=562.12s)]
*  It corresponded to something that was going on. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=563.72s)]
*  There was a single hospital servicing the entire borough. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=566.6s)]
*  I guess the Bronx is the borough. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=572.24s)]
*  South Bronx is just part of it, but still a single hospital, a broken down notorious [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=573.64s)]
*  butcher shop. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=578.32s)]
*  That was what the residents called it, a butcher shop that we'll discuss a little later for [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=579.32s)]
*  400,000 people. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=583.12s)]
*  Residents of, you name it, infant mortality, venereal disease, tuberculosis, malnutrition, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=586.08s)]
*  not only the worst in the city, I mean, they're developing world levels. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=592.1600000000001s)]

*  You know, they're asking you, a writer comes up and says, hey, I'm from the New York Times [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=735.76s)]
*  and we're trying to bring some attention to the conditions of the South Bronx, you know, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=740.76s)]

*  What's it like to live up here? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=746.64s)]
*  And so the residents got to try to explain to them what it's like to live in a place [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=748.92s)]
*  like this. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=754.7199999999999s)]

*  them to understand? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=761.42s)]
*  Because there's really no way you can. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=763.68s)]
*  And so you seize on maybe anecdotes that will resonate. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=766.64s)]
*  You tell them about the mice running through the cupboards or some crime you witnessed [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=770.36s)]

*  things had gotten so bad so quickly. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=990.2s)]

*  This passage from Rick Perlstein's book, Mix and Land, describes very well how people envision [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1044.92s)]
*  the immediate future. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1052.76s)]

*  Quote, Lyndon Johnson spent the first year of his accidental presidency passing with [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1059.92s)]
*  breathtaking aplomb, a liberal legislative agenda that had only known existence as wish [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1065.8s)]
*  during John F. Kennedy's lifetime. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1070.48s)]
*  His Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, the war on poverty, passed nearly two to one. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1073.2s)]

*  the Kennedy-Johnson tax cut, but Lyndon Johnson passed that too. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1083.92s)]
*  And then there was the issue of civil rights. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1088.3600000000001s)]
*  Let this session of Congress be known as the session that did more for civil rights than [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1091.32s)]

*  It was just five weeks after John F. Kennedy's assassination. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1101.52s)]
*  Seven months after Kennedy, alarmed by a wave of civil rights uprising sparked in Birmingham, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1105.1200000000001s)]
*  Alabama, had introduced the most sweeping civil rights bill since Reconstruction. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1110.76s)]
*  It had been bogged down by Congress's recalcitrant conservative coalition of northern Republicans [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1115.88s)]
*  and southern Democrats. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1120.46s)]
*  Even Martin Luther King's heroic hundreds of thousands of pilgrims marching on Washington [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1122.38s)]

*  But President Johnson unstuck it. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1128.22s)]
*  By June of 1964, the first session of the 88th Congress had indeed done more than the [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1130.8600000000001s)]
*  last 100 sessions combined. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1136.7s)]

*  The principles of our freedom forbid it. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1149.14s)]
*  Morality forbids it. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1151.7s)]
*  And the law I sign tonight forbids it, Johnson said at a ceremony carried live on all three [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1153.6200000000001s)]
*  networks. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1159.7s)]
*  What the ceremony marked was not merely a law, but a liberal apotheosis, an apparent [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1161.38s)]

*  So even did conservative businessmen. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1180.04s)]
*  Speaking before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the president was interrupted for applause [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1183.0s)]
*  some 60 times. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1186.84s)]
*  They had reason to cheer. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1188.8s)]
*  So dynamic had the American economic engine become that it was fashionable to presume [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1190.68s)]
*  that prosperity could fix any social problem. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1194.84s)]
*  I'm sick of all these people who talk about the things we can't do, Lyndon Johnson told [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1197.76s)]
*  an aide in one of his patented exhortations. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1203.08s)]
*  Hell, we're the richest country in the world, the most powerful. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1205.52s)]
*  We can do it all. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1209.36s)]
*  The great society was the name Johnson gave his ambition. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1211.4799999999998s)]
*  It rests on abundance and liberty for all, he said in a May 22nd speech. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1215.6799999999998s)]
*  A society of success without squalor, beauty without barrenness, works of genius without [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1220.8799999999999s)]
*  the wretchedness of poverty. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1227.28s)]
*  The rhetoric was incredible. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1230.08s)]
*  Still more incredible, it seemed reasonable. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1232.28s)]
*  Lyndon Johnson successfully framed his reformist agenda as something that was not ideological [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1235.4s)]
*  at all, conservative even. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1240.16s)]
*  Simply a pragmatic response to pressing national problems swept forward on ineluctable tides [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1243.16s)]

*  In his January 4th, 1965 State of the Union address, he said, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1266.32s)]
*  We have achieved a unity of interest among our people that is unmatched in the history [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1270.8s)]
*  of freedom. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1275.1599999999999s)]
*  He continued, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1277.12s)]
*  I propose that we begin a massive attack on crippling and killing diseases. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1278.36s)]
*  I propose that we launch a national effort to make the American city a better and more [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1283.44s)]
*  stimulating place to live. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1288.28s)]
*  I propose that we increase the beauty of America and end the poisoning of our rivers and the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1290.72s)]
*  air that we breathe. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1295.5200000000002s)]
*  I propose that we eliminate every remaining obstacle to the right and the opportunity [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1297.4s)]
*  to vote. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1301.88s)]

*  The liberals' struggle to pass federal funding for education had been a political dry hole [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1310.3200000000002s)]
*  since the New Deal. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1314.2800000000002s)]

*  He then insisted the Senate pass the same bill without a single word changed. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1321.48s)]
*  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act passed the Senate two weeks later with only [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1326.12s)]

*  Heart disease, cancer and stroke can be conquered, not in a millennium, not in a century, but [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1336.32s)]

*  The down payment on the revolution was medical insurance for the elderly, funded out of social [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1345.68s)]
*  security contributions. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1350.02s)]
*  Another stalled New Deal-era initiative steered by Johnson passed its permanent obstacle, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1352.1200000000001s)]
*  the American Medical Association. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1356.6000000000001s)]
*  And then there was civil rights. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1359.28s)]
*  The genesis of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 echoed the genesis of the Civil Rights Act [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1361.3600000000001s)]
*  in 1964. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1366.92s)]
*  Following the march by Martin Luther King, freshly minted Nobel Peace Prize Laureate [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1369.28s)]
*  from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, President Johnson prepared to give the greatest speech [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1373.4799999999998s)]
*  of his career. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1378.08s)]
*  Outside the White House, left-wing picketers marched by with signs reading, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1379.8799999999999s)]
*  LBJ, just you wait, see what happens in 68. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1384.1599999999999s)]
*  The threat, redeem the martyrs of Selma or be punished at the polls, seemed viable. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1388.6s)]
*  Answering that yearning appeared now not just a moral imperative, but a political one. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1394.12s)]
*  That no one was prepared for the moral force of the speech Lyndon Johnson gave to Congress [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1399.24s)]
*  and the nation on March 15th. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1404.28s)]
*  He wrote it himself and delivered it over the objections of temporizing aides. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1406.88s)]
*  It is wrong, deadly wrong, to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote in [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1412.04s)]
*  this country. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1417.84s)]
*  There is no issue of states' rights or national rights. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1419.48s)]
*  There is only the struggle for human rights. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1422.56s)]
*  Their cause must be our cause. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1425.88s)]
*  Because it is not just Negroes, really it is all of us who must overcome the crippling [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1429.16s)]
*  legacy of bigotry and injustice. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1434.0800000000002s)]
*  Then stunningly, he raised his arms in the air and invoked the slogan of a movement that [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1437.92s)]
*  was not too long ago perceived as the preeminent irritant to America's national unity. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1442.92s)]
*  And we shall overcome. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1449.0800000000002s)]
*  There followed the silence of a reaction too stunned for mere applause. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1453.08s)]
*  Martin Luther King cried. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1458.1599999999999s)]
*  Senators cried. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1460.1999999999998s)]
*  The next Selma procession on March 21st was celebratory. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1462.1599999999999s)]
*  Thousands of singing marchers, ranks of glamorous celebrities on the floor marching all the [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1466.0s)]
*  way through to Montgomery. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1470.3999999999999s)]
*  That night, one of the marchers, a Detroit mother of five named Viola Liuzzo, while humming [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1472.72s)]
*  we shall overcome in her car was shot to death by the Ku Klux Klan because she was sitting [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1477.84s)]
*  next to a black man. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1482.0s)]
*  The martyr only seemed to intensify the nation's moral resolve. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1483.8s)]
*  Should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars and still [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1488.4s)]
*  be unequal to this issue, Lyndon Johnson had proclaimed, then we will have failed as a [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1493.4s)]
*  people and as a nation. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1499.32s)]
*  He signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on August 6th under the Capitol Dome. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1502.7s)]
*  He intoned about the slaves who came in darkness and they came in chains. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1508.6s)]
*  Today we strike away the last major shackle of those fierce and ancient bonds. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1513.4399999999998s)]
*  People cried. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1519.08s)]
*  The Negro's cause was America's cause. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1520.36s)]
*  Who could argue with that? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1523.6399999999999s)]
*  End quote. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1526.0s)]
*  Well this story, the story of this podcast series has told part of the narrative of how [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1529.4399999999998s)]
*  the rest of the decade went. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1535.88s)]
*  Just five nights after Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, following a DUI [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1539.2800000000002s)]

*  into the worst urban violence since the draft riots of the Civil War. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1553.2800000000002s)]
*  Reporters couldn't go deep into the conflict zone without being attacked, but a helicopter [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1559.5600000000002s)]
*  was there streaming live footage of the racial violence into people's homes for the next [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1563.88s)]
*  five days and nights nonstop. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1569.16s)]
*  People watched crowds of civilians setting buildings on fire and dancing around them [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1573.8400000000001s)]
*  and then attacking and chasing away the firefighters who tried to put out the flames. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1579.64s)]
*  Some rioters were giving interviews promising that the violence was going to spread, it [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1585.68s)]
*  was going to go out into the suburbs and that white residents were going to be pulled from [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1590.0800000000002s)]
*  their homes and dealt with and it was probably, you know, half a percent of the people who [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1593.12s)]
*  were saying things like that, but of course the reporters found those people and put them [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1600.36s)]
*  on TV. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1603.8799999999999s)]
*  More than once people were watching the news, seeing a live stream from the helicopter, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1606.76s)]
*  live feed from the helicopter when it was forced to flee the scene because it was taking [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1611.2399999999998s)]
*  small arms fire from the ground. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1614.76s)]
*  There had been plenty of racial violence before this in the 1960s, including a riot in Harlem [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1619.24s)]
*  the year before, but nobody was prepared for the scale and the aggression, the rage that [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1623.96s)]
*  they saw on display in Watts and the day and night sensationalized live coverage of the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1631.36s)]
*  whole thing. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1637.56s)]
*  It was incredibly shocking to people who until then had liked to think of this kind of thing [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1638.56s)]
*  as a southern problem. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1645.0s)]
*  They thought of the whole civil rights issue as a southern problem, it was something that [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1647.6s)]
*  the rest of the country had to impose on the south to get them to kind of catch up with [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1650.9199999999998s)]
*  the times and there was some violence down there, racial violence as the south resisted [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1654.4399999999998s)]
*  it and so forth, but they almost thought of civil rights as a little bit of a stretch, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1658.6399999999999s)]
*  but not much, almost as a foreign policy problem. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1664.4399999999998s)]
*  Well Watts showed them that was not the case. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1669.36s)]
*  Eventually the city was pacified with the help of the National Guard and when it was [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1674.08s)]
*  over dozens of people were dead and we've talked about it in a previous episode, over [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1677.6s)]
*  a thousand people were injured, 3500 people had been arrested and although it wasn't obvious [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1681.8s)]
*  to everyone at the time, one of the things that had been reduced to a smoldering crater [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1687.76s)]
*  that week in Los Angeles was LBJ's Great Society. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1692.56s)]
*  The following year, 1966, Ronald Reagan became governor of California basically on a single [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1697.88s)]
*  issue platform promising to fight what he saw as a threat to civilization posed by this [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1704.64s)]
*  budding black power movement and its white liberal enablers. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1710.4s)]
*  The next year, 1967, the Black Panthers take to the streets and the year after that, 1968, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1715.42s)]
*  sees the most widespread and radical protests in the country's history. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1720.5600000000002s)]
*  Martin Luther King is assassinated and cities across America just burn. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1725.72s)]
*  By 1968, and again just compare this to the passage I was just reading, the attitude and [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1731.36s)]
*  the rhetoric of the passage I was reading, that was in 64 and 65, by 68, Lyndon Johnson [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1737.28s)]
*  is so boxed in by law and order Republicans and the radical insurgents in his own Democratic [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1743.3999999999999s)]
*  party that just four years after that historic victory, one of the biggest landslides in [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1747.96s)]
*  American history, he withdrew from the race rather than seek reelection and have to defend [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1752.6599999999999s)]
*  his record. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1759.6599999999999s)]
*  His withdrawal from the presidential race in 68 brought about an unexpected primary [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1762.3s)]
*  election for the incumbent party, the Democrats, to see who was going to face Richard Nixon [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1766.1399999999999s)]
*  in the general election. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1771.58s)]
*  And all the energy on the liberal left was with the youth movement in 68. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1773.2199999999998s)]
*  And after Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June, just after winning the California primary, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1778.62s)]
*  that energy consolidated behind Eugene McCarthy, who was a senator, not a radical by any stretch [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1784.5s)]
*  of the imagination, but he was anti-war. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1789.5s)]
*  He was against the war in Vietnam at least. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1791.5s)]
*  His opponent, the opponent that emerged for him, Hubert Humphrey, he was seen accurately [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1795.58s)]
*  as representing the same positions that had forced LBJ from the race in the first place, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1802.1s)]
*  especially on the Vietnam War. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1806.22s)]
*  McCarthy, the anti-war candidate, dominated the popular vote in the primary elections. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1808.9s)]
*  The second and third place finishers were LBJ and Bobby Kennedy, who weren't even in [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1813.98s)]
*  the race anymore. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1817.7s)]
*  But the party bosses used something called the favorite son strategy, where they arranged [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1820.06s)]
*  for several state politicians to put themselves on the ballot in their home states, win their [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1825.7s)]
*  home primaries, and then use their delegates to support Humphrey. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1831.82s)]
*  None of these guys were actually even running for president. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1836.3799999999999s)]
*  They were only on the ballot in their home states, where they were very popular and could [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1839.34s)]
*  count on the local support. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1842.74s)]
*  And they pulled this off in a bunch of major states, like Ohio, California, Florida, and [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1844.6599999999999s)]
*  the Democratic Party establishment was able to drag Humphrey to the nomination despite [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1849.62s)]
*  the fact he didn't win a single primary. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1854.1799999999998s)]
*  He only got 2% of the total primary votes compared to McCarthy's almost 40%. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1856.46s)]
*  The DNC convention in Chicago that year, it was in Chicago that year, and the young people [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1863.5s)]
*  showed up to protest and some of them were rowdy, some of them were more than rowdy, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1869.42s)]
*  and Chicago's Mayor Daley let his dogs off the leash and the whole thing turned into [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1873.78s)]
*  a massive riot. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1877.32s)]
*  And Richard Nixon, the ultimate law and order Republican, was elected president promising [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1879.78s)]
*  to bring the hammer down on these people who were causing all this chaos. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1885.32s)]
*  That's how rapidly things had changed. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1891.16s)]
*  And the way that the Democratic primary and convention went down, it totally discredited [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1894.64s)]
*  the liberal establishment of the Democratic Party among the party's left wing. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1900.2s)]
*  If the moderating voices who were urging these radicals to work within the system and trust [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1905.96s)]
*  the process, if they had any influence before, they lost it after the 68 election. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1910.92s)]
*  You've got to remember, this is the height of the Vietnam War. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1915.5200000000002s)]
*  Guys are being drafted in droves and sent over there. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1918.72s)]
*  If you pick up the papers, it does not seem to be going well. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1922.0800000000002s)]
*  People are getting killed and wounded in huge numbers, and the war is so unpopular that [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1925.7600000000002s)]
*  the incumbent president decides to step down rather than defend it and run for re-election. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1930.96s)]
*  So in the primary, there's a legitimate anti-war candidate, so the people get behind him and [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1937.12s)]
*  he cleans up. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1942.68s)]
*  He dominates the primaries, but the party establishment says, nope, sorry, we're going [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1943.68s)]
*  with a guy who's going to keep drafting you, keep sending you to Vietnam. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1948.04s)]
*  Doesn't matter that he didn't win a single primary. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1952.0s)]
*  Doesn't matter that only 2% of you voted for him. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1954.78s)]
*  Too bad, so sad. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1957.04s)]
*  By the way, don't dodge the draft or we will throw you in prison. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1958.32s)]
*  And when you protest at the party convention, we're going to turn the cops loose to straight [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1962.12s)]
*  up attack and savagely beat you in the streets. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1966.04s)]
*  You can understand where the radicals were coming from when they concluded, you know, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1969.84s)]
*  okay, oh, I see now that we are playing a totally different game. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1974.44s)]
*  I don't know what this game is called, but it's not democracy. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1978.72s)]
*  And so people who are telling me that I have to keep playing by the rules of democracy, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1982.58s)]
*  those people are just gaslighting me because that's not what this is anymore. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1986.8799999999999s)]
*  It's very easy to understand why 1968 radicalized both the anti-war movement and the movement [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1991.04s)]
*  for black civil rights. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=1998.2s)]
*  The assassination of Martin Luther King in the spring of that year and then the way the [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2000.72s)]
*  democratic primary went down. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2004.96s)]
*  And remember that included the assassination of Bobby Kennedy. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2007.2s)]
*  After those two events, the people in the anti-war and civil rights movements, especially [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2010.86s)]
*  the young people said, look, okay, we try to do it your way. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2016.4s)]
*  Martin Luther King was the ultimate version of trying to do it your way. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2021.44s)]
*  He spoke out against black power. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2025.52s)]
*  He insisted that people stick to nonviolence and trust the process. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2027.88s)]
*  And they shot him. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2031.96s)]
*  College students who were supporting Eugene McCarthy, they were shaving their beards and [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2034.88s)]
*  cutting off their long hair. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2039.8400000000001s)]
*  They called it the Clean for Gene campaign. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2041.92s)]
*  And so they were really trying to do it the right way. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2044.72s)]
*  They really were trying. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2048.2s)]
*  And the response they got was violence. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2050.96s)]
*  Two months after the election, the Panther 21 were arrested in New York for plotting [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2055.2799999999997s)]
*  a mass assassination of NYPD officers. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2059.44s)]
*  Few months after that, the weathermen took over SDS. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2063.08s)]
*  Those calling for reform, they just no longer had any ground to stand on against people [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2067.88s)]
*  calling for rebellion. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2073.1s)]
*  What could you say to a black power militant when you call for nonviolence and working [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2075.22s)]
*  within the democratic process and he says, oh, you mean like Dr. King did, right? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2079.98s)]
*  What do you say to a radical at an anti-war rally when you both agree, because everybody [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2085.1s)]
*  did, that the primary election was straight up stolen so that the people wouldn't even [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2091.02s)]
*  be allowed to vote in 1968 on whether or not they wanted to stay in Vietnam? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2096.3399999999997s)]
*  And that was not an abstract issue. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2102.3s)]
*  I mean, this was an issue of like, you got a good chance of being pulled off the street [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2103.98s)]
*  and sent over to this war. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2110.1800000000003s)]
*  And so the move toward radicalism was understandable, but once it took root, a process began that [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2112.5s)]
*  was self-reinforcing and began to spiral out of control. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2123.5s)]
*  Because again, no one knew how to stand up to the radicals anymore. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2129.92s)]
*  Is the most radical person today wouldn't be the most radical person tomorrow. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2135.2000000000003s)]
*  Today's extreme view became tomorrow's consensus and the next day another person would appear [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2139.36s)]
*  to take things to the next level and nobody knew how. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2144.16s)]
*  Nobody had the logical or moral language to say, okay, okay, that's a little too far. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2146.88s)]
*  Maybe we should slow it down. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2151.44s)]
*  The framework just didn't exist to put the brakes on it. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2154.28s)]
*  That's the thing about rebellion. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2158.2400000000002s)]
*  Once a rebellion is initiated, it can take on a life of its own. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2159.88s)]
*  And this is why so often revolutions end up turning into something that its original idealist [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2164.44s)]
*  never imagined or intended. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2169.6000000000004s)]
*  The French Revolution, Russian Revolution, all the way up to the protest movements of [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2172.1600000000003s)]
*  the 60s. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2176.5600000000004s)]
*  You see it time and again, whenever movements move on from making specific demands to a [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2177.5600000000004s)]
*  rejection of the system as a whole. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2185.3999999999996s)]
*  In the American context of the 1960s, of course, the situation was complicated even more by [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2189.68s)]
*  race and the way class was intertwined with race and the white and black sections of the [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2194.12s)]
*  protest movement began to interact in ways and feed into each other's worst impulses [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2200.08s)]
*  in ways that eventually became very destructive for both movements, for both groups, although [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2205.7999999999997s)]
*  more for the blacks than for the whites. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2211.2s)]
*  Because in the African-American side of the movement, you have an identifiable group of [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2215.48s)]
*  people with a shared history of oppression that oppression had manifested into a degraded [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2220.88s)]
*  present condition. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2228.08s)]
*  And whatever accessories their movement later acquired when people started reading Mao and [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2229.08s)]
*  incorporating other elements, the movement was always basically political. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2234.6s)]
*  The goal was a rebalancing of the racial power structure in America and an improvement in [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2240.2s)]
*  the material conditions for these people. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2245.2799999999997s)]
*  In other words, politics. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2248.52s)]
*  Politics is about power, how it's distributed and used by people and on people in a society. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2250.3999999999996s)]
*  The white protest movement was always coming from a somewhat different place. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2258.2s)]
*  The base of that movement was white university students. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2262.7599999999998s)]
*  In other words, people who were already part of America's ruling cast, taken in a broad sense. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2265.8s)]
*  The root of their protest was not political but cultural. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2273.0s)]
*  They were rebelling very often against what they saw as the stifling conformity of the [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2277.7200000000003s)]
*  post-war society that their parents had built. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2283.8s)]
*  And over time, they began to valorize rebellion against the system in whatever form they found it. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2286.84s)]
*  Over the course of the 1960s, the white protest movement grew to fetishize black people as [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2292.44s)]
*  born revolutionaries. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2298.16s)]
*  It was a tendency that you can identify at least as early as Sartre's preface to the [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2300.16s)]
*  61 edition of Frantz Fanon's book, The Wretched of the Earth. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2306.04s)]
*  Fanon was a black man. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2309.4s)]
*  Frantz Fanon was a black man, a descendant of slaves born in a French Caribbean colony. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2311.4s)]
*  And so this book, The Wretched of the Earth, is written by Frantz Fanon. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2316.92s)]
*  The Wretched of the Earth is written by a colonized person to other colonized people. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2321.0s)]
*  And provides a call and a rough blueprint of a strategy for the colonized to find their [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2325.72s)]
*  own voice and begin to create their own world. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2331.72s)]
*  And part of that blueprint involved the legitimization of violence by the colonized against the colonizers. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2333.8s)]
*  But if you only read Sartre's preface, you'd be forgiven for thinking that violence was [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2341.4s)]
*  all the book was about. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2347.56s)]
*  Other than just the only thing about the book that really excited white radicals at [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2349.84s)]
*  the time. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2353.84s)]
*  As the protest movements developed and coalesced, getting into the 1960s, the books that were [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2356.52s)]
*  being passed around and devoured by the white radicals were not sober calls for recognition [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2362.0s)]
*  of black dignity. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2367.76s)]
*  They weren't passing around copies of Dr. King's letters from jail. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2370.04s)]
*  violent men like Eldridge Cleaver, monsters like George Jackson. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2374.04s)]
*  When Leonard Bernstein threw his radical chic party, he wanted black panthers at his penthouse, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2380.24s)]
*  not a black preacher. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2385.2799999999997s)]
*  Many of the white radicals very often, this is something that people like Malcolm would [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2388.6s)]
*  complain about a lot, the white radicals would very often tend to indulge in many of the [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2392.96s)]
*  same racial stereotypes that the white racists did. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2397.8s)]
*  They thought of black people as untamable creatures who were prone to outbursts of violence [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2402.16s)]
*  and possessed of uncontrollable sexual impulses, except they fetishized these stereotypes. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2407.7599999999998s)]
*  They thought that they represented the blacks' lack of repression and closeness to nature [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2413.6s)]
*  rather than fearing or hating these projections, which is what the white racists did. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2419.3999999999996s)]
*  They indulged many of the same ideas. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2424.72s)]
*  Many black writers from Malcolm to Cleaver to James Baldwin spoke on this tendency of [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2428.68s)]
*  many whites to project their own repressed desire to act out onto black people and encourage [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2434.2799999999997s)]
*  the black other to break boundaries that they themselves would never break for fear of the [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2442.2799999999997s)]
*  consequences so that they could live out the transgression vicariously. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2446.7599999999998s)]
*  There's a famous 1963 article in Commentary Magazine, a neoconservative magazine, by neoconservative [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2453.16s)]
*  writer Norman Podhoretz who described this tendency but from the opposite, from a reactionary [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2460.3199999999997s)]
*  perspective. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2466.7999999999997s)]
*  He wrote, quote, the psychologists tell us that the white man hates the negro because [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2468.92s)]
*  he tends to project those wild impulses that he fears in himself onto an alien group which [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2474.08s)]
*  he then punishes with his contempt. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2479.62s)]
*  There is no question that they are right about that. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2482.52s)]
*  For me, as a child, the life lived on the other side of the playground and down the [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2485.28s)]
*  block on Ralph Avenue seemed the very embodiment of the values of the street. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2488.88s)]
*  Free, independent, reckless, brave, masculine, erotic. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2493.48s)]
*  I put the word erotic last, though it is usually stressed above all others, because in fact [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2498.84s)]
*  it came last, in consciousness as in importance. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2503.6s)]
*  What mainly counted for me about the negro kids of my own age was that they were bad [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2506.96s)]
*  boys. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2511.04s)]
*  There were plenty of bad boys among the whites. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2512.04s)]
*  This was, after all, a neighborhood with a long tradition of crime as a career path open [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2514.48s)]
*  to aspiring talents. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2518.66s)]
*  But the negroes were really bad. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2520.64s)]
*  Bad in a way that beckoned a one and made one feel inadequate. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2522.88s)]
*  We all went home every day for a lunch of spinach and potatoes. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2527.06s)]
*  They roamed around during lunch hour munching on candy bars. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2531.2400000000002s)]
*  In winter, we had to wear itchy woolen hats and mittens and cumbersome galoshes. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2535.4s)]
*  They were bareheaded and loose as they pleased. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2540.32s)]
*  We rarely played hooky or got into serious trouble at school for all our street corner [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2543.76s)]
*  bravado. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2548.1200000000003s)]
*  They were defiant. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2549.42s)]
*  Forever staying out to do what delicious things. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2551.4s)]
*  Forever making disturbances in class and in the halls. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2554.96s)]
*  Forever being sent to the principal and returning uncowed. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2558.04s)]
*  But most important of all, they were tough. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2561.48s)]
*  Beautifully, enviably tough. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2564.4s)]
*  Not giving a damn for anyone or anything. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2567.16s)]
*  To hell with the teacher, the truant officer, the cop. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2570.04s)]
*  To hell with the whole of the adult world that held us in its grip and that we never [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2573.16s)]
*  had the courage to rebel against except sporadically and in petty ways." [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2577.2s)]
*  End quote. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2581.92s)]
*  And you can go back even before, 61, before Sartre and Fanon, where you had guys like [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2582.92s)]
*  Norman Mailer, the beat writer and one of major leaders of the counterculture. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2590.12s)]
*  In 57 or 58, he'd written a famous, infamous, I guess I don't know today, maybe you'd call [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2596.12s)]
*  it essay, in which he describes this new emerging human type, the hipster. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2601.16s)]
*  Very different from what we mean by the term today. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2608.16s)]
*  The essay is called The White Negro. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2611.4s)]
*  And it holds up every black stereotype and caricature that you can imagine as an imitative [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2614.36s)]
*  ideal for a liberated white person, which he compares in the essay favorably with the [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2622.76s)]
*  psychopathic personality. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2627.48s)]
*  And for definition of a psychopathic personality, he draws on a book called Rebel Without a [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2630.1200000000003s)]
*  Cause by an author named Robert Linder. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2634.8s)]
*  Quote, the psychopath is a rebel without a cause, an agitator without a slogan, a revolutionary [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2637.48s)]
*  without a program. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2644.12s)]
*  In other words, his rebelliousness is aimed to achieve goals satisfactory to himself alone. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2645.7999999999997s)]
*  He is incapable of exertions for the sake of others. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2651.88s)]
*  All his efforts, hidden under no matter what disguise, represent investments designed to [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2655.3199999999997s)]
*  satisfy his immediate wishes and desires. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2660.04s)]
*  The psychopath, like the child, cannot delay the pleasures of gratification. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2663.48s)]
*  And this trait is one of his underlying universal characteristics. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2668.68s)]
*  He cannot wait upon erotic gratification, which convention demands should be preceded [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2672.96s)]
*  by the chase before the kill. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2677.16s)]
*  He must rape. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2679.04s)]
*  He cannot wait upon the development of prestige in society. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2680.44s)]
*  His egoistic ambitions lead him to leap into headlines by daring performances. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2683.76s)]
*  Like a red thread, the predominance of this mechanism for immediate satisfaction runs [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2688.56s)]
*  through the history of every psychopath. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2693.0s)]
*  It explains not only his behavior, but also the violent nature of his acts. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2695.52s)]
*  The psychopath, says Mailer, is in perpetual struggle against the restrictions that are [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2701.24s)]
*  placed on him by society. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2708.9599999999996s)]
*  All restrictions. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2711.52s)]
*  All at once. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2712.52s)]
*  All the time. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2713.52s)]
*  And he says that the psychopath has this in common with the negro, who has been shaped [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2714.56s)]
*  into a perpetual rebel by his history and experience. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2719.3599999999997s)]
*  Mailer is singing the praises of the psychopath, the hipster, the white negro, as being incapable [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2725.36s)]
*  of acting on behalf of others just after Martin Luther King's bus boycott in Montgomery. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2731.2400000000002s)]
*  But Mailer would not have found any contradiction in that. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2737.44s)]
*  To Mailer, Martin Luther King was not hip. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2740.56s)]
*  He was a square. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2742.8s)]
*  And Mailer had little to no interest in King's call for black people to be allowed into the [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2744.44s)]
*  conformist, white, bourgeois society. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2749.76s)]
*  Mailer might have said that the negro actually had an advantage for being excluded from that [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2754.52s)]
*  society. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2758.28s)]
*  It gave him more freedom, not less. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2759.28s)]
*  Quote, the only hip morality is to do what one feels whenever and wherever it is possible. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2761.28s)]
*  And this is how the war of the hip and the square begins. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2767.84s)]
*  To be engaged in one primal battle. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2771.56s)]
*  To open the limits of the possible for oneself. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2774.12s)]
*  For oneself alone, because that is one's need. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2776.82s)]
*  Yet, in widening the arena of the possible, one widens it reciprocally for others as well, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2779.88s)]
*  so that the nihilistic fulfillment of each man's desire contains its antithesis of human [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2784.92s)]
*  cooperation. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2789.56s)]
*  End quote. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2790.56s)]
*  If you're asking yourself what this has to do with the black experience in America, or [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2793.56s)]
*  the conditions of life for people with kids living in the ghetto, the answer is that except [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2797.76s)]
*  maybe in some very oblique, abstract sense, basically nothing. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2803.8s)]
*  If you're not so familiar with the era, Sartre and Mailer, these aren't just random names [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2809.48s)]
*  I'm pulling out of a hat. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2814.08s)]
*  These are two of the most influential radical intellectuals of the age. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2815.12s)]
*  Sartre arguably the most influential, certainly in Europe. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2819.76s)]
*  Mailer wrote or said somewhere in 1959 that, the sour truth is that I am imprisoned with [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2826.08s)]
*  a perception that will settle for nothing less than making a revolution in the consciousness [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2831.12s)]
*  of our time. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2835.1s)]
*  And that's fine, okay. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2836.1s)]
*  But this is not a man who is primarily concerned with civil rights or the material improvement [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2838.58s)]
*  of the lives of black people. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2843.7s)]
*  As one of the godfathers of the counterculture, you know, he had a different program in mind. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2846.34s)]
*  The radical priest, Daniel Berrigan, radical left-wing priest in the 1960s, said that to [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2853.94s)]
*  be radical is habitually to do things which society at large despises, which is true perhaps [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2861.38s)]
*  as an observation. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2868.14s)]
*  But for many of the radicals in the 1960s, the causality and the purpose was reversed, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2869.52s)]
*  you know, including for Berrigan himself. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2874.24s)]
*  For a lot of them, doing things despised by society at large became the point rather than [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2876.54s)]
*  an unavoidable side effect of the pursuit of justice. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2882.8799999999997s)]
*  In political action, as in avant-garde art and literature, getting attention by outraging [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2888.08s)]
*  normies, by being unconventional, anti-conventional at all costs, for any reason, that became [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2894.46s)]
*  the goal itself. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2900.5s)]
*  This eventually consumed the movement and really destroyed a lot of people because while [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2904.26s)]
*  famous intellectuals and Ivy League grad students might be able to devote themselves to doing [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2908.7s)]
*  things that the rest of society despises without destroying their lives, most people can't. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2914.26s)]
*  By 1969, we have Jerry Rubin, very famous 1960s protest leader, writing in the New York [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2920.78s)]
*  Book Review, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2927.82s)]
*  Who the hell wants to make it in America anymore? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2929.26s)]
*  The hippie yippie SDS movement is a white nigger movement. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2932.2200000000003s)]
*  The American economy no longer needs young whites and blacks. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2936.0400000000004s)]
*  We are waste material. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2939.2200000000003s)]
*  We fulfill our destiny and life by rejecting a system which rejects us. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2940.7200000000003s)]
*  That's nice for Jerry Rubin, who was rich. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2946.5400000000004s)]
*  He had, by the early 1970s, had abandoned any pretense of concern for social or racial [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2949.58s)]
*  justice. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2955.14s)]
*  He decided all that was passe and turned his focus to seeking enlightenment through a plethora [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2956.14s)]
*  of self-improvement and consciousness-raising fads. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2962.2599999999998s)]
*  From Christopher Lash's book, The Culture of Narcissism, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2966.2599999999998s)]
*  Quote, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2969.02s)]
*  Having reached the dreaded age of 30 and having found himself face to face with his private [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2970.02s)]
*  fears and anxieties, Rubin moved from New York to San Francisco, where he shops voraciously [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2974.74s)]
*  on an apparently inexhaustible income in the spiritual supermarkets of the West Coast. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2980.18s)]
*  In five years, Rubin says, from 1971 to 1975, I directly experienced est, gestalt therapy, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2986.66s)]
*  bioenergetics, rolfing, massage, jogging, health foods, tai chi, esalen, hypnotism, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=2994.7s)]
*  modern dance, meditation, silva mind control, eureka, acupuncture, sex therapy, rikian therapy, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3001.8599999999997s)]
*  and morehouse, a smorgasbord course in new consciousness. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3009.58s)]
*  In his coyly titled memoir, Growing Up at 37, Rubin testifies to the salutary effects [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3014.18s)]
*  of his therapeutic regimen. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3019.8999999999996s)]
*  After years of neglecting his body, he gave himself permission to be healthy and quickly [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3021.96s)]
*  lost 30 pounds. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3026.9399999999996s)]
*  Physical foods, jogging, yoga, sauna baths, chiropractors, and acupuncturists made him [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3028.86s)]
*  feel at 37 like 25. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3032.86s)]
*  Spiritual progress proved equally gratifying and painless. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3036.9s)]
*  He shed his protective armor, his sexism, his addiction to love, and learned, to love [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3040.02s)]
*  myself enough that I do not need another to make me happy. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3045.9s)]
*  He came to understand that his revolutionary politics had merely concealed a Puritan conditioning, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3049.9s)]
*  which occasionally made him uneasy about his celebrity and material rewards, but no strenuous [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3055.78s)]
*  psychic exertion seemed to have been required to convince Rubin that it's okay to enjoy [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3060.6600000000003s)]
*  the rewards of life that money brings. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3065.0800000000004s)]
*  He learned to put sex in its proper place and to enjoy it without investing it with [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3068.26s)]
*  symbolic meaning. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3073.0800000000004s)]
*  Under the influence of a succession of psychic healers, he raged against his parents and [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3075.28s)]
*  the righteous, punitive judge within himself. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3079.5s)]
*  Also where Rubin himself wrote, quote, Puritanism, by which as far as I can tell he means traditional [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3085.06s)]
*  behavioral codes and conformity of any kind, leads us to Vietnam. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3093.22s)]
*  Sexual insecurity results in a super masculinity trip called imperialism. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3099.2999999999997s)]
*  American foreign policy, especially in Vietnam, makes no sense except sexually. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3104.2999999999997s)]
*  The revolution declares war on original sin, the dictatorship of parents over their kids, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3109.5s)]
*  Christian morality, capitalism, and super masculinity trips. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3114.62s)]
*  Our tactic is to send niggers and long haired scum invading white middle class homes, fucking [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3118.58s)]
*  on the living room floor, crashing on the chandeliers, spewing sperm on the Jesus pictures, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3123.38s)]
*  breaking the furniture, and smashing Sunday school napalm blood America forever. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3128.74s)]
*  And of course America is spelled with a K, because you've got to spell it with a K to [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3133.38s)]
*  show them you mean business, right? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3138.74s)]
*  Now Rubin, who I'm not a fan of, as you can tell from my tone of voice, but he's a representative [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3141.3s)]
*  of many people in the protest movement in the late 60s, especially among the leadership. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3151.5s)]
*  They were very turned on by the idea of protest in general. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3158.1000000000004s)]
*  And for a time, for a brief moment in the 1960s, the African American came to embody [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3163.6600000000003s)]
*  that principle of protest for them. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3169.8s)]
*  And to many of these people, well, to many of these people, that's really all that they were. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3172.4s)]
*  A black person wasn't really serving the function that had been assigned to them unless they [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3182.4s)]
*  were playing this role, to the point that you would find a white writer like Irving [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3187.6400000000003s)]
*  Howe criticizing the black writer Ralph Ellison for concluding his famous novel Invisible [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3192.92s)]
*  Man with an assertion that a kind of inner freedom is possible without respect to external [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3198.68s)]
*  circumstances. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3202.3199999999997s)]
*  Howe criticized Ellison saying that to write simply about the Negro experience with the [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3203.3199999999997s)]
*  aesthetic distance urged by critics of the 50s is a moral and psychological impossibility [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3208.64s)]
*  because plight and protest are inseparable from that experience. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3213.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay, really? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3218.64s)]
*  I wasn't able to find a record of Ralph Ellison's response to Howe's attempt to teach him about [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3221.68s)]
*  the black experience. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3226.96s)]
*  You know, it's a mentality that sometimes leaks through today, undiluted, when you see [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3228.96s)]
*  people, white people even, we'll call black people sellouts or Uncle Toms, you know, tell [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3232.92s)]
*  them they're not real black people unless they take an oppositional stance to the mainstream [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3238.48s)]
*  or provide support for some specific array of political causes, which are not objectionable [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3242.8s)]
*  in themselves and may in many cases be perfectly appropriate. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3248.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, but there's something else going on when you've got white people conditioning [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3252.38s)]
*  someone's black identity on their political positions. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3255.94s)]
*  It means that it's not really about the person you're talking to, it's more about yourself. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3259.02s)]
*  And over time this dynamic became very toxic and self-destructive in the 60s and 70s. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3265.02s)]
*  Jerry Rubin wanting to spew sperm on the Jesus pictures, that would have been just as alienating [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3272.02s)]
*  and offensive to Martin Luther King and black church ladies as it was to Billy Graham, who [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3277.18s)]
*  was really his target. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3282.86s)]
*  And yet, the black protest movement had always to a degree depended on white support. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3285.36s)]
*  You know, the black people provided the leadership and the energy and the manpower, but they [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3291.36s)]
*  still needed white people for financial support, political and legal support, media support, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3295.6400000000003s)]
*  because you know, they had the money, they had the access to the institutions. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3304.6s)]
*  And so what the white people wanted to see mattered, because they were the ones often [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3309.58s)]
*  who got to decide whose organization got funding. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3315.16s)]
*  They decided who got media attention, who got bailed out of jail and who got to rot [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3318.3199999999997s)]
*  when they got picked up, who got a fancy pay lawyer and who got a public defender. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3322.36s)]
*  And by the late 60s, it was very clear that the white people pulling the strings, who [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3328.96s)]
*  got to pick the winners and losers in the black protest movement, they didn't want stoic [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3333.7s)]
*  black preachers. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3337.42s)]
*  They wanted the crazy Negro who scared the shit out of their conservative parents and [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3338.94s)]
*  drove Richard Nixon crazy. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3342.36s)]
*  And the black leaders who were willing to play that role, and many of them realized [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3344.88s)]
*  it was just a role, they would write about this. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3349.64s)]
*  Some of the Panthers would write about how they would have to play up this aspect of [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3352.54s)]
*  it because that was what people wanted to see. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3356.52s)]
*  You know, those those ones willing to do that were the ones who got the attention and the [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3359.86s)]
*  support necessary to move them to the center of the action. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3363.12s)]
*  And before long, that's what the movement really became about. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3366.48s)]
*  That's how we ended up with legions of white people following a guy like Eldridge Cleaver [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3372.06s)]
*  or George Jackson. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3376.38s)]
*  Pimps, murderers, rapists who spent much of their lives brutalizing other black people. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3378.1s)]
*  And when young black people were coming of age and they wanted to get involved, you know, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3386.78s)]
*  they wanted to do something constructive, they're looking for role models, they look [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3391.14s)]
*  they found. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3395.2799999999997s)]
*  Men who they never would have discovered, never would have heard of in a million years [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3397.52s)]
*  if it wasn't for white activists, white publishers, white lawyers, white celebrities selecting [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3403.24s)]
*  men like that for their own reasons that often had very little to do with getting positive [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3408.2s)]
*  results on the far end for black mothers and kids. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3413.7s)]
*  That's just the reality. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3416.2999999999997s)]
*  You don't have to take my word for it. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3417.2999999999997s)]
*  You can take Malcolm X's word, Stokely Carmichael's word. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3419.12s)]
*  They would talk about this all the time. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3421.9s)]
*  A few years back, a friend was visiting me from New York for a few days actually. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3425.94s)]
*  This is a story. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3430.34s)]
*  I knew this guy mostly online but we known each other for several years and he was passing [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3431.98s)]
*  through LA so he was staying with me for a few days. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3435.94s)]
*  And while he was in town, two of his friends from back in New York were coming through. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3439.1s)]
*  And they were a couple of young guys, early to mid-20s from very wealthy families on the [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3444.38s)]
*  Upper East Side and they were on a long summer road trip and so we met them for dinner one night. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3449.64s)]
*  This is such a vivid memory for me. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3457.64s)]
*  This was in summer of 2014 and so we're out to dinner and we're talking about politics [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3458.7999999999997s)]
*  and I'm mostly just listening because these guys are all very politically active. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3463.16s)]
*  They did a lot of work on local campaigns back in New York. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3467.56s)]
*  Very into the nitty-gritty and I don't have any experience with that so I'm just enjoying [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3471.3199999999997s)]
*  listening to them talk inside baseball. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3475.08s)]
*  And they mention that after LA they're heading back East because there was a protest scheduled [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3478.42s)]
*  in Ferguson, Missouri and they were going to go participate and show their support. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3483.12s)]
*  This was after the Michael Brown shooting and so after dinner we're at their car and [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3488.2400000000002s)]
*  one of them opens up the trunk to show us how prepared they are for this protest. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3493.84s)]
*  And they've got helmets and they've got spray cans. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3498.04s)]
*  They've got, one of them's got an expandable baton, a whole bunch of gear like they're [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3501.4s)]
*  going into a war zone and I'll never forget this because a little while later the Ferguson [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3506.62s)]
*  protest happens and I'm watching it on the news and a reporter was interviewing a black [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3512.42s)]
*  man who was marching and the way this happened just burned the whole incident into my memory. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3518.62s)]
*  The guy who was in his 30s or 40s and from the community is trying to talk to this reporter [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3525.1s)]
*  about the police department in the city and explain some of the kinds of things that have [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3530.94s)]
*  been commonplace before the Michael Brown shooting and of course the reporter just keeps [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3535.56s)]
*  asking the guy, do you think it's going to get violent tonight? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3540.52s)]
*  Hey, do you think it's going to get violent? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3542.68s)]
*  And I've looked over, I've looked all over the internet trying to find this footage again. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3545.44s)]
*  I wish I could play it for you but I just haven't been able to find it. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3548.56s)]
*  And the black guy keeps telling the reporter, you know, I don't know anything about any [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3551.68s)]
*  violence. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3556.12s)]
*  That's not what this is about. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3557.12s)]
*  And he's trying to steer the reporter back to the topics that he wants to talk about [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3558.2s)]
*  And this is as they're marching so they're talking and walking. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3562.54s)]
*  And finally the reporter just keeps up and he tells the reporter, look, if you want to [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3566.22s)]
*  talk to somebody about violence, go talk to some of these white people from out of town. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3570.22s)]
*  We don't know who these people are. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3574.22s)]
*  They don't even live here. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3575.74s)]
*  Go talk to one of them. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3576.74s)]
*  And sure enough, the protests turned into a riot and buildings got burned and people [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3579.2999999999997s)]
*  got hurt and hundreds of people got arrested. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3583.18s)]
*  And I mean you can probably tell from the way that I talk about this issue, not just [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3586.9s)]
*  here but in a lot of this series, this experience that I had with these two guys just before [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3590.92s)]
*  seeing that interview kind of radicalized me on this issue. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3596.92s)]
*  And I have and I don't mean to generalize, you know, and I'm not making a real general [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3600.96s)]
*  commentary about, you know, everybody's motivations but there's a certain type out there that [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3607.56s)]
*  I saw in these two guys and I have very little patience for it. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3614.04s)]
*  You know, these two guys that I met were not bringing all that gear to Ferguson just in [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3619.1800000000003s)]
*  case. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3622.7400000000002s)]
*  You don't drive halfway across the country with a trunk full of riot gear hoping that [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3624.1000000000004s)]
*  you won't have to use it. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3627.9s)]
*  I always try not to let my politics leak out on this podcast but this really has more to [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3631.5800000000004s)]
*  do with class than ideology for me. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3636.78s)]
*  You know, those guys, they just got to go home afterward. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3640.1800000000003s)]
*  Whatever happened. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3643.3s)]
*  Tell all their friends about how intense it was out in Ferguson. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3644.6200000000003s)]
*  Zero consequences. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3647.7599999999998s)]
*  Even if they got arrested. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3649.4799999999996s)]
*  Even if they got charged. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3650.4799999999996s)]
*  There were real people with real grievances in Ferguson who were going to have to live [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3653.08s)]
*  with the aftermath of a riot in their town and these guys were treating it like it was [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3657.3999999999996s)]
*  an extreme sport and felt supremely righteous for doing it. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3661.12s)]
*  And it grates on me to this day when I think about it. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3665.56s)]
*  But to a significant degree, this was happening in the late 1960s at a mass scale. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3668.68s)]
*  White radicals covering themselves in the righteousness of the black struggle, egging [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3676.98s)]
*  on and providing financial and moral support to the worst impulses in some of the worst [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3681.3s)]
*  people in the black movement. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3686.7400000000002s)]
*  Impulses that Martin Luther King spent his life fighting against were being funded and [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3689.26s)]
*  promoted by white radicals and white celebrities. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3693.9s)]
*  And so in the last years of the 1960s and the first years of the 70s, the movement blew [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3697.38s)]
*  up and we all know what happened next. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3701.66s)]
*  You know, November 1972, Richard Nixon is re-elected in one of the biggest landslides [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3705.8s)]
*  in American history. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3710.96s)]
*  He won 520 of 538 electoral votes. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3711.96s)]
*  He only lost one state, Massachusetts, because the Democrats vice presidential candidate [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3715.84s)]
*  was a member of the Kennedy family. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3720.0800000000004s)]
*  And you go back and read accounts of the campaign like Hunter S. Thompson's fear and loathing [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3722.44s)]
*  in the 72 campaign trail. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3727.56s)]
*  And so many people were sure that all the energy, the white youth vote was going to [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3730.56s)]
*  come out in unprecedented numbers and throw Nixon out. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3734.42s)]
*  They didn't show up at all. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3736.98s)]
*  That New York Times series on the South Bronx, it came out in January of 73. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3740.5s)]
*  And so it was being worked on while people went to the polls that November of 72. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3746.78s)]
*  And people read it. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3750.94s)]
*  It was a good story. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3751.94s)]
*  But when it dropped, it landed with a thud. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3752.94s)]
*  You know, people were over it. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3755.6800000000003s)]
*  By 1973, the movement was over. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3757.5400000000004s)]
*  The people who had spent their late 60s college years protesting, they woke up in a fog, decided [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3762.18s)]
*  it was time to get their lives together. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3769.24s)]
*  And they followed Jerry Rubinoff into the smorgasbord of enlightenment fads that swept [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3771.2799999999997s)]
*  the country in the 1970s. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3775.2s)]
*  I mean, it just blew up. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3776.2s)]
*  The white people did that anyway. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3779.56s)]
*  You can go look at video after video of these S seminars and radical confrontation groups [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3780.72s)]
*  and yoga classes, and you almost never see a black face. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3785.52s)]
*  They're still in the ghetto, which now is burned up from all the riots. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3788.28s)]
*  The white people had moved on to the next thing. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3794.0800000000004s)]
*  After civil rights protests, it stopped giving them the emotional and psychological rewards [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3796.28s)]
*  that they needed from it. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3801.02s)]
*  They rationalized it. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3803.7200000000003s)]
*  They said, you can't fix the world until you fix yourself. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3804.7200000000003s)]
*  OK, true enough. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3808.02s)]
*  Or actually, it's not the world that's broken at all. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3811.1600000000003s)]
*  It's our own perspective that makes it seem broken. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3813.52s)]
*  If we feel any dissatisfaction with the state of the world, it's not actually the world [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3817.8399999999997s)]
*  that needs adjusting, but ourselves. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3821.3599999999997s)]
*  Which again, there's something to that. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3824.52s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3826.56s)]
*  You can find some truth in that. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3827.56s)]
*  But go tell that to the South Bronx mother with moldy walls and no heat and mice crawling [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3828.56s)]
*  over her sick kids while they sleep. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3831.8799999999997s)]
*  Go tell her that what she really needs is a $100 an hour Tai Chi seminar. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3834.04s)]
*  But nobody was telling her anything anymore. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3840.4399999999996s)]
*  Nobody was even talking to that woman anymore. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3842.72s)]
*  Some people debate over whether Tom Wolfe calling the 70s the me decade was entirely [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3846.24s)]
*  appropriate, but that label stuck for a reason. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3851.2799999999997s)]
*  On top of all the fads that Jerry Rubin listed off, there were a thousand more. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3854.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, it was the thing back then. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3859.12s)]
*  People were following gurus and joining cults of every sort, especially on the West Coast. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3862.4799999999996s)]
*  And what political energy still existed on the left retreated into the isolation of individual [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3867.8399999999997s)]
*  issues. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3874.8799999999997s)]
*  The movement splintered into the feminist movement, the gay rights movement, the environmental [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3876.52s)]
*  movement, which today all of these movements have kind of found their way back to each [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3880.12s)]
*  other and they cooperate pretty well. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3885.28s)]
*  But after the splintering back then, these individual issue movements often had as little [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3886.92s)]
*  to do with each other as they did with the religious right. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3891.48s)]
*  Nixon's enemies managed to get him out in 1974, of course, but that episode just shows [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3896.56s)]
*  how inexorable the shift in his direction really was. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3902.04s)]
*  Despite the humiliation and ugliness of the Watergate episode, I mean, after that, you [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3907.1600000000003s)]
*  might have expected Democrats and the left to dominate for the next generation. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3912.84s)]
*  But Ronald Reagan became president in 1980 and codified this generational transformation [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3916.76s)]
*  of American politics to such a degree that today even Democrats invoke Reagan's name. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3921.6s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats fight over who's more Reagan-esque. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3928.88s)]
*  When the Democrats finally got the White House back in the 1990s, it was on Bill Clinton's [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3934.7200000000003s)]
*  platform of free trade, deregulation, cutting welfare, harsh criminal justice reform. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3939.8s)]
*  I mean, this sounds maybe sounds crazy to people, but it's really not an exaggeration. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3946.44s)]
*  Nixon was to the left of Clinton in many ways. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3951.76s)]
*  That's how thoroughly over the 1960s protest movement the country was, and that lasted [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3954.88s)]
*  really until things began to shift again in the last few years, like in the mid 2010s. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3962.1600000000003s)]
*  It wasn't just the protest movement, though. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3968.76s)]
*  The Reagan-Thatcher revolution of the 80s, it really marked the end of a whole way of [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3972.12s)]
*  approaching political and social questions that had begun with the early 20th century [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3977.42s)]
*  progressive movements tried to professionalize the government and came into its own during [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3982.9s)]
*  the Depression and Second World War when the government took on roles and responsibilities [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3987.1400000000003s)]
*  that were of a scale and purpose nobody really envisioned before, and then reached its brief [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3991.38s)]
*  apotheosis when that World War II generation took the reins in the 1960s, the great society. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=3997.38s)]
*  It was this modernist idea that politics doesn't have to just be a means of managing power [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4004.5s)]
*  relations and distributing social goods. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4010.46s)]
*  It can be a vehicle to realize these grand collective ambitions and to expertly engineer [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4013.94s)]
*  and manage society. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4019.46s)]
*  And not just politics, it was a broader social approach. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4022.66s)]
*  Experts of every field could be mobilized to create positive change. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4026.58s)]
*  This was at a time when technology seemed to be making life better for everyone, and [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4031.02s)]
*  that influenced the way people approached every problem. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4034.78s)]
*  It was just a matter of putting the best minds on the job, getting the formula right. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4037.58s)]
*  Even art and architecture and civil engineering had their role to play. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4043.3s)]
*  The 1950s were a golden age of modernist architecture. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4047.5s)]
*  You saw giant government housing projects springing up in cities all over the country [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4050.7s)]
*  with great fanfare because they weren't just affordable places for people to live. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4055.94s)]
*  They'd been designed with this belief that the physical environment could be engineered [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4059.98s)]
*  in such a way that better people and healthier communities would just be the natural result. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4065.38s)]
*  It was a disaster almost everywhere. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4070.62s)]
*  The emblematic disaster was the Pruitt-Igoe housing project in St. Louis. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4075.78s)]
*  It's just remembered as sort of the ultimate failure of this approach, but it was demolished [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4082.86s)]
*  in 1973. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4088.9s)]
*  People really believed that even human happiness and social harmony, that these were technical [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4092.7799999999997s)]
*  problems that smart people could sit down around a table and solve with technical solutions. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4099.86s)]
*  The Pruitt-Igoe project went up in the late 50s. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4106.26s)]
*  It's just block after block of hideous tenement buildings with brilliant features like elevators [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4108.78s)]
*  that only stopped every fourth or fifth floor so that most people who don't live on those [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4116.86s)]
*  floors would have to get off the elevator and walk up the stairs a few floors to their [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4121.82s)]
*  apartment. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4127.0199999999995s)]
*  This would make people physically healthier, but it would also encourage those daily spontaneous [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4128.179999999999s)]
*  meetings and interactions, neighbors bumping into each other, and that would build social [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4133.5s)]
*  bonds and knit the community together. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4137.299999999999s)]
*  I'm going to come up with that idea back then. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4139.9s)]
*  It sounds great. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4141.5s)]
*  It always sounds great. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4142.9s)]
*  Less than 20 years after Pruitt-Igoe projects were built, they were so dangerous that mailmen [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4147.18s)]
*  refused to deliver mail there, and the buildings and infrastructure were so ruined that it [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4152.18s)]
*  was decided there was nothing to do but to just eat the cost to demolish the entire thing. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4157.58s)]
*  The demolition of Pruitt-Igoe has been called the end of modernist architecture of that [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4163.9s)]
*  movement, but the failure was part of a broader shift in how people thought about social problems [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4168.18s)]
*  in general. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4173.98s)]
*  People thought it had turned out that putting the smartest minds on problems like crime [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4176.98s)]
*  and urban decay hadn't helped at all. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4181.78s)]
*  In fact, it just seemed to be making things worse than ever. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4185.22s)]
*  That same year that Pruitt-Igoe was being demolished, another project by the same architect [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4189.54s)]
*  was being dedicated that encapsulates the transition that was happening, I think, better [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4195.54s)]
*  than just about anything I could think of, and that was the World Trade Center. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4200.42s)]
*  Same architect. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4204.62s)]
*  One's being demolished the same year, the other one's being dedicated. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4205.74s)]
*  I think that just captures the transition that was taking place from an era where people [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4209.86s)]
*  believed in big ideas and collective achievements like the Great Society toward the neoliberal [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4214.74s)]
*  era of dominant global capitalism that's played out from the 1980s until the present day. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4222.14s)]
*  In this era, even among Democrats, politics has more or less followed Reagan's theme that [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4228.42s)]
*  government cannot really solve our problems, cannot really solve any major problem, if [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4235.66s)]
*  anything it is the problem, and that we should all be casting a suspicious eye toward anyone [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4240.5s)]
*  who shows up with a grand plan about how to make society better. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4247.38s)]
*  If you want to help your society, the way to do it is to start a business, create some [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4251.94s)]
*  jobs, make as much money as possible, and like George W. Bush said after 9-11, go shopping. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4256.66s)]
*  Stimulate the economy. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4262.58s)]
*  If there are people in the ghetto who want to live a different kind of life than the [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4264.98s)]
*  one they're living, and they're committed to pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4268.099999999999s)]
*  fantastic, we should find ways to help them do that. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4271.98s)]
*  For all the rest, hey, that's why we've got police and prisons. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4275.74s)]
*  Of course this transition did not happen all at once, it's not how these kind of things [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4281.98s)]
*  work, and so not everybody's ready to give up the fight right away, it's not like we [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4285.54s)]
*  and the next day everybody decided on a new program or a new way of approaching these [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4290.38s)]
*  things. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4295.34s)]
*  In the early 70s, there were still a lot of people hanging on, even to the idea of revolution, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4296.34s)]
*  long after most people had moved on, but as people were moving on, the ones who left first, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4302.5s)]
*  it was the moderate and the half committed people who began to filter out of the movement, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4310.22s)]
*  and as that process took place, what was left was the distilled radical essence. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4314.86s)]
*  As groups like the Weathermen and the Black Liberation Army dragged what was left of the [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4322.58s)]
*  movement further and further to the militant fringe and made the movement more unfashionable [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4327.0599999999995s)]
*  and distasteful to more and more people, the ones who did stick around were very committed, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4332.099999999999s)]
*  but also often just people who had nothing else to do or nowhere else to go or who were [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4339.74s)]
*  simply just kind of crazy. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4345.339999999999s)]
*  The hospital that I mentioned in the South Bronx near the beginning, it's a good example [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4349.38s)]
*  of what I'm talking about, it's called Lincoln Hospital and it's still there in Mott Haven, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4353.66s)]
*  the pretty legit medical center now from what I understand, but that was not the case back [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4361.0599999999995s)]
*  when the New York Times was writing about it in 1973. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4365.9s)]
*  It was a run down chaotic mess that had been condemned in 1949, but in 1973 remained as [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4369.82s)]
*  the only medical facility serving all 400,000 residents of the South Bronx. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4378.179999999999s)]
*  People would wait all day hoping to be seen, sometimes they wouldn't, and so the residents [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4383.9s)]
*  sometimes would stage sit-ins and protest demanding improvements and in 1969 gangs got [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4390.18s)]
*  in on the action, they started occupying whole wards of the hospital, protesting but also [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4397.02s)]
*  just kind of hanging out all day and night harassing the doctors and nurses and administrators. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4402.42s)]
*  One morning in July 1970, dozens of members of the Young Lords invaded Lincoln Hospital [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4408.9800000000005s)]
*  and barricaded themselves in the old nursing building and raised the Puerto Rican flag [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4415.5s)]
*  above the roof. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4419.38s)]
*  The Young Lords were like a, this isn't exactly right, but they're like a Puerto Rican Black [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4420.9400000000005s)]
*  Panthers kind of, and they presented a list of demands to the administration, you know, [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4425.86s)]
*  house calls in the community had come to a halt because doctors would get harassed or [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4431.900000000001s)]
*  attacked whenever they went out into the neighborhoods, the Young Lords wanted those resumed, okay, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4436.0s)]
*  cool, they wanted a daycare center to be established for the community and a 24 hour grievance [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4441.54s)]
*  table that would be manned by members of the community, but they also wanted the hospital [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4446.9s)]
*  administration purged and replaced with people from the community and from the hospital staff [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4452.259999999999s)]
*  who were approved by the Young Lords. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4457.86s)]
*  So the Young Lords held the nursing building but they started moving out into the rest [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4462.42s)]
*  of the area, the rest of the hospital and they're dominating the corridors of Lincoln [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4466.219999999999s)]
*  Hospital, harassing and intimidating the staff, especially the Korean and Filipino American [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4469.66s)]
*  doctors and nurses that they wanted replaced by Puerto Rican doctors and nurses. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4476.26s)]
*  And so the staff, they were staging walkouts and protests, many of them resigned, and so [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4482.42s)]
*  you know, the manning became worse than it was before, but the ones who stayed behind, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4487.900000000001s)]
*  they just tried to get on with their duties while they're being, literally doctors and [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4494.14s)]
*  nurses being pushed around and cursed at and threatened as they're trying to do their [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4497.62s)]
*  jobs by these activists slash gang members. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4501.780000000001s)]
*  And this is daily life at Lincoln Hospital for months. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4505.219999999999s)]
*  And so in November, the Young Lords barged in with a few dozen drug addicts and they [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4509.94s)]
*  took over an upper floor auditorium and they demanded that the administration give them, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4515.9s)]
*  the Young Lords, the space and the resources to open up their own drug treatment center [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4520.34s)]
*  in the hospital. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4525.179999999999s)]
*  The hospital already had a methadone clinic but it was small and nowhere near what was [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4527.42s)]
*  needed to serve the needs of the South Bronx. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4531.38s)]
*  Several more hospitals would have been needed for that. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4533.34s)]
*  But the administration didn't know what to do and so they felt like they had no choice [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4537.3s)]
*  but to give in to the Young Lords demands. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4540.78s)]
*  So they let them keep the auditorium, they gave that to them to set up their clinic, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4542.78s)]
*  they gave them some office space in the hospital and they diverted one million dollars in state [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4546.96s)]
*  and city funding to the project which became known as Lincoln Detox. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4551.7s)]
*  It's from the author Brian Burrow. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4556.14s)]
*  Quote. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4559.02s)]
*  It was like no other clinic in New York. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4561.38s)]
*  Run by radicals who established a socialist collective to administer it, Lincoln Detox [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4564.34s)]
*  drew many of its volunteers and paid staff from the ranks of New York's militant leftists. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4568.7s)]
*  They adorned its walls with photos of Che Guevara, Malcolm X and in time Joanne Chesimart. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4574.18s)]
*  Its volunteers included Michael Seto-Wayo-Taber and Afini Shakur of the Panther 21, Brian [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4582.38s)]
*  Flanagan from the Weather Underground as well as Bernadine Dorn's sister Jennifer who fell [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4588.58s)]
*  for a Young Lords leader, Mickey Melendez, with whom she had three children. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4592.0599999999995s)]
*  Practically overnight, Lincoln Detox became a kind of clubhouse for New York's radical [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4596.679999999999s)]
*  elite. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4600.78s)]
*  When the Black Liberation Army needed medical supplies in 1971, the radicals at Lincoln [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4601.86s)]
*  turned them over by the truckload. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4606.54s)]
*  But it was the treatment Lincoln Detox offered that was truly radical in every sense of the [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4608.94s)]
*  word. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4613.0199999999995s)]
*  It was an article of faith among many militants that the plague of drugs was a scheme concocted [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4614.08s)]
*  by a white government to oppress blacks. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4618.78s)]
*  This theory had been popularized by Malcolm X who preached that drug addiction could be [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4621.5599999999995s)]
*  cured by freeing blacks of the self-hatred indoctrinated by whites. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4625.84s)]
*  At Lincoln, this meant augmenting methadone with a regiment of political education classes [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4630.16s)]
*  that included Marxist literature and lectures, all paid for with city funding. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4634.68s)]
*  Every addict was given an 86 page pamphlet called The Opium Trail, Heroin and Imperialism, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4639.76s)]
*  which claimed, among other eye-opening assertions, that a commitment to armed revolution could [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4645.56s)]
*  cure heroin addiction better than methadone alone. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4649.88s)]
*  By providing an alternative explanation and another focus for anger, its authors wrote, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4653.22s)]
*  as well as collective support and some sense of direction, the movement can be the best [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4658.14s)]
*  form of therapy. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4663.1s)]
*  Human administrators, many of whom appeared intimidated by detox staffers, tolerated most [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4665.9s)]
*  of it, only occasionally attempting to rein in the radicals as when one acting director, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4670.86s)]
*  new to the job, switched off the power when a group of 150 staffers and junkies commandeered [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4675.74s)]
*  the chapel to screen a documentary about a Mozambican revolutionary group. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4680.78s)]
*  When the detox crowd refused to leave, police and security guards were called, leading to [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4685.42s)]
*  the predictable melee. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4689.9s)]
*  23 people were arrested. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4691.259999999999s)]
*  An interesting side story having to do with Lincoln Detox, one of the people who came [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4694.22s)]
*  to volunteer was a young black radical named Jirah Williams, who would later become a Muslim [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4698.780000000001s)]
*  and change his name to Matullu Shakur. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4704.9400000000005s)]
*  In the past, he had been part of a hardcore black nationalist group with designs on carving [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4708.14s)]
*  out several southern US states as a black homeland. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4712.0s)]
*  They even elected a provisional black government to run the new country. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4714.820000000001s)]
*  And it fell apart for the usual reasons, infighting, pressure from law enforcement. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4719.18s)]
*  And eventually, Shakur makes his way up to the Bronx and Lincoln Detox. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4724.14s)]
*  He starts out as a volunteer, but he's very dedicated, very hardworking, and soon has [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4728.3s)]
*  a full-time paying gig as a drug counselor. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4733.54s)]
*  In 1974, he hooks up with a doctor who had introduced acupuncture to the clinic as a [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4736.900000000001s)]
*  drug treatment, and Matullu Shakur takes it up with religious dedication. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4743.700000000001s)]
*  And then a little bit later, he's put in charge of the acupuncture program when the doctor [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4749.4800000000005s)]
*  who introduced it to Lincoln Detox and tutored him was found dead in the hospital closet [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4753.3s)]
*  with a heroin needle in his arm. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4757.38s)]
*  And by this point, he had gotten married to a fellow hospital worker and Panther 21 veteran [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4759.62s)]
*  named Afeni Shakur and had become stepfather to her son, Tupac. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4764.7s)]
*  Perhaps you've heard of him. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4770.740000000001s)]
*  Matullu Shakur was ever only in charge of acupuncture, but he was very charismatic, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4772.780000000001s)]
*  very energetic, and somehow he managed to become so influential that people called him [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4777.1s)]
*  the deputy director of Lincoln Detox, and more often than not, they would go through [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4781.18s)]
*  him for any major decisions. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4784.620000000001s)]
*  But within a few years, he had developed a nasty cocaine habit himself, and since the [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4786.900000000001s)]
*  salary at Lincoln was not paying enough to buy a lot of cocaine, he hooked up with a [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4791.46s)]
*  bunch of other revolutionaries, including Sekou Odinga, the Black Liberation Army soldier [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4797.14s)]
*  that we talked about a bit in a previous episode, and launched a side career of armed robbery. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4801.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, Lincoln Detox is just falling apart and turning into... well, this is from Brian [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4807.9s)]
*  Burrow. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4815.58s)]
*  Quote, [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4816.58s)]
*  The trouble had been building for years. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4817.58s)]
*  The city's Addiction Services Agency, ASA, which nominally ran the clinic, had cut off [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4819.14s)]
*  all funding when Detox refused to provide census data or treatment records to justify [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4823.9400000000005s)]
*  it. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4828.54s)]
*  But the clinic still received money from a separate city agency, the Health and Hospitals [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4829.54s)]
*  Corporation. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4833.26s)]
*  Thus, one agency, ASA, had oversight but no leverage to enforce it, and a second, HHC, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4834.42s)]
*  handed over money with little supervision. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4841.1s)]
*  Neither had the power to rein in the clinic's director, Luis Cerita, who found it easy to [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4843.780000000001s)]
*  strong-arm both agencies even when impropriety surfaced. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4847.900000000001s)]
*  And surface they did. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4851.74s)]
*  A 1973 ASA audit found that Detox was treating barely half the number of drug addicts its [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4853.46s)]
*  contract specified. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4859.42s)]
*  Another noted that its treatments were four times more expensive than those at other [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4861.58s)]
*  city clinics. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4865.18s)]
*  An HHC review found nearly $1 million in unsubstantiated payroll was going out the door to unknown [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4866.94s)]
*  parties along with phenomenal absentee rates among staff members as high as 71% in some [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4872.82s)]
*  cases. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4878.1s)]
*  Only half of 45 paid staffers were on duty one day when HHC auditors arrived. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4879.54s)]
*  The staff, meanwhile, charged the clinic for thousands of dollars in personal phone calls. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4884.78s)]
*  When HHC demanded the clinic's personnel records, it simply refused, claiming the records were [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4889.66s)]
*  private. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4894.18s)]
*  When a federal grand jury investigating kickback schemes subpoenaed records of 36 patients, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4895.34s)]
*  one of the clinic's doctors refused and moved to quash the subpoena. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4900.22s)]
*  As New York City sagged into the worst fiscal crisis in its history, neither its beleaguered [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4904.099999999999s)]
*  mayor, Abe Beam, nor any of his subordinates could summon the will to do battle with the [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4908.74s)]
*  clinic's angry radicals who increasingly operated as an independent entity unanswerable to any [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4913.46s)]
*  authority. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4918.58s)]
*  Every year or two, ASA or HHC would make noises about evicting detox from the hospital. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4919.94s)]
*  Time and again, the staff organized angry protests in response. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4925.26s)]
*  In the worst, a group of detox staffers stormed HHC's downtown Manhattan offices and barricaded [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4928.94s)]
*  themselves inside while they smashed furniture and windows in the president's anteroom. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4935.3s)]
*  After that, HHC officials appeared notably reluctant to confront the clinic. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4939.94s)]
*  End quote. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4944.26s)]
*  Just think about what I just read. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4946.26s)]
*  The city and state are providing millions of dollars to a drug program that is essentially [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4949.06s)]
*  serving as a front for several radical groups, violent radical groups. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4954.74s)]
*  They're using the program to radicalize and recruit the drug addicts they're supposed [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4959.74s)]
*  to be serving. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4963.38s)]
*  Later, there would be allegations that they were using access to the methadone needed [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4964.38s)]
*  by the addicts to blackmail them into performing services for the militant groups. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4967.42s)]
*  The agencies that have oversight over this program, they find out that drugs and supplies [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4973.12s)]
*  and over $1 million are going out the door to these organizations, but when they try [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4978.66s)]
*  to do something about it, the staff invades and trashes the agency offices and the agencies [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4983.5599999999995s)]
*  back down. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4989.04s)]
*  If anybody wonders why, you know, anybody back then would have thought it was okay for [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4990.72s)]
*  an outfit like People's Temple to be running drug treatment programs or retirement homes, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=4997.4s)]
*  this is your answer. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5002.36s)]
*  They weren't linking detox with stuff like this going on. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5004.94s)]
*  The temple seemed pretty normal back in the 70s. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5007.12s)]
*  Matulishakor and Sekou Odinga, meanwhile, gather up several radical white women, primarily [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5012.04s)]

*  family, which was about 20% revolutionary movement and 80% interracial sex club that [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5027.76s)]
*  spent most of its time planning and doing robberies to support everyone's escalating [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5036.6s)]
*  cocaine habits. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5041.3s)]
*  And they persisted for quite a while in the chaos of the 70s until, infamously, in 1981, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5043.3s)]
*  several of them, six former BLA members and four former weathermen, got coked up and robbed [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5049.16s)]
*  a Brinks truck for $1.6 million. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5054.32s)]
*  It was incredibly violent. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5056.679999999999s)]
*  There was no plan at all. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5058.92s)]
*  They just sped up to the truck in broad daylight when it was open and the guards were outside [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5061.04s)]
*  and without warning, just opened fire on the guys with shotguns and automatic weapons, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5065.44s)]
*  killed two guards, severely wounded another, as they made their getaway in a U-Haul truck [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5070.719999999999s)]
*  driven by Kathy Bowden, a former weatherwoman that we talked about in a previous episode. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5076.24s)]
*  She was one of the two women who survived the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5080.26s)]
*  The truck gets pulled over by police, and the cops aren't sure that they've got the [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5085.74s)]
*  right truck. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5089.66s)]
*  It just happened. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5090.66s)]
*  And the unassuming white woman driving in the front gave them pause. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5092.46s)]
*  They were unaware of the six armed men in the back storage area, and when three of them [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5096.54s)]
*  were approaching the truck with their guns drawn, Kathy Bowden plays dumb and just acts [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5101.38s)]
*  terrified and pleased with them to put their guns away. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5105.62s)]
*  And as soon as they put their guns away, the men burst out of the back of the truck [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5108.62s)]
*  wearing body armor and open fire on the cops with automatic weapons. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5111.7s)]
*  One of them goes down, one of the robbers walks up and shoots several rounds into him [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5116.36s)]
*  to finish him off. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5120.62s)]
*  Another cop is killed with a robber's M16. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5121.82s)]
*  Another is hit in the leg. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5124.84s)]
*  He manages to get behind a tree and return some fire. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5125.84s)]
*  And another one, a fourth one, had remained in the squad car, but he couldn't get his [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5128.74s)]
*  door open because a dead cop's body was wedged against it. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5131.7s)]
*  He grabs his shotgun, gets off a few rounds at the U-Haul truck, which by this point is [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5135.22s)]
*  speeding directly at his car and hits it. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5139.3s)]
*  And now the truck isn't going anywhere, so everybody jumps out of it and some of the [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5141.900000000001s)]
*  robbers get into a vehicle that some of the other robbers are driving. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5145.780000000001s)]
*  Some of the others carjack a motorist and take off in that. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5149.54s)]
*  Again, these are not exactly criminal masterminds at work, and so they're all arrested in short [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5153.02s)]
*  order, in charge, and sent to prison. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5158.06s)]
*  Tupac's stepdad got 60 years. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5161.1s)]
*  In keeping with the spirit of the age, though, that tended to throw the book at the black [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5163.9800000000005s)]
*  radicals and spare or celebrate the white radicals, one of the white women involved, [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5169.5s)]
*  Susan Rosenberg, she went to prison, but her sentence was commuted by Bill Clinton on his [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5174.5s)]
*  very last day in office, and she's now a celebrated radical author and activist. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5179.18s)]
*  Kathy Bowden, she did some time as well, but she got out and now she's a professor at Columbia, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5185.18s)]
*  which as far as I know makes her the only current Ivy League professor to have pled [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5191.06s)]
*  guilty for felony murder of police officers. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5195.26s)]
*  My point in telling you all this, I guess, as my point has been in telling you many of [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5200.9800000000005s)]
*  the stories that are not directly related to Jim Jones or People's Temple, well, there's [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5205.820000000001s)]
*  a couple reasons, right? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5210.18s)]
*  I mean, one, this is just a period of history that it's got a lot to do with our present [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5211.18s)]
*  condition that people really don't know a lot about, and it's interesting and it's exciting, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5217.74s)]
*  and many of the people involved are still alive and influential, they're in the news. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5222.98s)]
*  One of Jim Jones' closest allies in California politics, which we'll talk about in a while, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5228.7s)]
*  was Willie Brown. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5233.26s)]
*  He used to be the boyfriend of current vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris and gave [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5234.26s)]
*  her her start in politics. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5238.62s)]
*  Susan Rosenberg, the radical I just mentioned who was released from prison by Bill Clinton, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5241.42s)]
*  she's been in the news this summer, summer 2020, because conservative pundits have had [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5246.98s)]
*  their hair on fire because she's on the board of one of the main organizations that raises [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5251.219999999999s)]
*  money for Black Lives Matter and she's highly involved in that. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5255.86s)]
*  I mentioned in a previous episode that President Obama launched his political career at a fundraiser [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5259.74s)]
*  in the living room of Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dorn, the two former leaders of the Weather [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5265.82s)]
*  Underground. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5269.5s)]
*  This stuff is not ancient history, but the real reason that I've included it is because [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5270.74s)]
*  tracing out the course of the movement from the late 50s into the 70s and seeing how it [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5277.54s)]
*  developed, it really provides the context to understand how people at the time would [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5284.42s)]
*  have thought about and perceived Jim Jones and People's Temple. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5290.7s)]
*  At no point along that trajectory were Jim or the Temple anywhere close to the most radical [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5295.96s)]
*  or the most bizarre thing going on. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5303.4s)]
*  In fact, generally speaking, they always stayed a step or two or three behind the leading [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5305.96s)]
*  edge so that even as they began to tip over in the early 70s, to someone who was happening [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5311.0s)]
*  through the church on any given Sunday, the place could have seemed like a stable, relatively [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5316.44s)]
*  conventional environment compared to what they were used to. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5321.56s)]
*  Even people who got involved, who were in the inner circle on the planning commission, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5326.360000000001s)]
*  who saw the madness that was going on behind the scenes, if they'd done time in other radical [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5329.92s)]
*  groups as many of them had, or they at least were close enough to it that they'd heard [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5335.120000000001s)]
*  the stories, the Temple would have seemed like more of the same at the very worst. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5339.6s)]
*  It's also worth pointing out critical points in the Temple's timeline and comparing it [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5346.080000000001s)]
*  to the overall timeline of the development of the movement. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5350.96s)]
*  Jim Jones moved the Temple headquarters from rural Northern California into San Francisco [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5354.52s)]
*  permanently in 1972. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5359.78s)]
*  That's pretty late in the game. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5362.28s)]
*  Near Focus had been there for a while and they'd been building a presence in Los Angeles [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5364.92s)]
*  as well, but by 1972 the field had been cleared for Jim to move into those two cities and [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5368.38s)]
*  really try to make a claim for leadership. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5374.24s)]
*  Remember, this is four years after the near revolution of 68, three years after the Panther [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5377.68s)]
*  21 were arrested and Weather disbanded SDS, two years after Kent State. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5383.8s)]
*  This is the year of Nixon's landslide victory and people living in the ghettos were looking [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5388.68s)]
*  around and realizing that the movement was over and people had moved on with their lives. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5394.84s)]
*  So that when Jim Jones rolled into their neighborhoods offering himself as a savior, he didn't have [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5401.6s)]
*  a lot of competition. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5406.36s)]
*  People's Temple straddled the beginning and end points of the movement as the author [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5409.719999999999s)]
*  Shiva Naipaul observed, quote, Jim Jones built his movement on the debris of the 60s, on [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5414.16s)]
*  its frustrations, failures, and apostasies. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5420.839999999999s)]
*  When with his small band of followers he made his hijra from Indiana to California in 1965, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5424.5199999999995s)]

*  Its climactic moments lay ahead. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5432.94s)]
*  Beatles Park was yet to be battled over and Berkeley placed under martial law. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5435.5199999999995s)]
*  San Francisco's Summer of Love was still two years away. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5439.4s)]
*  The Black Panthers did not exist. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5442.36s)]
*  Angela Davis had not been charged with conspiracy and gun running. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5444.5599999999995s)]
*  The feminist onslaught had not yet begun to make its impact. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5448.16s)]

*  The world had changed substantially when in 1972 the People's Temple moved out of its [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5485.08s)]

*  In general, Jim tended to keep the radical stuff between himself and the inner circle [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5687.860000000001s)]
*  until 72 or 73 or so. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5692.14s)]
*  Not entirely, but it leaked out rarely enough that committed members could let it pass if [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5695.46s)]
*  they didn't like it. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5700.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, he always preached radical politics, but he was talking to people in urban ghettos [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5701.700000000001s)]
*  who again were surrounded by militant rhetoric. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5707.5s)]
*  And at least Jim Jones wasn't calling for violence. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5709.780000000001s)]
*  There were many people in the church who were only there because it was a good environment [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5713.46s)]
*  for their kids. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5717.66s)]
*  It was the whole reason they were there. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5718.66s)]
*  You know, there are many people like that. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5719.66s)]
*  There are many members who stayed in the church because they'd become friends. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5722.62s)]
*  They'd become close to other people in the church. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5727.259999999999s)]
*  They didn't really care that much one way or another for Jim Jones. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5729.46s)]
*  And that's not uncommon either. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5732.5s)]
*  And people in churches all over America stick around because that's their friend group. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5733.94s)]
*  It's their kid's social environment. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5737.74s)]
*  If the pastor came in one Sunday and announced that he was moving on and there was going [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5740.5s)]
*  to be another pastor, they might be, oh, that's too bad. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5744.78s)]
*  But it's not going to break them up. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5748.66s)]
*  It's not going to cause them to leave the church or anything like that. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5751.46s)]
*  It's not out of the ordinary is my point. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5754.0199999999995s)]
*  Of course, Jim Jones was a preacher out of the ordinary. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5756.0199999999995s)]
*  Many people were uncommonly attached to him. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5759.7s)]
*  But even among those people, they were attached to him very often for different reasons. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5762.139999999999s)]
*  Jim would talk to his people on subjects that he knew appealed to only a slice of the congregation, [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5768.219999999999s)]
*  either puzzled or turned off the rest. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5773.86s)]
*  He always wanted to be all things to all people. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5776.74s)]
*  So he would jump around, give this group over here a bit of what they needed, and then give [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5778.7s)]
*  this other group what they needed. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5782.98s)]
*  For a little while, Scientology was catching on in the mid 70s in the Bay Area in LA. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5784.299999999999s)]
*  And he knew that some of his people had been looking into that. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5789.219999999999s)]
*  So one day, Jim just appropriates basically the whole Scientology myth for his own use, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5792.38s)]
*  as if he'd had some kind of revelation or something, even though a lot of the people [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5798.18s)]
*  listening to it thought he was either nuts or just goofing around. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5801.900000000001s)]
*  Your mind, the mind, you know, we have, from what I understand, you have the mind of God, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5853.02s)]
*  the perfect mind of God. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5858.14s)]
*  I have a perfect loving mind. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5859.38s)]
*  Well, perfect loving mind. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5861.5s)]
*  God is a word that I'd like to get away from because it's something that has been used [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5864.18s)]
*  so much by the church agent, and represents a false concept. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5868.34s)]
*  I'm 100% sensitive to get you to the only heaven there is, a planet out there. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5875.02s)]

*  They can't make a contact or communicate to get into your body to help you. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5905.18s)]
*  And they have no way. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5908.66s)]
*  If they had it, they do it. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5910.62s)]

*  If you raise in a mental consciousness, you can raise out. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5915.139999999999s)]
*  You could go out and go on that plane. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5918.5s)]

*  You thought you were on a good mission, I guess. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5948.18s)]
*  And you came here and I came here to get you. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5952.18s)]
*  And it's too limited a thing and it's too, it's a, it's a form of deviation. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5953.780000000001s)]
*  It can get us away from the fundamental of socialism. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5960.5s)]

*  You start to see as time goes on more and more of this kind of thing mixing in with [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5967.02s)]
*  the political message. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5970.46s)]
*  You know, Jim's message centering more on himself and his divinity. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5972.62s)]
*  Sometimes he would qualify it, bring it back to the message that God was not a being in [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5977.74s)]
*  the sky, but a principle and the spirit of love and brotherhood of which Jim himself [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5981.1s)]
*  was merely a vehicle and you know, which was embodied politically by socialism. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5986.58s)]
*  But as time wore on and his mind continued to slip and the drugs drove his megalomania [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5990.58s)]
*  higher and higher into the stratosphere, those qualifiers came with less frequency. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=5996.3s)]
*  You demand that they only speak of one God, God Jim. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6003.38s)]
*  You let them speak of only one God, the Savior that's here talking to you. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6006.86s)]
*  Don't let them talk about any other God. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6010.82s)]

*  Don't let anyone else be before me because I'm the one that will marshal our resources [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6023.74s)]

*  It's me that will unite us if we have our whole attention undivided upon me. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6029.9800000000005s)]
*  But if someone is here able to sow discord amongst the brethren, it will hinder our exodus [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6034.54s)]
*  to Babylon. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6039.34s)]

*  The temples drug rehab programs in the 1960s, California psychiatric hospital started emptying [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6073.82s)]

*  the streets and the temple took in as many of them as it could get. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6090.339999999999s)]
*  And then you just had people who had come in as joiners, you know, people who were lost [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6094.82s)]
*  or who had spent the last several years strung out and flitting from one protest group or [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6099.94s)]

*  Oh, there's little truths in that Bible. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6147.5s)]
*  But you left another planet, another heaven. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6149.46s)]
*  You left it. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6151.46s)]

*  One of the more interesting characters who came through the temple around this time was [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6324.74s)]
*  a black man named Donald DeFries. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6331.26s)]
*  DeFries' little background was born in 1943 in Cleveland, so he would have been about [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6335.179999999999s)]
*  30 when he was supposed to have attended a few Sundays at the temple in 1973. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6339.98s)]
*  His childhood was not a happy one. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6347.5s)]
*  kids and his alcoholic dad supposedly used him as a punching bag. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6350.7s)]
*  He starts getting in trouble early on for stealing cars and then he gets in trouble [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6356.7s)]
*  for stealing a gun so that he could kill his father. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6360.46s)]
*  And so he runs away to Buffalo to live with a cousin when he's 14 years old. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6363.66s)]
*  In Buffalo, he keeps stealing cars and getting in trouble and he gets put up in a youth facility [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6368.3s)]
*  until he's 18 years old, at which point he's released and then he next shows up in New [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6372.66s)]
*  York, New Jersey where he managed to get his act together for a little while. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6376.94s)]
*  He gets a job painting houses and he marries a woman five years older than him. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6381.0599999999995s)]
*  She's 23, she's already got three kids, but she's kind of got her act together and she [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6386.58s)]
*  pushes him hard to stay on the path. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6390.98s)]
*  But DeFries was sullen and lazy and they start to fight a lot and their fights are mostly [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6392.86s)]
*  her yelling at him to do something with himself. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6399.0s)]
*  And so Donald DeFries starts disappearing for days at a time and she found out later [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6400.98s)]
*  that he had started burglarizing houses and robbing people. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6405.54s)]
*  Now DeFries wasn't just a criminal, he was a very troubled guy. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6409.82s)]
*  When he was home and not off on one of his disappearances, he started buying guns and [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6414.62s)]
*  taking them apart and trying to modify them. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6420.42s)]
*  In 1965, which would have been two years into his new life in Newark, neighbors called the [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6423.62s)]
*  cops after a loud bang came from their apartment and the cops came and found an unexploded [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6430.3s)]
*  bomb encased in bamboo. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6435.9400000000005s)]
*  So he's arrested and charged and the landlord evicts the lot of them and DeFries jumps bail [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6438.02s)]
*  and leaves the family and flees to Southern California. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6443.14s)]
*  Three weeks later, he's arrested hitchhiking on the freeway near San Bernardino and cops [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6447.46s)]
*  find him with a briefcase holding a sawed-off shotgun and a tear gas bomb and a sharpened [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6453.04s)]
*  butter knife. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6458.78s)]
*  And so he's released again and he goes back to Newark, immediately gets arrested again, [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6459.78s)]
*  this time with another homemade bomb. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6465.5s)]
*  And so it's all very strange because people who knew him at the time say that he wasn't [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6466.98s)]
*  political at all as far as anybody could tell. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6471.44s)]
*  Nobody to this day knows what he was up to. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6473.66s)]
*  Well by now people in Newark knew to avoid him and so he couldn't get any more jobs painting [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6477.179999999999s)]
*  houses and so he convinces his wife, who apparently is a very patient woman, to take her three [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6480.82s)]
*  kids with him to Los Angeles so they can get a fresh start. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6487.46s)]
*  And she does. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6490.5s)]
*  And in Los Angeles he's painting houses again, he gets a job as a short order cook in a restaurant, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6491.5s)]
*  but at nighttime he starts buying up black market guns and selling them to street gangs [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6497.22s)]
*  for extra money. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6501.26s)]
*  And this is how he starts coming into contact with the Black Panther Party, which had just [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6502.72s)]
*  recently been formed. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6506.22s)]
*  DeFries starts drinking a lot and he and his wife continue to fight a lot and he keeps [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6508.8s)]
*  up his habit of disappearing for days at a time and getting arrested under very strange [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6513.74s)]
*  circumstances. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6518.82s)]
*  Once he's picked up for running a red light on a bicycle and in the bike's basket cops [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6519.82s)]
*  found a handgun and two bombs he made. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6525.38s)]
*  He got probation for that but then got arrested again a short time later for having an unregistered [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6528.04s)]
*  pistol which turned out to be from among 200 weapons that had been stolen from a military [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6532.719999999999s)]
*  supply depot. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6537.34s)]
*  So he tells the cops that he has the rest of the guns and he offers to show them where [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6539.72s)]
*  they're hidden in an apartment building but he'll only show them in person and so they [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6543.740000000001s)]
*  bring him there and he manages to get loose and he jumps out of a second story window [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6547.54s)]
*  and manages to escape only to get picked up again four days later after which he escorts [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6552.18s)]
*  him to the actual hiding place of the guns and for his cooperation he gets off once again [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6557.68s)]
*  with only probation, partly with the help of a sympathetic court psychologist who said [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6562.0s)]
*  he was emotionally confused and conflicted. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6568.32s)]
*  So he tries again to get back on the path, he takes of course an aircraft assembly and [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6572.5599999999995s)]
*  repair but he finds that he can't get a job in that field due to his criminal background. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6577.04s)]
*  By now his wife is demanding that they get out of Los Angeles and so he takes her and [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6582.639999999999s)]
*  the kids back to Cleveland but after just a few months there he's arrested on the roof [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6587.08s)]
*  of a bank with a burglary kit and finally his wife bails so he goes back to LA alone. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6591.599999999999s)]
*  As soon as he gets there he robs a woman of a $1,000 cashier's check but the cops are [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6597.52s)]
*  called when he tries to cash it so he runs from them on foot firing his gun wildly at [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6602.360000000001s)]
*  them until he runs out of bullets and then he surrenders. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6607.64s)]
*  And so finally Donald DeFries, this guy who had been spit out of an abusive home as a [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6611.72s)]
*  14 year old runaway and had been just a rolling disaster ever since, finally has his probation [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6618.080000000001s)]
*  pulled and was sent up for a minimum of five years. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6625.92s)]
*  Like many young black men from difficult circumstances with criminal histories back then, prison [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6631.36s)]
*  was in a way it was like the first time that Donald DeFries, like I said just a rolling [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6637.4s)]
*  disaster from the time he was a kid and this was like the first time he ever really had [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6642.66s)]
*  a moment to just stop and take a breath. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6648.78s)]
*  He began to read to pass the time, he started with porn, reading the articles while he recharged [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6653.02s)]
*  his batteries then moved on to other magazines and then books. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6658.700000000001s)]
*  He started paying attention to the prisoners talking about black power and black liberation. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6663.26s)]
*  One of them gave him a book, Soledad Brother by George Jackson and he read it and that [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6669.06s)]
*  was when everything clicked into place for Donald DeFries. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6674.18s)]
*  DeFries was suddenly able to understand his strange jumble of a life. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6679.26s)]
*  None of it, he discovered, was really his fault. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6686.9400000000005s)]
*  The black man never had a chance, he never had a chance. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6689.780000000001s)]
*  Moreover, he wasn't really a criminal. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6693.62s)]
*  He had been fighting for his economic freedom, for his dignity, and a repressive white government [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6696.26s)]
*  had jailed him for it. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6701.04s)]
*  He was a political prisoner. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6702.780000000001s)]
*  In time, DeFries branched out, reading the books Jackson recommended, Mao, Lenin, Che, [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6704.86s)]
*  then Fanon and de Breu and the rest. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6711.0599999999995s)]
*  And while he never became entirely conversant in left-wing ideology, he found adventure [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6713.66s)]
*  and excitement and purpose. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6717.54s)]
*  Marxism even explained his wife. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6719.7s)]
*  She wasn't a striving harpy, she was just bourgeois. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6722.219999999999s)]
*  And so DeFries, he's all in, he gets into this fully. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6728.5s)]
*  He starts attending meetings with the prison's Black Culture Association twice a week in [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6732.94s)]
*  the prison library where they would organize classes in black history and literature and [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6737.78s)]
*  bring in guest speakers from the outside or watch films on African history and culture. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6743.259999999999s)]
*  And the meetings would often be led by white radicals from the outside who would come in [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6749.58s)]
*  to volunteer. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6754.219999999999s)]
*  Each meeting would begin with chanting in Swahili and a clenched fist salute to the [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6756.54s)]
*  flag of the BLA and all the members of the Black Culture Association took on African [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6760.54s)]
*  sounding names. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6765.22s)]
*  That was a big thing back then. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6766.22s)]
*  And so Donald DeFries starts going by Cinque Mtoome. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6767.58s)]
*  The inmates spent most of their meetings fantasizing about escape and planning the future revolution. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6772.54s)]
*  One of the radical white tutors who were coming in to lead some of the meetings remembered [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6778.86s)]
*  how quote, there were inmates at Vacaville who had mapped out the revolution from beginning [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6783.86s)]
*  to end, leaving out nothing in between. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6788.66s)]
*  They knew what time the revolution would start in the morning and what day. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6791.22s)]
*  They knew how to form a vanguard and how it would split up into cadres from the east and [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6795.0199999999995s)]
*  the west and the north and the south. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6798.82s)]
*  To hear them talk, you would think that they knew exactly how to do away with the system. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6800.54s)]
*  The guards would hear they shit 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6804.34s)]
*  There were people who could quote long passages from Che and Mao and Marx and revolutionaries [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6808.08s)]
*  that I never heard of. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6812.5s)]
*  DeFries becomes the model of a prison revolutionary and develops relationships with many of these [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6815.9s)]
*  white radicals who were visiting the black prisoners looking for the next Eldridge Cleaver, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6822.0599999999995s)]
*  George Jackson. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6827.179999999999s)]
*  Many of the visitors were from a group of Bay Area radicals who called themselves Venso [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6829.82s)]
*  Ramos. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6834.32s)]
*  And they had only started operating in 1969, but they didn't last long. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6835.32s)]
*  They didn't start out violent, but pretty soon one of the female members of Venso Ramos [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6839.58s)]
*  fell in love with a black inmate that they were visiting named Ronald Beatty and convinced [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6844.86s)]
*  her comrades to help break him out of prison so that he could lead them up into the Sierra [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6849.34s)]
*  Nevada mountains where they would set up training camps and begin the revolution. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6853.66s)]
*  It was not a complicated plan. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6858.7s)]
*  Beatty was being transferred and several Venso Ramos cadres ran up, shot two of the guards [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6860.66s)]
*  at point blank range, killed one of them and got away with Beatty. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6865.62s)]
*  But he was recaptured soon afterwards and he gave up the whole Venso Ramos organization. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6869.82s)]
*  He told the cops that he had just been telling these people what they wanted to hear so they'd [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6875.46s)]
*  help get him out of jail and that he'd been playing the woman for the same reason. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6878.58s)]
*  And so that was the end of Venso Ramos. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6883.179999999999s)]
*  And that came right around the same time that Donald DeFries managed to break himself out [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6885.54s)]
*  of prison, this time successfully. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6889.92s)]
*  He had been transferred to Soledad, George Jackson's old lockup, and put on a work crew [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6893.66s)]
*  as a boiler attendant. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6897.94s)]
*  So just after midnight, one night in March 1973, he's dropped off at the fence line near [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6899.219999999999s)]
*  some boilers he was supposed to see to and the guard drove off, he's supposed to check [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6906.58s)]
*  on him every half hour, and DeFries just climbs over the 12 foot fence, tears his jeans on [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6910.179999999999s)]
*  the barbed wire, but takes off, gets away. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6915.34s)]
*  So DeFries by this point had been out of touch with his friends from Venso Ramos since being [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6918.94s)]
*  transferred to Soledad. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6922.9s)]
*  So he didn't know that the organization had come apart and so he starts making his way [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6924.5s)]
*  up to Berkeley to round him up. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6928.06s)]
*  He's hitchhiking up the 101, he manages to get somebody to lend him a telephone, and [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6930.9s)]
*  he gets in touch with somebody that he knows who drives down with a change of clothes and [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6935.14s)]
*  picks him up to bring him up north. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6938.9s)]
*  And on the drive up, DeFries explains to him that with George Jackson gone, Jackson had [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6941.1s)]
*  been killed by now, the revolution needed a new leader and so that's why he had to break [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6945.5s)]
*  himself out of prison. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6951.02s)]
*  He gets dropped off at a commune in Berkeley and as crazy as DeFries is, you know, he had [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6953.82s)]
*  a way about him. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6959.66s)]
*  This is from Burrow, quote, when the door opened, DeFries's first words were, look [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6960.66s)]
*  here, you know, I'm here, let's start the revolution. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6966.34s)]
*  A friend of a friend allowed DeFries to sleep in her apartment that first night. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6970.9s)]
*  It was on the second night that Donald DeFries, soon to anoint himself General Field Marshal [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6975.099999999999s)]
*  of the Symbionese Liberation Army found his way into the bed of his first recruit, an [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6980.42s)]
*  attractive 22 year old pharmacist daughter named Patricia Soltisic. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6985.139999999999s)]
*  Her family called her Pat. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6989.82s)]
*  She preferred Ms. Moon. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6991.599999999999s)]
*  She was a sometime Berkeley student, a sometime lesbian, and a self avowed revolutionary feminist. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6993.7s)]
*  She was also a janitor. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=6999.86s)]
*  When she wasn't mopping floors, Soltisic would become DeFries's partner in a revolutionary [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7001.679999999999s)]
*  assault on America. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7005.98s)]
*  In those early days, when no one was looking that hard for DeFries, the two were free to [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7008.02s)]
*  drift through the bizarre, bizarre that was 1973 Berkeley, a college town deep in a post-1960s [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7012.18s)]
*  intellectual hangover, a haven for aging radicals who could still talk eagerly about the coming [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7018.38s)]
*  revolution but no longer had the energy to do much about it. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7023.9800000000005s)]
*  Berkeley's free speech movement had helped launch the movement in 1964, but its best [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7028.26s)]
*  and brightest had long since moved on to other causes. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7032.780000000001s)]
*  In their absence, the calls for revolution had fallen to the wayward souls who still [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7036.18s)]
*  flocked to Berkeley from across the country, the street preachers, the deluded, the lost. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7040.4400000000005s)]
*  The Bay Area left remained as vital as ever, still teeming with radicals devoted to every [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7046.62s)]
*  conceivable cause, but those who clung to the idea of armed struggle and the viability [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7050.900000000001s)]
*  of an underground now ran less to the brainy Ivy Leaguers of the weather underground than [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7055.96s)]
*  to the escaped convicts, janitors, runaways, and angry lesbians who would eventually, under [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7061.78s)]
*  DeFries' leadership, become the Symbionese Liberation Army. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7066.58s)]
*  America had changed that much in three short years. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7071.3s)]
*  In 1970, those who called for violent revolution were viewed by many as an intellectual vanguard. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7074.98s)]
*  In 1973, they were widely dismissed as lunatics." [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7081.219999999999s)]
*  1973, which incidentally, if you remember from the previous episode, is the year that [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7086.02s)]
*  Jim Jones really tipped over and started to lose his marbles, it's often called the real [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7094.3s)]
*  end of the 1960s. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7104.02s)]
*  I guess technically December 31st, 1969 is that, but 73 is really often looked at as [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7106.42s)]
*  the real end of that era. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7114.1s)]
*  Nixon's blowout victory in November the year before was followed shortly after by the announcement [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7116.700000000001s)]
*  of our withdrawal from Vietnam, and for the first time in several years, the forces of [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7122.5s)]
*  reaction seemed to have more energy than the forces of revolution and more focus. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7128.34s)]
*  The country as a whole seemed to be waking up from something. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7134.34s)]
*  Many people felt like we had survived a brush with madness. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7142.0199999999995s)]
*  People were looking back and trying to figure out what had happened. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7149.0199999999995s)]
*  It was a theme that came through even in pop culture. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7152.58s)]
*  One of the big movies of the year, 1973, was George Lucas' Nostalgia Fest about being a [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7155.86s)]
*  kid in the 1950s, American graffiti. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7161.54s)]
*  Before the counterculture, before the movement, before the protests and the burning buildings [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7164.86s)]
*  and the war in Vietnam, Lucas was very direct about what it was he was trying to accomplish. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7169.26s)]
*  He was a counterculture director at first. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7175.02s)]
*  Part of that new director set with Dennis Hopper and Francis Ford Coppola and everything, [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7177.7s)]
*  but you can tell from this movie and from the rest that he really went in another direction. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7182.9800000000005s)]
*  He describes why, he's very direct, quote, we all know, as every movie in the last 10 [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7186.900000000001s)]
*  years has pointed out, how terrible we are, how wrong we were in Vietnam, how we've ruined [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7192.02s)]
*  the world, what schmucks we are and how rotten everything is. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7196.46s)]
*  It had become depressing to go to the movies. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7199.22s)]
*  I decided it was time to make a movie where people felt better coming out of the theater [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7202.06s)]
*  than when they went in. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7205.46s)]
*  I became really aware of the fact that the kids were really lost. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7206.94s)]
*  The sort of heritage we built up since the war had been wiped out by the 60s and it wasn't [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7210.62s)]
*  so groovy to act that way anymore. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7215.06s)]
*  Now you just sort of sat there and got stoned. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7217.3s)]
*  I wanted to preserve what a certain generation of Americans thought being a teenager was [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7220.14s)]
*  really about from about 1945 to 1962, end quote. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7223.72s)]
*  This is a trope now that we're all very familiar with, but this movie kind of kicked that off. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7230.52s)]
*  It kicked off a 50s craze that lasted throughout the rest of the 70s and continued in various [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7234.88s)]
*  ways even later. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7240.04s)]
*  That show Happy Days began its run a year later in 1974. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7242.12s)]
*  People loved the 50s in the 1970s. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7250.0s)]
*  They wanted to forget the 60s, the bad parts and complicated parts anyway. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7252.48s)]
*  People looked back at what happened and in some corners in different ways was still happening. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7257.44s)]
*  Trying to figure out just what it was that had been going on, one of the emerging explanations [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7265.4s)]
*  that was becoming popular, people were coming up with was that the culture had been hijacked [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7271.48s)]
*  and the youth had been brainwashed. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7276.24s)]
*  They really meant that. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7278.0s)]
*  Repatriation was a big theme, whether it was the drugs or the media or communist influence, [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7281.44s)]
*  whatever it was, some people began thinking of the recent years as a kind of collective [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7286.0s)]
*  madness. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7291.08s)]
*  As the war wound down in the spring of 73, hundreds of POWs started coming back from [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7294.24s)]
*  Vietnam and their repatriation was turned into a media spectacle and it really became [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7300.0s)]
*  a, it was a big matter of public focus. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7305.0s)]
*  The Nixon administration kind of made it that way. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7308.16s)]
*  They wanted to use the returning POWs to try to salvage some kind of a happy narrative [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7310.2s)]
*  out of the war's end. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7314.88s)]
*  But there were hundreds of these guys and they came in all flavors and some of them [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7316.68s)]
*  came back spouting anti-war rhetoric and denouncing Nixon, denouncing the US military, denouncing [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7320.88s)]
*  the war. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7327.0s)]
*  Some of them even said that they'd become communists. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7328.0s)]
*  The military officers who had been put out front by the Pentagon to be the public face [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7331.5199999999995s)]
*  of the POWs, these were all officers who had gone to the academy. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7336.04s)]
*  Many of them were pilots who had been kept up at the Hanoi Hilton, tortured brutally. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7340.400000000001s)]
*  Guys like John McCain, for example, they reacted very negatively to seeing these other POWs [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7345.64s)]
*  taking the side of the Vietnamese and so they accused the dissidents of collaborating with [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7353.12s)]
*  the enemy and echoing the aftermath of Korea. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7357.4400000000005s)]
*  They accused them of being brainwashed by the Vietnamese. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7360.56s)]
*  This is a very different country in 1973 than it was in the early 50s after Korea, obviously, [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7364.92s)]
*  and so the dissidents didn't back down. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7369.76s)]
*  They accused the gung-ho officers of having been brainwashed. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7372.32s)]
*  They said they were brainwashed by the US military into mindless obedience. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7375.599999999999s)]
*  They said far from being brainwashed, the Vietnamese had just freed them from the hate [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7381.32s)]
*  programming that they'd been subjected to in boot camp and in military training. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7385.74s)]
*  It just went back and forth and these two groups, the different groups of POWs kind [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7389.8s)]
*  of got taken up into the culture war that had already been going on while these people [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7394.200000000001s)]
*  were away. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7399.04s)]
*  You have to imagine, there were POWs who had been captured in 1964, pilots who had been [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7400.04s)]
*  shot down in 1964 and they got released in the spring of 1973. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7408.6s)]
*  You just try to imagine what they missed. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7415.64s)]
*  I mean, goodness gracious, the 60s hadn't really even gotten started in 64, what we [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7417.84s)]
*  think of as the 60s. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7423.4400000000005s)]
*  You come back in 1973 when it's basically all over and I can hardly think of a period [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7426.400000000001s)]
*  of time in US history where if you missed that number of years, it would be harder to [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7434.52s)]
*  explain to you what had gone on. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7438.96s)]
*  Even the Civil War or something like that. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7442.8s)]
*  If you went to sleep Rip Van Winkle style in 1855 or 1856 and woke up in 1865, I guess [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7445.24s)]
*  Civil War is a big deal but I could explain to you what happened. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7457.2s)]
*  The whole slavery issue, the North and the South were arguing about the Western states [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7460.24s)]
*  and what was going to happen. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7463.96s)]
*  Well, finally came to a head, the South tried to secede, North said no, we had a fight, [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7464.96s)]
*  now it's over. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7469.360000000001s)]
*  Try to explain the differences in culture to somebody who'd be gone since 64, it was [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7470.92s)]
*  a huge shock. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7476.4s)]
*  Anyway, the whole thing got very ugly, the dispute, like everything was ugly in the early [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7477.96s)]
*  1970s. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7483.679999999999s)]
*  That wasn't all. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7484.679999999999s)]
*  At the same time that this is going on and you've got two groups of POWs and their supporters [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7487.0s)]
*  each accusing the other of having been brainwashed, the country is caught up in a panic over [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7494.04s)]
*  cults. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7499.599999999999s)]
*  In the early 1970s, the Reverend Some Young Moon brought his Holy Spirit Association for [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7500.599999999999s)]
*  the Unification of World Christianity, which is better known as the Unification Church [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7506.719999999999s)]
*  to the United States. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7511.759999999999s)]
*  In 1973, he embarked on a 21 city speaking tour filling up Yankee Stadium, Madison Square [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7513.639999999999s)]
*  Garden, wraps up at Carnegie Hall. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7519.36s)]
*  A couple years later, he speaks to over 300,000 people at the Washington Monument. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7521.759999999999s)]
*  If you weren't a part of that, 300,000 is a lot of people, but most people obviously [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7526.72s)]
*  weren't a part of it, it's all very strange, especially considering that it is far, far, [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7531.360000000001s)]
*  far from the only heterodox new religious movement in town. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7536.92s)]
*  There's an explosion of cults in the early 1970s, especially on the West Coast. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7540.240000000001s)]
*  With so many new religions cropping up and pulling in young people by the thousands, [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7546.6s)]
*  just as their parents were sighing with relief that the 60s political madness was coming [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7552.4s)]
*  to an end, an anti-cult movement got started to counter the cults. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7556.96s)]
*  If the anti-cult movement was not as fanatical or dogmatic as the cults it opposed, it was [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7566.24s)]
*  pretty close in a lot of ways, because it wasn't just a movement dedicated to identifying [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7571.28s)]
*  and monitoring groups that it considered cults. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7576.44s)]
*  It came with a full package of concepts and beliefs about what cults were and how they [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7578.96s)]
*  worked, and they especially focused on the idea of brainwashing. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7584.24s)]
*  I told you this was a theme in 1973. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7588.84s)]
*  When you say brainwashing, you think, well, what is brainwashing? [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7594.44s)]
*  They meant it in a very literal way. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7598.68s)]
*  The idea of brainwashing had emerged after the Korean War, when Americans were trying [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7601.76s)]
*  to come up with an explanation for how so many American POWs, the heroic GIs who had [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7608.62s)]
*  just defeated Hitler and Tojo, held such an honored place in America's collective identity [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7614.38s)]
*  in the 1950s, how so many of them could have succumbed to coercion or inducement to collaborate [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7619.74s)]
*  with the enemy, because many of them made videos or signed statements denouncing the [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7625.9s)]
*  war, denouncing the American effort. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7630.62s)]
*  The answer people came up with was brainwashing, sophisticated communist brainwashing techniques [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7633.62s)]
*  that bypassed the rational mind and thus rendered the patriotism and the courage of the POWs [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7640.3s)]
*  irrelevant. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7647.3s)]
*  It seized control of them through unconscious manipulation. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7648.3s)]
*  People again took the idea very literally. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7652.7s)]
*  The movie The Manchurian Candidate, which was released in 1962, it sort of helped firm [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7654.76s)]
*  up the public's idea about brainwashing and what it was to a degree, but mostly it was [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7660.54s)]
*  just portraying the process the way people already more or less understood it. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7664.62s)]
*  And I don't just mean unsophisticated moviegoers. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7669.46s)]
*  At the time, the CIA was apparently engaged in experimental attempts to do the same thing [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7671.78s)]
*  under the MKUltra program. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7676.18s)]
*  A few years later, Israeli intelligence turned a Palestinian prisoner over to a psychiatrist [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7679.3s)]
*  to claim that he could use hypnosis and other brainwashing techniques to turn the man into [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7686.0599999999995s)]
*  a robotic killer that they would then return to the PLO to assassinate Yasser Arafat. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7690.5s)]
*  This is really how people thought that it worked. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7695.259999999999s)]
*  They tried that. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7697.62s)]
*  They did this with this guy and they released him thinking it was going to work, but it [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7698.78s)]
*  didn't work. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7703.0599999999995s)]
*  He went back to the PLO and told them all about it. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7704.0599999999995s)]
*  They really believed this is how brainwashing worked. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7706.58s)]
*  So they thought that this was real, that this could happen to an individual. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7710.82s)]
*  When you brought mass media into it, people were very concerned about the effects of mass [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7714.74s)]
*  media. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7719.38s)]
*  You remember the baby boomers, the protest generation, or the first generation to grow [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7720.38s)]
*  up with TVs in the house. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7724.38s)]
*  It shaped the way many Americans interpreted the rise of the 60s counterculture and then [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7727.66s)]
*  these 70s cults. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7732.34s)]
*  It was a form of mass brainwashing. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7734.54s)]
*  These two phenomena which, like the Korean War POW scandal, involved people behaving [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7737.82s)]
*  in ways that mainstream normies couldn't explain in terms of rational motivations that [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7744.38s)]
*  made any kind of sense in their view of the world. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7749.66s)]
*  One of the anti-cult movements' most famous activists, this guy named Ted Patrick, he [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7755.3s)]
*  told an interviewer, there's an energy from the brainwaves that comes down through the [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7759.9800000000005s)]
*  eyes. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7764.18s)]
*  This is what ESP is. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7765.18s)]
*  They're teaching this in all the universities. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7766.74s)]
*  This is the anti-cult movement saying this. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7770.18s)]
*  Ted Patrick was a self-described deprogrammer who had become a legend in the anti-cult movement [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7773.42s)]
*  after his son was approached by the Children of God, which was a Southern California movement [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7779.62s)]
*  that actually had the families of Joaquin Phoenix and Rose McGowan as members at one [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7784.22s)]
*  point. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7789.06s)]
*  Well, by 1973, Ted Patrick told Newsweek that he had conducted over 600 cult member interventions [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7790.06s)]
*  across the country. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7798.22s)]
*  Patrick was an unassuming, very ordinary looking black man, but his methods were not [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7800.18s)]
*  ordinary and he got the nickname in the movement, Black Lightning. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7804.780000000001s)]
*  The way it worked was a friend or a relative, usually a parent of a cult member, would come [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7808.780000000001s)]
*  to Patrick for help and he would arrange to take the member away to an isolated location, [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7815.860000000001s)]
*  usually a home or a motel room, keeping them there for days. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7821.38s)]
*  He would force them, you know, do whatever he had to do, keep them there for days, sometimes [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7826.14s)]
*  longer, however long it took for his psychological and emotional bombardment to break them. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7829.74s)]
*  This is a word that he used. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7836.139999999999s)]
*  And they would be forced to admit the inconsistencies of their beliefs and recognize the pain that [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7838.38s)]
*  they were causing their loved ones and, you know, denounce the cult. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7843.0599999999995s)]
*  Ted Patrick and his supporters in the anti-cult movement, they would describe the process [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7848.219999999999s)]
*  as deprogramming or defreaking or simply as breaking the cult member. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7852.26s)]
*  And Patrick became famous in January 1973 when he was arrested and charged with assault [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7858.459999999999s)]
*  and unlawful imprisonment for attempting to force a 20-year-old Yale student and cult [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7864.78s)]
*  member into a car. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7869.0599999999995s)]
*  Some cops saw him when the guy started yelling and Patrick was arrested and charged. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7870.7s)]
*  He decided to fight the charges and he used the media attention on the case to feed into [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7876.379999999999s)]
*  a growing national hysteria about cults and it became a huge story. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7881.86s)]
*  I mean, the whole country was paying attention to it. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7886.38s)]
*  He told one reporter, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7889.1s)]
*  Well, the trial turned into a referendum on the limits of religious freedom and the prosecution, [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7904.82s)]
*  accused Patrick of employing the very brainwashing techniques that he claimed to be against. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7911.9s)]
*  And of course, Patrick said he was not brainwashing anybody. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7916.78s)]
*  He's freeing people from brainwashing. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7919.46s)]
*  And the prosecution pointed out that's exactly what the so-called cults claim to be doing. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7922.139999999999s)]
*  But in the end, Patrick was found not guilty. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7926.7s)]
*  And so people were following this cult scare and this story, this Ted Patrick story in [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7930.74s)]
*  the media in 1973 with all the talk about brainwashing. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7935.7s)]
*  At the same time that they're watching the POWs go back and forth, creating accusations [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7939.92s)]
*  of brainwashing, they would literally see segments about both stories on the same episode [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7944.66s)]
*  of the evening news. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7950.12s)]
*  And then one of the bestselling books of 1973 was called Sybil, which was a supposedly true [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7953.04s)]
*  story about a woman with dissociative disorder and 16 different personalities living inside [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7958.72s)]
*  each of which could take over without her consent or control, which is not exactly brainwashing. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7965.12s)]
*  But you know, you got someone's mind being hijacked by forces that they can't control. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7971.72s)]
*  And so you see this theme everywhere. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7976.12s)]
*  You know, they see it on the news, they're buying bestselling books about it, and they're [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7978.12s)]
*  going to the movies to watch it. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7983.2s)]
*  One of the biggest movies released in 1973 was The Exorcist, which obviously carried [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7986.08s)]
*  many of the same themes. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7990.88s)]
*  Young girl with an absentee father and a self-involved mother becomes possessed by a demon. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7993.2s)]
*  You know, okay, it's a pretty unsubtle horror flick, but if you go one layer deep, it's [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=7998.2s)]
*  got generational rebellion, something like brainwashing, you know, even a kind of hostage [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8002.32s)]
*  taking, you know, and it really, well, you know, young people away from their parents [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8008.36s)]
*  having their minds hijacked by demonic forces is a good summary of how many people were [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8016.36s)]
*  now beginning to think of the late 1960s. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8020.4s)]
*  Another movie from that year that has stood the test of time is Badlands by Terrence Malick. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8025.0s)]
*  Very different from The Exorcist, but it plays on similar themes in very different ways, [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8031.599999999999s)]
*  obviously, if you've seen the movie. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8036.759999999999s)]
*  You know, this one, Badlands, is sort of a takeoff on the Bonnie and Clyde theme. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8038.4s)]
*  And it begins when the Clyde figure, played by Martin Sheen, kills Bonnie's father, burns [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8043.92s)]
*  down her family home, and the two of them run off together on a crime spree. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8048.4s)]
*  Martin Sheen's Clyde character is consciously modeling himself after James Dean. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8054.04s)]
*  He worships James Dean, you know, the original rebel without a cause, and the two sort of [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8059.08s)]
*  recapitulate the Bonnie and Clyde characters in this, kind of recapitulate the youth rebellion [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8064.5199999999995s)]
*  of the 60s. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8070.799999999999s)]
*  You know, they kill the symbolic father and burn down the house to sever ties with the [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8071.799999999999s)]
*  past, and yet the two lovers, nevertheless, save some knickknacks from the fire and spend [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8075.52s)]
*  the rest of the film trying to play house by recreating the traditional family environment [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8082.0s)]
*  that they've destroyed. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8086.56s)]
*  But, of course, they can never quite do it. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8087.56s)]
*  And, you know, it reminds me of a quote I saw somewhere from Santayana, that the misfortune [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8090.320000000001s)]
*  of revolutionaries is that they've been disinherited, having cut themselves off from heritage and [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8094.96s)]
*  tradition, and that the folly of the revolutionary is that they wish to be disinherited even [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8100.200000000001s)]
*  more. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8105.32s)]
*  What's interesting is that The Badlands and The Exorcist, which are such totally different [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8106.32s)]
*  films, they both center around a young girl who's been taken over by a dark force, and [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8111.719999999999s)]
*  both contain the subtext that moving her father out of the picture was the prerequisite for [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8118.48s)]
*  that to happen. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8123.0s)]
*  Once she was possessed, whether by the demon or the criminal maniac, or the implication [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8125.5599999999995s)]
*  by the cult leaders or wannabe revolutionaries who had led so many daughters down a bad road [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8132.0s)]
*  in recent years, once that happened, daddy's little girl was capable of just about anything. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8138.320000000001s)]
*  1973 was also the year of the Roe vs. Wade abortion decision, and so when people went [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8145.320000000001s)]
*  to the movies and saw The Exorcist, you know, the decision to include the scene of the demon-possessed [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8151.4400000000005s)]
*  young girl jabbing a crucifix into her vagina, that was not without ideological content, [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8157.4s)]
*  nor was the story's conclusion that only the arrival on scene of a traditional father, [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8164.12s)]
*  a priest no less, in place of the absentee father could save the girl. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8169.92s)]
*  And so people, society wrestles with things that it's dealing with unconsciously through [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8176.5199999999995s)]
*  pop culture, I really believe that. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8184.0s)]
*  Each of these films deals with the question of the girl's agency very differently. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8187.2s)]
*  The Exorcist, again, is not a subtle film and leaves no room for ambiguity. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8192.96s)]
*  The girl has been held and tortured against her will. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8197.72s)]
*  It's her doing and saying these things, technically it's her body, but the film takes the position [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8201.24s)]
*  basically of the anti-cult activist with brainwashing. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8206.2s)]
*  Her consciousness has been pushed aside by a superior and more sophisticated force, and [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8209.68s)]
*  she has become just a bystander to her own destruction. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8215.72s)]
*  There's that scene where the wound comes up on her arm that says, help me, like she's [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8219.039999999999s)]
*  in there watching this happen to herself. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8223.76s)]
*  Badlands is a more complex film, and throughout the story you're left with the questions over [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8227.279999999999s)]
*  the girl's complicity. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8235.119999999999s)]
*  Her lover, the Clyde character, he commits the actual murders and generally pulls her [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8237.6s)]
*  along, but she's also in love with him. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8243.76s)]
*  This man who murdered her father and burned down her house. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8247.84s)]
*  She goes along willingly, although of course it's an open question how much free will a [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8252.28s)]
*  girl can exercise when she's traveling with a homicidal maniac. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8258.08s)]
*  Malick had been making the film for some time, obviously, it takes a while to make a movie, [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8263.32s)]
*  so it was just a coincidence that in the summer of 1973, again I told you this is a theme [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8266.960000000001s)]
*  this year, was when we got the term Stockholm Syndrome from a bank heist turned hostage [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8272.560000000001s)]
*  situation in Sweden that ended when the terrorized hostages ended up siding with their captors [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8278.960000000001s)]
*  and refused to testify against them. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8284.52s)]
*  And Stockholm Syndrome again, it's a kind of brainwashing. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8286.640000000001s)]
*  You're sort of asking some of the same questions. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8292.84s)]
*  And neither could Malick have known that at that very moment the world's most famous [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8297.08s)]
*  example of Stockholm Syndrome to this day probably even more famous than the event that [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8302.039999999999s)]
*  gave us the term was about to happen. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8306.72s)]
*  It was an event that would combine all of these questions and debates about brainwashing [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8310.24s)]
*  and about your daughters and young people being let off by mad men and the question [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8317.52s)]
*  of their agency and it would bring the whole question of the 60s and its legacy to a head. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8324.720000000001s)]
*  And it brings us back to the occasional guest of People's Temple, according to testimony [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8329.720000000001s)]
*  later provided to police, Donald DeFries, aka General Field Marshal Sinke and his Simeonese [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8335.76s)]
*  Liberation Army. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8343.880000000001s)]
*  Now DeFries and his companion, Ms. Moon, had gathered up a handful of followers from the [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8346.68s)]
*  the Berkeley underground, most of them leftovers from Vance Aramos that he had known from prison. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8351.72s)]
*  There were four men, four women, in addition to DeFries and Ms. Moon. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8356.72s)]
*  All of them were white. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8361.76s)]
*  DeFries himself was the only African American. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8362.76s)]
*  Now DeFries, General Field Marshal of the Simeonese Liberation Army, obviously was possessed [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8366.28s)]
*  of some delusions of grandeur and spread that mania to the rest of the group. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8372.4s)]
*  He huddled in a hideout, spent weeks drawing up org charts and bylaws and plans for a Simeonese [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8378.02s)]
*  Federated Republic and the Court of the People came up with plans for logistics and medical [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8383.7s)]
*  and communications branches. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8388.62s)]
*  They created a bunch of documents stating their goals. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8392.140000000001s)]
*  They wanted to abolish prisons and the institution of marriage as well as rent and to wage war [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8394.66s)]
*  against racism, sexism, ageism, capitalism, fascism, individualism, possessiveness, competitiveness [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8401.02s)]
*  and all other institutions that have made and sustained capitalism. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8406.94s)]
*  And the group in many ways followed the established revolutionary playbook. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8412.060000000001s)]
*  They had daily calisthenics and karate lessons, mandatory Marxist study groups, time at the [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8415.820000000002s)]
*  firing range and of course endless struggle sessions. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8421.380000000001s)]
*  And since everybody except for DeFries was white, they spent time in mandatory classes [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8425.980000000001s)]
*  practicing how to speak like the black proletariat as they envisioned it, which mostly consisted [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8430.820000000002s)]
*  of learning to use double negatives as a habit and to inject the word pig anytime [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8435.86s)]
*  they spoke about police or the military or the government or system in general. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8440.1s)]
*  When they began releasing demands and revolutionary communiques, the most common salutation that [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8447.1s)]
*  they would use was in all caps, death to the fascist insect that preys upon the life of [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8452.18s)]
*  the people. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8457.66s)]
*  As their symbol, they adopted the seven headed cobra, which they said symbolized God and [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8460.140000000001s)]
*  life and had a history going back 170,000 years. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8465.1s)]
*  And it's not certain but possible that they were inspired by a 1973 movie called The Spook [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8470.42s)]
*  Who Sat by the Door or the 69 book of the same name. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8476.42s)]
*  It's about a black Korean war veteran who's hired into the CIA because of imposed racial [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8480.74s)]
*  quotas and he uses the time to learn assassination and spycraft. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8485.300000000001s)]
*  And when he's got the knowledge that he needs, he quits and heads back to Chicago and uses [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8489.82s)]
*  his skills that he learned in the CIA to organize a black uprising. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8494.24s)]
*  And he calls his organization the Cobras and the book, which I haven't read, the movie's [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8498.56s)]
*  pretty wild, somewhere uses the term symbiology apparently. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8504.16s)]
*  So some people think that this is where they were inspired. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8508.52s)]
*  And the story ends when the uprising occurs and the president of the United States declares [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8511.72s)]
*  a state of emergency. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8516.92s)]
*  Well the revolutionary career of the SLA started out less spectacularly than that of [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8519.24s)]
*  the Cobras. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8524.28s)]
*  As their first revolutionary action, DeFries decided that they were going to assassinate [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8525.28s)]
*  the first black superintendent of Oakland schools, a guy named Marcus Foster. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8531.36s)]
*  And so on November 6, 1973, DeFries and two of his female followers ambushed Foster as [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8537.16s)]
*  he was leaving work and they murdered him and also shot up his best friend who happened [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8543.4s)]
*  to be with him. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8548.04s)]
*  And police would later discover that the tips of the bullets had been drilled out and filled [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8549.960000000001s)]
*  with potassium cyanide. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8553.460000000001s)]
*  But to the dismay of DeFries and the SLA, the assassination did not have the desired [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8555.6s)]
*  effect. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8562.52s)]
*  Rather than being inspired to rise up, the murder of Marcus Foster was universally condemned, [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8563.76s)]
*  even by Berkeley's most militant parts of the radical left. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8569.12s)]
*  Black leaders denounced them. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8575.34s)]
*  Nobody knew who did it right away, but they denounced the killers. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8577.54s)]
*  Even the Black Panthers put out a statement against the brutal and senseless murder and [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8580.94s)]
*  suggested that it had been a provocation by secret fascist elements. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8585.14s)]
*  The day after the killing, an Oakland radio station received a communique topped by a [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8589.92s)]
*  seven-headed Cobra which informed the world that Foster had died because he had initiated [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8594.54s)]
*  a fascist program to require students to carry ID cards on campus because non-students had [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8599.02s)]
*  been disrupting campus and classes during school hours. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8604.9s)]
*  In vain, the SLA called on others to follow suit. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8609.539999999999s)]
*  They said, to those who would bear the hopes and future of our people, let the voice of [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8612.779999999999s)]
*  their guns express the words of freedom. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8617.06s)]
*  But nobody really paid the attention. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8621.18s)]
*  The Bay Area was used to this kind of thing by now, and nobody had ever heard of the SLA. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8623.82s)]
*  Even among the remaining revolutionaries, nobody was surprised, surprised. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8629.38s)]
*  Nobody was actually cool with assassinating a popular Black leader. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8634.32s)]
*  Even Bernadine Dorn released a statement clarifying Weather's position. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8638.56s)]
*  We do not comprehend the execution of Marcus Foster and respond very soberly to the death [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8642.08s)]
*  of a Black person who is not recognized as an enemy of the people. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8647.619999999999s)]
*  But still, the Oakland Stool District actually buckled to the SLA's demand and suspended [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8651.56s)]
*  the student ID program. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8657.94s)]
*  And so as far as DeFries was concerned, he was right, and the rest of the left was wrong [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8660.66s)]
*  about the SLA's tactics. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8665.74s)]
*  He moved his group into a suburban house north of Berkeley where they exercised and took [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8668.58s)]
*  their classes and wrote up a bunch of communiques for bombings that they planned to carry out [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8673.84s)]
*  against several multinational corporations as well as assassinations of several of their [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8678.88s)]
*  executives. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8683.08s)]
*  They nailed the shutters down and stapled the curtains to the walls so there was no [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8684.98s)]
*  chance anyone would see inside. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8688.02s)]
*  In early January 1974, two of the SLA men got lost driving around the neighborhood and [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8690.46s)]
*  pulled over by police. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8697.019999999999s)]
*  Cops noticed a gun and after a brief shootout and chase, the men gave up. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8698.9s)]
*  And so the others caught wind of this and they knew that it was only a matter of time [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8703.46s)]
*  before the police found their hideout. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8706.8s)]
*  So DeFries ordered the whole place drenched with gasoline and gunpowder and they lit a [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8708.48s)]
*  fuse and got out. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8712.58s)]
*  It turned out there wasn't enough oxygen in the sealed up house for it to blow so there [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8714.759999999998s)]
*  was only a fire and it was very easily put out after the cops arrived. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8718.22s)]
*  And so inside they found bombs and thousands and thousands of written pages detailing the [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8722.26s)]
*  SLA's plans. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8727.699999999999s)]
*  The cops picked through the paperwork for information on the culprits but it was a [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8730.46s)]
*  lot to pick through and apparently nobody paid attention to a green spiral notebook [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8734.019999999999s)]
*  written by SLA member Nancy Perry which later when it was all over the researchers going [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8738.779999999999s)]
*  the evidence would realize the importance of the first item of significance that she [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8745.320000000002s)]
*  listed, that daughter of Hearst. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8749.800000000001s)]
*  In the evening on February 4th, 1974, Patty Hearst was cleaning her kitchen when she and [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8754.960000000001s)]
*  her boyfriend heard a knock at the door. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8762.36s)]
*  Her boyfriend answered and Donald DeFries and two of his SLA comrades burst into the [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8765.7s)]
*  apartment, two of them driving the boyfriend to the ground while the third rushed Patty [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8770.240000000002s)]
*  and being tackled her. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8773.62s)]
*  DeFries beat her boyfriend with a rifle butt and rushed Patty outside, shoving her down [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8775.380000000001s)]
*  the stairs and firing several rounds over the heads of some neighbors that were checking [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8780.380000000001s)]
*  on the commotion. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8783.820000000002s)]
*  They blinded and gagged Patty Hearst and threw her into the trunk of a stolen car whose owner [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8785.6s)]
*  was still tied up in the back seat. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8789.900000000001s)]
*  They sped off, stopped a little bit later, transferred Patty to another car and left [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8792.140000000001s)]
*  the owner of the first one tied up on the side of the road. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8796.380000000001s)]
*  Ten minutes later they were back in their own apartment with Patty Hearst, daughter [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8799.9s)]
*  of Randolph Hearst, owner of the global Hearst Media Empire and one of the richest and most [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8804.56s)]
*  powerful men in the world tied up in a closet. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8810.779999999999s)]
*  There was no mystery as to who had kidnapped her since the SLA left a calling card, a box [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8815.34s)]
*  of cyanide-tipped bullets in her apartment. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8819.64s)]
*  For three days there was no news. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8824.06s)]
*  Nobody knew where Patty was or if she was alive. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8827.46s)]
*  Then a Berkeley radio station received a communique from the Simeonese Liberation Army Western [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8830.3s)]
*  Regional Adult Unit written up officially as an order of the Court of the People. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8835.699999999999s)]
*  Patty was a prisoner of war, they said, a legitimate target because her father was a [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8842.5s)]
*  corporate enemy of the people. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8848.259999999998s)]
*  There was no request for ransom or any other demand except that the letter be reprinted [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8851.339999999998s)]
*  in full in newspapers and announced on radio and television. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8855.54s)]
*  Another five days go by and the station receives another communique, this one including two [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8860.7s)]
*  audio tapes, one from Donald DeFries and one of Patty Hearst. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8866.2s)]
*  She said, these people aren't just a bunch of nuts. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8871.94s)]
*  They've been really honest with me but they're perfectly willing to die for what they're [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8875.86s)]
*  doing. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8879.02s)]
*  I'm here because I'm a member of a ruling class family. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8880.02s)]
*  DeFries' tape announced the SLA's first demand. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8884.46s)]
*  The Hearst family would have one week to organize a food giveaway in Bay Area ghettos. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8887.939999999999s)]
*  They were to give a package of $70 worth of food to anyone who asked for it every Tuesday, [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8895.26s)]
*  Thursday and Saturday for the next month. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8900.699999999999s)]
*  So after some wrangling Patty's father managed to put together a giveaway of $2 million worth [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8904.46s)]
*  of food but DeFries rejected that and quickly demanded another $4 million be given away. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8909.7s)]
*  This is from Brian Burrow. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8916.380000000001s)]
*  Quote, it was a colossal and chaotic undertaking. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8917.380000000001s)]
*  Tons of donated and purchased groceries loaded onto rented trucks at a San Francisco warehouse [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8921.820000000002s)]
*  then ferried to supermarkets in black neighborhoods across the Bay Area. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8927.18s)]
*  Hundreds of people waited in lines. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8931.58s)]
*  When trucks arrived late, crowds surrounded them. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8933.5s)]
*  Fights broke out. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8936.300000000001s)]
*  In some cases, workers simply tossed bags of food out of the trucks. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8937.46s)]
*  At a distribution center in East Oakland, several people were injured after being struck [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8941.74s)]
*  by frozen turkeys. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8945.699999999999s)]
*  By day's end, at which point Hearst had hoped to deliver food to 20,000 people, maybe 9,000 [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8947.46s)]
*  got some. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8953.06s)]
*  Later distributions, eventually five in all, went more smoothly. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8954.46s)]
*  They continued through March over the protests of California conservatives whose sentiments [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8958.5s)]
*  were symbolized by Governor Ronald Reagan's memorable quip, [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8963.259999999998s)]
*  It's just too bad we can't have an epidemic of botulism. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8966.86s)]
*  End quote. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8970.26s)]
*  The Black Panthers refused to assist with the handouts. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8972.5s)]
*  They said they couldn't support kidnappings as a tactic. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8975.02s)]
*  The Weathermen and other white radicals were in a little bit more difficult position though [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8978.5s)]
*  as one Weather member explained, quote, [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8982.5s)]
*  The Patty Hearst thing was great. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8985.820000000002s)]
*  Giving out all the food, all that was great. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8987.94s)]
*  Of course, we all thought their rhetoric was ridiculous and none of us paid much attention [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8990.580000000002s)]
*  to the Marcus Foster killing, a horrible thing. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8995.06s)]
*  Frankly, everybody was confused by the SLA. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=8997.9s)]
*  It was led by this black guy, so it was hard for us to be critical. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9000.82s)]
*  It was hard to condemn it too. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9004.38s)]
*  End quote. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9006.38s)]
*  So Patty Hearst is kept blindfolded and gagged in that closet for weeks. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9009.1s)]
*  DeFries would visit her from time to time to lecture her about her privilege and tell [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9015.5s)]
*  her about the destruction that the SLA was going to unleash on the country. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9019.779999999999s)]
*  He told her that she would not be mistreated as long as she behaved, other than being bound [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9024.86s)]
*  and gagged and blindfolded in a closet for weeks, but that if she did try to escape, [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9029.699999999999s)]
*  she would be immediately executed. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9034.26s)]
*  He went on about everything under the sun, the racist class system, the prisons, the [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9037.06s)]
*  evils of privileged families like hers, on and on and on. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9041.14s)]
*  They interrogated her about her upbringing and her education and her family's assets. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9045.06s)]
*  Sometimes the others would come and speak to her. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9050.74s)]
*  They would read books to her. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9052.22s)]
*  They'd read Mao to her, talk to her about the oppression and injustice of the system. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9053.42s)]
*  Patty had never been into politics at all, but as a survival tactic, she began to talk [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9058.539999999999s)]
*  back, just agree with whatever they said. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9063.859999999999s)]
*  Yes, totally. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9066.06s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9067.06s)]
*  Sometimes they would take her blindfold off and give her reading assignments in the closet. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9068.06s)]
*  Eldridge Cleaver, George Jackson, Marx, Mao. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9073.38s)]
*  Sometimes they would put the blindfold back on and bring her out of the closet into the [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9078.18s)]
*  living room to listen to their political discussions. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9082.1s)]
*  One day, Donald DeFries told her that there may be no way to safely release her now that [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9086.1s)]
*  she spent so much time with them, and that she may be faced with a choice between either [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9090.96s)]
*  joining the SLA or being killed. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9095.14s)]
*  You know, we've kind of gotten to like you, he's supposed to have said to her, so we don't [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9097.38s)]
*  want to have to kill you if we don't have to. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9102.58s)]
*  Just think about it. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9104.699999999999s)]
*  Something like that. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9106.58s)]
*  One night, after she had been confined to this closet and subjected to this treatment [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9108.82s)]
*  for almost two months, she was led out of the living room to learn about revolutionary [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9113.84s)]
*  sex. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9119.22s)]
*  She was told that she didn't have to participate, of course, but it was considered comradely [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9121.22s)]
*  and it would really go a long way to helping them trust her if she did. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9126.66s)]
*  And so from that night on, the men of the SLA began raping Patty Hearst regularly while [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9130.78s)]
*  she lied there, in her words, like a rag doll waiting for it to be over. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9135.82s)]
*  And this went on for some time. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9140.98s)]
*  DeFries told Patty that the SLA had made a decision regarding her fate after a while. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9143.58s)]
*  She could join them as a full and free member or else be released and go home. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9150.22s)]
*  A little while later, on the sunny morning of April 15th, 1974, the SLA executed a bank [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9157.38s)]
*  robbery in San Francisco that resulted in two customers being shot. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9165.9s)]
*  They got away with just over 10 grand and that night, and for a long time after, the [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9170.779999999999s)]
*  public stared slack-jawed at pictures and footage, surveillance footage, from the holdup [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9176.9s)]
*  which showed the unmistakable image of Patty Hearst holding an M1 carbine and assisting [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9183.18s)]
*  with the robbery. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9188.14s)]
*  And it is hard to even describe how shocking this was for people. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9190.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, other than Watergate, the Patty Hearst saga was probably like the biggest media event [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9195.58s)]
*  of the 1970s. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9201.06s)]
*  Everybody was plugged into this. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9203.3s)]
*  And so when this, everybody wants to know, where's Patty Hearst, what's going to happen? [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9206.46s)]
*  That's just the biggest story. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9209.66s)]
*  And then this footage hits the news that night. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9211.539999999999s)]
*  You have to imagine somebody like Paris Hilton being kidnapped by a violent, radical offshoot [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9214.66s)]
*  of Black Lives Matter. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9219.46s)]
*  And as the Hilton family is scrambling to meet their ransom demands, one day Paris shows [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9221.94s)]
*  up on TV with her kidnappers, toting a machine gun and screaming revolutionary slogans at [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9226.14s)]
*  bank tellers during a robbery. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9231.18s)]
*  It's not a perfect comparison because Patty Hearst wasn't as famous as Paris Hilton before [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9233.86s)]
*  she was kidnapped. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9237.34s)]
*  But she was by the time the bank robbery took place. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9238.98s)]
*  Again, other than Watergate, as far as public obsession and media coverage went, it was [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9242.06s)]
*  the biggest story. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9249.34s)]
*  It was just a massive story that held the attention of the entire country. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9250.34s)]
*  And people were talking about it, debating it. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9253.1s)]
*  Was it Stockholm Syndrome? [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9255.58s)]
*  Was she brainwashed? [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9257.06s)]
*  And again, this is in the context of everything else at the same time that we've been talking [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9258.06s)]
*  about. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9262.22s)]
*  You know, was she just another criminal revolutionary caught up in a mad cause running on the fumes [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9263.22s)]
*  of the 60s? [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9267.48s)]
*  And more than anything, it brought, I told you people had wanted to forget about the [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9270.16s)]
*  60s. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9275.0s)]
*  And this made it impossible. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9276.0s)]
*  It brought the full attention of society onto the question of the 60s. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9277.0s)]
*  And the debate over what had happened to Patty Hearst drew everyone in and expanded into [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9281.439999999999s)]
*  a referendum on the legacy of that whole era. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9286.16s)]
*  And given the nature of the event that kicked that debate off, the general mood of the society [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9290.08s)]
*  at the time as well, the verdict was coming in very negative. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9295.12s)]
*  And Jim Jones was able to put himself right in the middle of all this. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9299.56s)]
*  Again, this is right in the Bay Area. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9302.48s)]
*  This is where Jim's at. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9304.48s)]
*  And he's getting to be a big deal in the community already. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9306.48s)]
*  Since moving to San Francisco permanently, he'd been able to curry favor with local political [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9309.96s)]
*  and community leaders, as well as prominent leaders on the radical left. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9314.92s)]
*  He had relatives of Huey Newton, the founder of the Black Panthers, as members of his church. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9320.96s)]
*  And he became personal friends with Huey over the years. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9326.24s)]
*  He was close friends and business partners with Dr. Carlton Goodlett, who was, he owned [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9329.519999999999s)]
*  several prominent black newspapers in the Bay Area, very respected community leader. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9335.24s)]
*  He was also the Jones family's personal physician. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9340.56s)]

*  credentials. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9527.04s)]

*  The Native American activist received what was probably the largest temple donation, [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9533.12s)]
*  $19,500. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9539.0s)]

*  on a variety of charities and causes. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9546.04s)]
*  For instance, $6,000 to save a senior citizens escort program, $500 each to Cesar Chavez's [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9548.480000000001s)]

*  County drug treatment program. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9559.720000000001s)]
*  But the huge contribution to Banks gave the church predominance in the effort by progressives [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9562.04s)]
*  to block the Indians' extradition to South Dakota for trial on weapons charges indirectly [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9566.16s)]
*  related to the 1973 wounded knee uprising. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9570.52s)]
*  The temple stepped in with nearly $20,000 bail to free Banks' wife Kamuk and their [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9574.52s)]

*  AIM was only one of several groups Jones was cultivating, though philosophically Jones [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9593.68s)]
*  considered his neighbors in the Fillmore Western edition, the black Muslims, to be [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9599.6s)]

*  They're talking about the nation of Islam. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9611.68s)]
*  To be sexist and racist, he respected their discipline and effectiveness in youth work [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9614.16s)]
*  and business enterprises. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9618.54s)]
*  At one time, Jones feared that friction, born largely out of close proximity, might precipitate [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9620.4s)]
*  violence. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9625.48s)]

*  were responsible for an arson fire at the San Francisco temple. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9630.119999999999s)]

*  of them, Jones became furious and sent out his biggest young black men, including the [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9638.52s)]
*  feared gangster Chris Lewis, to the nearby mosque to issue a warning. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9642.88s)]
*  The temple wanted no trouble, but would take no abuse. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9647.0s)]
*  Gradually, however, relations with the black Muslims improved. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9650.199999999999s)]
*  The temple bought fish from Muslim fish stores. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9654.2s)]
*  They even exchanged visitors at some services, which must have been particularly gratifying [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9656.400000000001s)]

*  Through the mid 1970s, Jim's profile would grow and grow until he was becoming one of [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9881.9s)]
*  the more powerful and respected men in the Bay Area political scene. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9888.060000000001s)]
*  There's no question that Tim Ryderman is correct that at least part of the reason Jim was doing [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9892.060000000001s)]
*  all this was to build a shield around himself and his movement in case the chickens ever [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9898.300000000001s)]
*  came home to roost. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9903.02s)]
*  He was incredibly paranoid and he expected that that would happen. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9904.02s)]
*  He was put at ease somewhat by the impeachment of Nixon and the death of J. Edgar Hoover [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9907.94s)]
*  that proved or at least indicated somewhat that the fascist powers pursuing him were [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9912.54s)]
*  not all powerful but the defection of the eight revolutionaries in 1973 which we discussed [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9917.6s)]
*  earlier in another episode, it really flipped a switch in Jim's head that never went back [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9925.26s)]
*  to the off position. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9929.62s)]
*  He never fully trusted almost anybody in his church again. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9930.62s)]
*  They could betray him at any time and by now too many people knew too much so they [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9936.46s)]
*  could do too much damage. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9941.779999999999s)]
*  The eight defectors themselves knew too much and it preoccupied. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9944.099999999999s)]
*  He opened the newspaper every day fearing that he'd read a story that they had leaked [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9949.5s)]
*  to the press or that there would be a knock at the door from police either because the [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9954.74s)]
*  eight revolutionaries had gone to the cops voluntarily or that they'd been picked up [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9959.66s)]
*  and gave Jim up to save themselves. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9964.3s)]
*  He was consumed with worry that the defectors were going to engage in some kind of act of [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9967.82s)]
*  terrorism that would bounce back on him in the temple. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9971.359999999999s)]
*  This fear was amplified when it came out that Donald DeFries, leader of the Symbianese Liberation [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9976.859999999999s)]
*  Army had attended a few temple services. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9982.8s)]
*  Shortly after the Patty Hearst kidnapping Jim tried to sort of head the possibility [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9987.019999999999s)]
*  of that coming out off. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9992.019999999999s)]
*  He had a $2,000 check hand delivered to Randolph Hearst Mansion to help as a donation with [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9993.54s)]
*  the food giveaway. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=9999.34s)]
*  One temple member was a photographer for the Associated Press and so he made sure that [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10001.660000000002s)]
*  news of the temple's donation went out over the wire. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10005.7s)]
*  I'm telling you Jim's good at this but still a few weeks later the temple's contacts within [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10008.54s)]
*  the San Francisco Police Department informed them that the department had opened an investigation [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10015.34s)]
*  into the church after a woman identified only as a 51 year old black housekeeper who was [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10020.86s)]
*  a member of the church reported that she had seen both Donald DeFries and SLA member Nancy [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10025.78s)]
*  Ling Perry at some temple meetings. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10031.94s)]
*  She also reported to the cops seeing armed guards at the Ukiah location and told the [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10035.460000000001s)]
*  cops that she had heard Jim Jones advocate the overthrow of the U.S. government and that [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10040.36s)]
*  one year earlier Jim had mentioned that Randolph Hearst would be a legitimate target as a capitalist [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10045.42s)]
*  enemy. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10052.42s)]
*  Within a month the San Francisco PD's intelligence division, which was investigating Jim, begins [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10053.42s)]
*  receiving a bunch of letters from temple lawyer Tim Stone, which must have been surprising [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10060.06s)]
*  to them because they hadn't said anything to the church about the investigation so they [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10064.54s)]
*  probably knew they had a leak. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10068.460000000001s)]
*  The letters were praising the San Francisco police and insisting that Jim Jones took a [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10070.460000000001s)]
*  strong stand against violence and in private meetings had always denounced both the SLA [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10074.26s)]
*  and the Black Liberation Army. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10079.460000000001s)]
*  Nothing concrete ever came of the investigation. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10082.74s)]
*  It was left just with that testimony of the woman but it actually wasn't the last brush [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10084.9s)]
*  that the temple would have with the SLA. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10088.86s)]
*  After that infamous bank robbery involving Patty Hearst, DeFries figured that the FBI [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10092.460000000001s)]
*  was literally going door to door searching every house in San Francisco to hunt them [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10098.1s)]
*  down and so he ordered everyone to stay inside the apartment but after two days the group [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10101.86s)]
*  was out of food and so DeFries makes a decision, makes an executive decision in the midst of [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10106.42s)]
*  this unprecedented heat to go out and try to recruit new members because they would [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10113.220000000001s)]
*  be unknown to the authorities and his great plan to do this, I mean everybody knew who [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10119.060000000001s)]
*  these people were by this point. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10126.300000000001s)]
*  They're on every TV channel, right? [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10127.54s)]
*  He's looking for them and his plan is to go out and recruit new members and the way he's [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10129.78s)]
*  going to do this is that him and another SLA member are just going to go door to door in [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10134.46s)]
*  the apartment building that they're in introducing themselves as the leaders of the Symbionese [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10140.46s)]
*  Liberation Army and asking people to join. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10144.619999999999s)]
*  And so at first, the first few times they try it they get hostile reactions, the doors [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10148.3s)]
*  slammed in their face and so DeFries realizes that doing this in the same apartment where [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10152.18s)]
*  they're all staying is probably not a good idea and so they take their recruiting drive [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10156.820000000002s)]
*  to the surrounding neighborhood and amazingly after being shut down a few more times they [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10160.820000000002s)]
*  happen to the door of a black Muslim woman who agrees to help them. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10166.34s)]
*  She brings them food and finds them a new apartment but it was in a black neighborhood [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10170.86s)]
*  in Oakland and since all of the SLA except for DeFries were white they had a problem [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10175.76s)]
*  since people were going to notice you know eight or nine white people all moving into [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10180.62s)]
*  a house at once in an all black neighborhood and so joined by three more Nation of Islam [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10185.28s)]
*  recruits they all put on blackface the woman the women put on Afro wigs and before they [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10190.0s)]
*  leave the apartment they destroy the place and dissolve all the evidence and acid in [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10196.94s)]
*  the bathtub and put anti-government graffiti all over the inside walls. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10201.2s)]
*  DeFries tells the team that the robbery of the bank had given them the money that they [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10206.640000000001s)]
*  needed to begin combat operations you know Patty Hearst was just a means to an end that [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10212.96s)]
*  wasn't the end itself it was time to get going and so they were going to start driving around [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10217.359999999999s)]

*  so DeFries gets paranoid that their new Muslim friends might turn on them for the money so [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10237.82s)]
*  he announces that they're picking up stakes and taking their show to Los Angeles. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10241.72s)]
*  From Burrow quote they drove south in three vans the Muslim men had rented for them arriving [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10247.359999999999s)]
*  in Los Angeles on May 10th the first day they they cruised the black neighborhoods of South [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=10253.32s)]

*  But when Shiva Naipaul interviewed Huey Newton there in 1979, Huey had dropped any and all [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11625.06s)]

*  He was very hesitant and circumspect when discussing the 1960s and the early 70s and [[03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11632.939999999999s)]
*  everything that had happened. [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11638.5s)]
*  Over one window at the school, there was a large photograph of Huey from the good old [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11641.519999999999s)]

*  the result of misunderstandings and agents provocateur. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11664.78s)]
*  And he said that all he wanted were some basic social democratic reforms that honestly could [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11668.58s)]
*  have been lifted from the moderate left to the Democratic Party platform. [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11672.98s)]

*  Huey Newton was murdered in 1989 by a member of a group called the Black Guerrilla Family, [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11681.42s)]

*  Patty and the remaining members of the group checked into a motel room just in time to [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11704.54s)]

*  the couch and watched in horror as their friends were shot and burned to death. [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11722.86s)]
*  After that inferno, they wandered around from town to town with duffel bags full of guns, [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11728.220000000001s)]

*  out and accomplishing nothing. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11738.58s)]
*  One of them said that she had an old friend that she thought could be trusted to help [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11741.58s)]
*  them out and the friend who turned out to be a fangirl of the SLA agreed to be their [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11745.26s)]
*  above ground helper. [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11749.92s)]
*  She helped them find some cover, some new cover, and the group starts releasing more [[03:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11751.54s)]

*  the New World Liberation Front or NWLF. [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11766.1s)]
*  And pretty soon there were bombs being exploded all over the Bay Area in the name of the NWLF [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11770.3s)]
*  with communiques following them. [[03:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11776.02s)]
*  There were 37 bombings in the nine months after the NWLF was announced. [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11777.58s)]
*  It's like one a week. [[03:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11782.26s)]
*  Only in September of 75, Patty and the rest of the SLA members were tracked down and arrested [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11785.66s)]
*  and Patty's trial was a months long media spectacle. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11791.82s)]
*  Her lawyers argued that she couldn't be held responsible for her actions because she'd [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11796.46s)]
*  been brainwashed. [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11799.98s)]
*  But people did not want to hear that excuse anymore. [[03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11802.42s)]
*  Even though I mean, gosh, she'd been through a lot, right? [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11806.42s)]
*  But the society had really moved and they had turned on all of this stuff so much that [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11808.92s)]
*  they did not want to hear it. [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11813.78s)]
*  And she was convicted and she went to prison. [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11815.66s)]
*  Bay Area police officials announced to everybody that they could rest easy now. [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11820.140000000001s)]
*  The SLA was behind bars and so the NWLF bombings would come to a stop. [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11824.74s)]
*  But they didn't. [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11830.980000000001s)]
*  The bombings continued. [[03:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11832.26s)]
*  They were left at night to explode at electric company transformers, Air Force radar sites, [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11834.7s)]
*  TV stations, government buildings. [[03:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11840.5s)]
*  One of them blew up at the home of a board member of the Safeway Stores Corporation. [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11843.22s)]
*  And the communicates that followed them were all over the map. [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11849.099999999999s)]
*  They attacked slumlords, talked about conditions in jails, announced support for unions during [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11851.42s)]
*  labor disputes. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11857.699999999999s)]
*  These things came so often that an FBI agent called San Francisco the Belfast of North [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11859.58s)]
*  America. [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11863.699999999999s)]
*  Although these bombings were obviously much less deadly. [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11866.38s)]
*  The authorities had no idea what's going on or who's behind these bombings. [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11869.66s)]
*  They came to believe that there were several teams working independently with nothing to [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11875.1s)]
*  do with one another who were just using, they were just inspired by the SLA and using the [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11878.9s)]
*  name of the NWLF to do this bombing. [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11882.66s)]
*  In November of 75, the NWLF introduced a new tactic, pouring liquid steel into the locks [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11885.619999999999s)]
*  of some 500 parking meters in San Francisco. [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11891.38s)]
*  They began delivering their communicates in person through a 37-year-old weed dealer calling [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11896.42s)]
*  himself Jacques Rogiers, but whose name was just Jack Rogers. [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11901.14s)]
*  He would pick up the communicates and deliver them. [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11905.94s)]
*  And he was uninvolved with the bombings. [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11909.06s)]
*  He was at least one person separated from the people who were doing the bombings and [[03:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11910.82s)]
*  vandalism. [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11915.34s)]
*  And so following him didn't get the police anywhere. [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11916.34s)]
*  And this went on for several years. [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11918.58s)]
*  There were at least 70 bombings in San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley. [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11921.02s)]
*  One of them was left in a window box at the house of Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11926.460000000001s)]
*  a San Francisco city supervisor at the time. [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11931.3s)]
*  More transformers were targeted. [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11934.26s)]
*  Bombs went off in the bathroom of a women's jail. [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11936.460000000001s)]
*  They were placed to explode under parked cars, including one under a Volvo owned by the San [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11939.66s)]
*  Francisco district attorney who happened to be the boss of People's Temple lawyer Tim [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11943.98s)]
*  Stone. [[03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11948.62s)]
*  Another bomb was thrown at the house of city supervisor John Barbagalotta, but missed its [[03:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11950.86s)]
*  mark and blew up his neighbor's swing set. [[03:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11957.12s)]
*  When Jacques Rogiers was finally brought up on conspiracy charges, the judge found that [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11960.380000000001s)]
*  he had been acting as a journalist by delivering the communicates and he was found not guilty. [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11965.1s)]
*  And the bombings just went on. [[03:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11970.26s)]
*  The Marin County Courthouse was hit. [[03:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11972.34s)]
*  The San Francisco Opera House was hit. [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11974.300000000001s)]
*  It just went on and on. [[03:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11976.26s)]
*  It turned out that the cops were right, that there were different groups operating independently [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11979.26s)]
*  under the NWLF name, but the majority of the significant actions turned out to have been [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11983.02s)]
*  carried out by just two people. [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11988.82s)]
*  Ronald Huffman and Maureen Minton were their names. [[03:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11991.460000000001s)]
*  And now Ronald Huffman was a mentally deranged weed dealer living at his pot farm in the [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=11996.5s)]
*  hills above Santa Cruz, California. [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12002.06s)]
*  Maureen Minton was his girlfriend, daughter of lumber store owners who had graduated with [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12004.660000000002s)]
*  honors from Berkeley in 1970, but got into the commune scene after college and ended [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12009.34s)]
*  up shacking up with Huffman, helping him care for his plants and volunteering part time [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12013.660000000002s)]
*  at Planned Parenthood. [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12018.220000000001s)]
*  Huffman was known as an eccentric figure around Santa Cruz. [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12021.34s)]
*  People called him Revolutionary Ron. [[03:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12024.300000000001s)]
*  He had a dog named Che. [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12026.460000000001s)]
*  And he and Minton had become inspired after watching the SLA burn up in LA and they started [[03:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12028.86s)]
*  using their spare time to build bombs. [[03:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12034.58s)]
*  And their story, if you think the SLA's story didn't end well, these guys' story did not [[03:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12038.02s)]
*  end well either. [[03:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12041.82s)]
*  It's kind of a, I guess it's kind of a theme. [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12042.82s)]
*  Quote, Huffman, it is clear, was never the most stable soul. [[03:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12045.62s)]
*  According to a relative interviewed by prosecutors, he was prone to violent mood swings. [[03:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12050.66s)]
*  In the wake of the final NWLF bombing, there is considerable evidence that Huffman began [[03:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12055.42s)]
*  losing his grip on reality. [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12059.74s)]
*  Feral dogs and coyotes roamed the area where he lived in those days and Huffman became [[03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12062.06s)]
*  obsessed with them, calling them demon dogs, whose incessant howling was the voice of Satan. [[03:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12066.46s)]
*  Psychiatrists would later debate whether Huffman was schizophrenic, drug-addled, or just a weird [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12071.779999999999s)]
*  guy, but what's unavoidable is that over time the focus of his anger became his girlfriend, [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12076.34s)]
*  Maureen Minton. [[03:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12081.539999999999s)]
*  The couple had a worker named Dennis Morgan, who helped tend the marijuana farm. [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12083.58s)]
*  Morgan later told prosecutors that he became increasingly frightened of Huffman. [[03:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12088.5s)]
*  According to Morgan, Huffman developed a long list of complaints against Minton. [[03:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12092.74s)]
*  She hadn't watered the weed enough, or she'd watered it too much. [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12097.14s)]
*  She neglected to give Chay his heartworm medicine. [[03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12100.5s)]
*  She didn't respect Huffman's grandfather. [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12103.06s)]
*  Huffman's lawyer would later claim that his client believed that Minton herself was possessed [[03:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12105.66s)]
*  by demons. [[03:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12109.06s)]
*  Minton told an aunt that, all demons aside, Huffman was incensed that she had had an abortion [[03:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12110.9s)]
*  against his wishes. [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12115.5s)]
*  Morgan later swore that Huffman told him he was getting rid of Minton and finding himself [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12117.46s)]
*  a new lady, one who would bear him children. [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12124.859999999999s)]
*  Whatever the reason, there is little doubt as to what happened on a bright Sunday morning [[03:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12128.779999999999s)]
*  in September. [[03:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12132.539999999999s)]
*  Standing in their yard, Huffman ordered Minton to kneel before him. [[03:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12134.3s)]
*  For some reason he slid a draftsman's knife into her mouth. [[03:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12138.14s)]
*  Then, lifting a long-handled axe, he swung it viciously down onto her skull, all but [[03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12141.859999999999s)]
*  splitting her head in two. [[03:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12146.54s)]
*  Minton died instantly. [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12148.74s)]
*  Huffman then took a two-by-four and beat her body, hoping his attorney would later claim [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12150.54s)]
*  to knock the demons out of her corpse. [[03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12154.7s)]
*  Apparently unsatisfied, he took a scalpel and cut out a section of her brain. [[03:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12157.74s)]
*  His attorney would insist that Huffman believe Minton's brain matter had magical powers. [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12162.02s)]
*  A few hours later, Huffman packed a suitcase and threw it in his car, along with $32,000 [[03:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12166.66s)]
*  in cash, ten bags of marijuana, a book, the greatest story ever told, and a paper sack [[03:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12172.1s)]
*  containing a portion of Minton's brain. [[03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12177.58s)]
*  He drove down to the Pacific Coast Highway and turned north toward San Francisco. [[03:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12180.26s)]
*  A few miles up the road, just past the beach at Greyhound Rock, he picked up a German hitchhiker, [[03:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12184.98s)]
*  driving off so quickly that he left the young man's girlfriend in the road. [[03:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12190.5s)]
*  Huffman, who appeared highly agitated, was talking a mile a minute, and the poor German [[03:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12194.380000000001s)]
*  couldn't understand what he was saying. [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12198.98s)]
*  He pleaded with Huffman to stop the car, at which point Huffman produced a knife and [[03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12201.1s)]
*  started slashing at him. [[03:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12204.62s)]
*  A struggle ensued, during which the car skidded to a stop outside the shortstop market in [[03:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12206.18s)]
*  Half Moon Bay. [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12210.94s)]
*  The hitchhiker leaped from the car and raced toward a young man named Cory Baker, who was [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12213.06s)]
*  standing in the parking lot. [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12217.220000000001s)]
*  Huffman emerged and began yelling something unintelligible. [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12219.2s)]
*  Baker approached him, noticing a strange whitish-gray substance on his hands. [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12222.220000000001s)]
*  He thought it was fish guts. [[03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12227.16s)]
*  It wasn't. [[03:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12228.94s)]
*  He told Huffman to calm down and go wash his hands. [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12231.06s)]
*  Huffman responded by punching him, grabbing a fountain pen and attempting to poke out [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12233.98s)]
*  his eyes. [[03:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12237.5s)]
*  Baker ran. [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12238.74s)]
*  Huffman drove off. [[03:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12239.9s)]
*  An hour later, a police car managed to force him off the road near the town of Pacifica. [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12241.06s)]
*  Huffman got out of the car, swearing and spitting, his eyes rolling back in his head. [[03:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12246.02s)]
*  When an officer pulled his gun, Huffman held up his book and the bag of brains as if to [[03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12250.06s)]
*  shield himself. [[03:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12255.1s)]
*  Officers wrestled him to the ground. [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12257.26s)]
*  Later, when they visited the cottage, they found Minton's body, and Huffman was tossed [[03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12258.7s)]
*  into jail." [[03:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12262.7s)]
*  End quote. [[03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12264.7s)]
*  So this is how things turn out. [[03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12267.820000000002s)]
*  This is how the long story that started with brave marchers in Birmingham and the Berkeley [[03:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12270.66s)]
*  Free Speech Movement and progressed through the near revolution of 68, through the Panthers [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12278.460000000001s)]
*  and Weather Underground to the Black Liberation Army and the worship of black convicts by [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12284.3s)]
*  the white radicals to the SLA and the NWLF. [[03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12289.019999999999s)]
*  This is how that story goes as the 70s drag on. [[03:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12293.699999999999s)]
*  By the end, the scene is just hollowed out and gone and finished. [[03:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12298.42s)]
*  Except for Jim Jones and People's Temple. [[03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12307.06s)]
*  They're still there. [[03:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12309.46s)]
*  And not just there, they're bigger and richer and more influential than ever. [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12311.06s)]
*  Sort of the last man standing on the radical left. [[03:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12315.859999999999s)]
*  And for the black people in the ghettos of the cities where the temple operated, the [[03:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12319.66s)]
*  old ladies and kids and single moms and guys who were the other 99% of black people who [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12324.22s)]
*  had nothing to do with any of the violence and craziness of the last several years and [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12330.019999999999s)]
*  were just trying to get through the day and build a normal life, the temple became more [[03:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12334.34s)]
*  significant than ever as everything else that had risen up claiming to stand for them [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12339.26s)]
*  over the last decade fell down around their heads. [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12344.300000000001s)]
*  But of course, unbeknownst to the people watching Jim preach and heal on Sundays, Jim Jones [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12347.94s)]
*  himself was speeding at 100 miles an hour toward the same cliff that the rest of the [[03:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12355.460000000001s)]
*  radical left had barreled over. [[03:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12360.06s)]
*  And underneath all the idiosyncrasies of the temple and of Jim himself, he was heading [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12363.34s)]
*  toward that cliff for much the same reason. [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12368.94s)]
*  By 1973, he was seeing enemies everywhere. [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12373.140000000001s)]
*  Increasingly, the whole world was becoming an enemy. [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12378.54s)]
*  Psychologists sometimes call people with paranoid disorder. [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12385.220000000001s)]
*  They say that they have a warfare personality at war with everyone and everything. [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12388.7s)]
*  Well, after the eight revolutionaries defected from the temple in 1973, more of them followed [[03:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12396.58s)]
*  in 1974, including a married couple, Al and Jeannie Mills, who had left the temple after [[03:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12402.220000000001s)]
*  temple officials beat their daughter savagely at a meeting. [[03:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12408.02s)]
*  Front of dozens, maybe 100 people cheering on screaming as it went on, hitting her over [[03:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12413.660000000002s)]
*  70 times for allegedly becoming too close to a girl who was supposed to have been a [[03:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12419.02s)]
*  lesbian. [[03:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12422.82s)]
*  When they got out, the Mills changed their name because they had given power of attorney [[03:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12426.46s)]
*  over their daughter to the temple. [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12430.14s)]
*  But they didn't just duck and hide. [[03:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12433.22s)]
*  After the Mills left, they got in contact with other people who had left and they tried [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12435.86s)]
*  to get in touch with people who were still in the temple that they thought might be persuadable, [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12439.619999999999s)]
*  began trying to organize against people's temple and to get the authorities finally [[03:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12444.58s)]
*  to do something about what was going on. [[03:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12449.06s)]
*  Jim didn't know which way the attack was going to come from, but he knew it was going to [[03:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12453.82s)]
*  come one way or another and he had to prepare. [[03:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12457.82s)]
*  Jim had money, lots of it by now, millions and millions of dollars put away by now, and [[03:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12462.38s)]
*  he had people at his disposal who would do whatever he said, which meant that he had [[03:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12467.9s)]
*  options. [[03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12471.859999999999s)]
*  But as first a few and then a few more members began to leak out of the temple, Jim wondered [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12475.220000000001s)]
*  when the whole thing was going to come crashing down, when it would just accelerate and the [[03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12482.74s)]
*  spell would break and fall apart and those options might evaporate. [[03:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12487.02s)]
*  The eight revolutionaries had all been involved in the temple's college program, meaning that [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12492.94s)]
*  they had been spending a lot of time around non-temple members and with each other, but [[03:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12497.86s)]
*  away from the rest of the temple. [[03:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12503.900000000001s)]
*  Jim was paranoid about this before it became an obsession now because he had missed their [[03:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12506.54s)]
*  potential for treason even as it grew like a cancer right in the guts of the movement. [[03:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12511.380000000001s)]
*  And so he instructed his closest, most trustworthy advisors to start taking extraordinary actions [[03:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12517.1s)]
*  to counter attempts at subversion and sabotage, which again he was seeing everywhere now. [[03:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12523.58s)]
*  They were expected to spy on people, use blackmail, harassment, even assault in defense [[03:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12530.78s)]
*  of the church. [[03:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12538.18s)]
*  All actions of course, Jim said, that ran counter to his moral preference, but which [[03:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12539.34s)]
*  were necessary evils in time of war. [[03:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12544.820000000002s)]
*  And war is how Jim and his tight circle increasingly came to see the relationship with the outside. [[03:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12547.140000000001s)]
*  And when they were a ragtag community group, they imagined themselves with enemies that [[03:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12554.7s)]
*  were fit for a ragtag community group. [[03:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12561.02s)]
*  They were beset by racist hoodlums and maybe a local politician or two, but the scope of [[03:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12562.980000000001s)]
*  their enemies grew with their own ambition and self-regard until eventually they are [[03:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12568.58s)]
*  imagining that the small but growing number of defectors and former temple members were [[03:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12573.820000000002s)]
*  allied with the FBI, the CIA, Interpol, all the forces arrayed against the global revolution, [[03:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12580.7s)]
*  which more and more as the others went down, people's temple imagined themselves to be [[03:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12586.380000000001s)]
*  the last remaining vestige, the last ones manning the barricades as the forces of fascism [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12591.54s)]
*  had knocked down the others one by one. [[03:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12597.66s)]
*  And you might imagine that somebody who imagined himself to be locked into mortal combat with [[03:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12600.460000000001s)]
*  a global evil wouldn't be bothered with average everyday members who were not insiders deciding [[03:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12607.04s)]
*  to leave his movement. [[03:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12615.400000000001s)]
*  But the opposite was true. [[03:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12616.880000000001s)]
*  Jim could not tolerate it. [[03:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12618.44s)]
*  He could not tolerate the idea of anybody abandoning him. [[03:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12620.960000000001s)]
*  Partly that's because this is how cults operate. [[03:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12627.720000000001s)]
*  Partly it's because of Jim's personality. [[03:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12629.880000000001s)]
*  I mean, cults create a new world for their people. [[03:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12632.52s)]
*  If you ask what's the difference between a cult and a religion, there's probably a lot [[03:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12636.64s)]
*  of different answers that you could give, but one of them is that cults isolate their [[03:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12639.48s)]
*  members, they cut them off from the people in the world that they knew before and isolate them. [[03:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12644.76s)]
*  For the fanatics, fear of outsiders and a rigid emotionally charged us versus them dynamic [[03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12653.28s)]
*  is enough to make that happen. [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12660.2s)]
*  But for the rest of the people, the people who are something less than a fanatic, enforcement [[03:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12662.2s)]
*  is required. [[03:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12667.2s)]
*  Enforcement by the fanatics. [[03:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12669.68s)]
*  Members should be afraid to leave. [[03:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12671.320000000002s)]
*  And ideally they're afraid of the outsiders. [[03:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12673.68s)]
*  But if they're not, then they should be afraid of us. [[03:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12676.640000000001s)]
*  Partly for their own good, but partly because treason begets more treason. [[03:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12681.800000000001s)]
*  Treason spreads. [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12685.12s)]
*  And you can denounce them as a traitor or a fascist all you want. [[03:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12687.64s)]
*  But there's going to be one or two people who knew them pretty well, who know better. [[03:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12692.519999999999s)]
*  And now they see you lying about the person and their gears start to turn and so it spreads. [[03:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12697.96s)]
*  Imagine a castle under siege. [[03:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12703.64s)]
*  You and your people are inside the walls surrounded by an enemy army. [[03:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12708.24s)]
*  If one of your people on the inside starts going around telling everybody else that this [[03:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12712.48s)]
*  isn't a castle, it's a prison, and the army outside is not an enemy at all, it's a group [[03:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12716.84s)]
*  of people trying to rescue us, it might be appropriate to hang that person for treason [[03:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12721.52s)]
*  if you really are under siege. [[03:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12727.96s)]
*  But under siege is how Jim felt from 1973 on. [[03:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12730.48s)]
*  And it just got worse and worse and more acute. [[03:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12736.4s)]
*  Jim tried everything, went to extreme lengths to prevent even non-insiders, just regular [[03:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12740.56s)]
*  members from leaving the temple. [[03:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12746.92s)]
*  A woman named Janelle Smart, she had only ever had one foot in the temple. [[03:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12750.119999999999s)]
*  She'd attend every other weekend or so when Jim would preach in Los Angeles, which is [[03:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12754.64s)]
*  where she was, she would skip the others. [[03:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12758.76s)]
*  And pretty quickly she lost interest, but the temple was a good environment for her [[03:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12761.68s)]
*  kids and her mother and uncle attended and the kids would go with their grandmother and [[03:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12764.8s)]
*  so she would hang around the periphery of the church. [[03:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12769.640000000001s)]
*  She'd be at some of the potlucks and some of the events and sometimes she'd show up [[03:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12771.56s)]
*  to pick up the kids after a service and sometimes she would go to the services. [[03:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12775.640000000001s)]
*  But she was smart and she knew how to work and so they tried to suck her in, they tried [[03:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12782.28s)]
*  to pull her in and they asked her to be a part of the planning commission and she accepted, [[03:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12785.68s)]
*  gave it a shot. [[03:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12791.48s)]
*  And when she was in there she got a glimpse of the temple from the inside. [[03:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12793.48s)]
*  She saw the struggle sessions and the corporal punishments and she thought it was strange, [[03:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12797.08s)]
*  but you know, she was told that we know what we're doing. [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12802.64s)]
*  Every treatment is tailored to the individual, every treatment has a purpose. [[03:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12807.24s)]
*  One of Jim's most trusted henchmen, Tim Carter, is a guy who used to threaten defectors at [[03:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12813.12s)]
*  their homes for Jim. [[03:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12819.18s)]
*  He's a guy who watched his wife and child die in Jonestown and then obeyed orders to [[03:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12821.16s)]
*  carry Jim's bags full of money out of the camp to the Soviet embassy. [[03:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12825.88s)]
*  He justified the abuse long after the fact this way, quote, [[03:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12830.08s)]
*  At least 80% of all problems in the temple were not even brought up in public meetings. [[03:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12835.359999999999s)]
*  Step one, if somebody screwed up was counseling. [[03:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12840.439999999999s)]
*  Step two was more counseling. [[03:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12843.199999999999s)]
*  Step three, you were called up on the carpet. [[03:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12845.32s)]
*  Sometimes being called up in front of everybody, that humiliation worked where counseling didn't. [[03:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12848.519999999999s)]
*  I remember one boy, 11 or 12, had watched his father murder his mother. [[03:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12853.880000000001s)]
*  The kid was very antisocial. [[03:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12859.08s)]
*  In fact, he was a bully. [[03:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12860.240000000002s)]
*  He got one-on-one counseling in the temple for years, just everything the temple knew [[03:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12863.0s)]
*  how to do, and he was never brought up until one day in San Francisco he got a spanking, [[03:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12866.52s)]
*  five whacks. [[03:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12871.52s)]
*  And after that, he changed. [[03:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12872.52s)]
*  The discipline worked where love hadn't. [[03:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12875.160000000002s)]
*  The kid only responded to fear, end quote. [[03:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12877.160000000002s)]
*  I remember one of Jim's most loyal followers, Mike Prokes, excused the abuse by pointing [[03:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12881.6s)]
*  out that the temple had to manage a collection of people who were often mentally ill or dangerous. [[03:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12886.64s)]
*  Because they didn't turn anyone away, and they didn't throw anyone out. [[03:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12896.56s)]
*  So they had felons, sex offenders, drug addicts, people who were mentally handicapped or suffered [[03:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12899.8s)]
*  from emotional or behavioral disorders. [[03:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12907.16s)]
*  In a previous episode, I mentioned a member who had been caught molesting a temple child, [[03:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12911.12s)]
*  a 10-year-old boy. [[03:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12915.28s)]
*  And so temple men held him down and beat his genitals on a table with a thick rubber hose [[03:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12917.400000000001s)]
*  until they were swollen up like black and purple grapefruits, and he was bedridden for [[03:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12922.08s)]
*  a while. [[03:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12926.36s)]
*  But they didn't kick that guy out. [[03:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12927.400000000001s)]
*  They just told him that if we catch you doing this again, it's going to be much, much worse. [[03:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12930.240000000002s)]
*  Because they didn't throw people out. [[03:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12934.76s)]
*  They would have issued a death sentence themselves on one of their members before they turned [[03:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12937.96s)]
*  one of their own over to the fascists. [[03:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12943.16s)]
*  It's not like they had jails. [[03:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12946.64s)]
*  And so they had to do what they had to do, and physical punishment was it. [[03:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12948.48s)]
*  But Janelle Smart, in these planning commission meetings, whatever excuses they gave her about [[03:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12955.4s)]
*  the purpose of all this was soon witnessing behavior that could not be explained away [[03:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12960.08s)]
*  as well-intentioned discipline. [[03:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12965.44s)]
*  There was a sadism and a cruelty and an arbitrariness about it that you just couldn't escape as [[03:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12969.28s)]
*  time went on. [[03:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12973.84s)]
*  At PC meetings, Jim would often recline on a couch with blankets and pillows while the [[03:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12977.84s)]
*  rest of the group was sitting on the hard floor around him like children. [[03:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12982.34s)]
*  At these all-night meetings, 2, 3, 4 in the morning, next to him would be a table with [[03:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12986.16s)]
*  juices and sodas, platters of fruits, cheeses, meats. [[03:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12991.400000000001s)]
*  And he would munch on them as these meetings just dragged on all night and nobody else [[03:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12994.800000000001s)]
*  has anything. [[03:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=12998.720000000001s)]
*  Occasionally, he would have the platters passed around, but everybody quickly learned that [[03:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13000.04s)]
*  they better decline the offer because not doing that was looked upon as selfish and [[03:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13004.880000000001s)]
*  it was a guaranteed way to make sure that you were going to become the target of one [[03:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13010.28s)]
*  of these struggle sessions. [[03:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13013.800000000001s)]
*  Other times he would sit up at an elevated podium like a judge instructing and lecturing [[03:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13017.56s)]
*  and sometimes berating his people, directing the catharsis sessions sometimes by subtle [[03:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13023.96s)]
*  words and looks and other times by just pointing people out and directing the group against [[03:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13029.9s)]
*  them and amplifying the ferocity of the attack. [[03:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13034.72s)]
*  And he would always make sure that someone's friends and relatives, the people closest [[03:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13037.119999999999s)]
*  to them, were the least restrained in their viciousness. [[03:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13041.26s)]
*  And everybody knew that everybody else was watching for that. [[03:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13044.86s)]
*  You know, if your wife or husband was pointed out to be the target of one of these struggle [[03:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13049.62s)]
*  sessions, you not only had to participate, you had better be the one going at them the [[03:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13054.54s)]
*  absolute hardest because if you didn't, everybody, that was going to become a thing. [[03:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13060.060000000001s)]
*  Another two of you were going to be looked at as suspicious, like maybe you're favoring [[03:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13065.26s)]
*  each other over the rest of the group. [[03:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13069.140000000001s)]
*  Just imagine being two, three in the morning and you're in a room with a hundred people, [[03:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13072.74s)]
*  all the people you know, I mean increasingly as time went on, and by this point is already [[03:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13079.66s)]
*  true, people don't hang out or be around in a social context, anybody who's not in the [[03:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13083.539999999999s)]
*  temple. [[03:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13088.82s)]
*  And so these are all the people you know. [[03:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13089.82s)]
*  These people are your whole life. [[03:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13091.539999999999s)]
*  And you're in this room and it's the middle of the night and these people are frothing [[03:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13094.22s)]
*  at the mouth and screaming at you and beating you, physically attacking you. [[03:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13099.18s)]
*  And your own husband is doing it, your own wife, your parents, you know, your kids are [[03:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13106.14s)]
*  being brought out to make accusations against you. [[03:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13111.02s)]
*  It was just an incredibly shockingly dangerous and toxic environment. [[03:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13116.380000000001s)]
*  And as this is going on, it would always be Jim, this was a right that he reserved for [[03:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13123.460000000001s)]
*  himself. [[03:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13127.26s)]
*  This was a situation that would swoop in as the savior. [[03:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13128.34s)]
*  If anybody else dared say, you know, maybe we should take it easy, it was on, they were [[03:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13130.86s)]
*  going to get it. [[03:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13135.34s)]
*  But Jim would come in and he would say, peace, peace, peace, okay, it's been far enough, [[03:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13138.58s)]
*  you know, I think this person is loyal, I know that he loves me or she loves me. [[03:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13142.42s)]
*  And he'd be so thankful because he ended this abuse. [[03:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13147.06s)]
*  At one meeting at which Smart was present, Jim was complaining about the sexual demands [[03:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13152.66s)]
*  that his followers were placing on him. [[03:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13158.82s)]
*  This would just, I mean, you know, by the time you get to the middle 70s, they spent [[03:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13161.86s)]
*  80% of their time talking about sex and who was having sex with Jim and him complaining [[03:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13165.26s)]
*  about having to have sex with all you people. [[03:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13170.18s)]
*  It was just a non-stop topic. [[03:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13171.82s)]
*  And so he orders everybody in the room that he had had to sleep with recently to stand [[03:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13174.7s)]
*  up. [[03:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13180.06s)]
*  And it's just a very, very, very weird people. [[03:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13181.46s)]
*  At least 30 people get to their feet. [[03:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13182.46s)]
*  And everybody else starts shouting at them and yelling at them for being so selfish with [[03:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13183.46s)]
*  Jim's energy and how dare they? [[03:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13187.74s)]
*  Don't they know that father has to save his energy to serve the people? [[03:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13190.26s)]
*  And everybody's looking all sheepish. [[03:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13194.22s)]
*  And then the attention of the crowd turns to this young woman who hadn't stood up. [[03:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13196.98s)]
*  She had not had sex with Jim. [[03:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13201.14s)]
*  And they start accusing her of wanting to have sex with Jim and they start attacking [[03:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13204.019999999999s)]
*  her for being so selfish. [[03:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13207.779999999999s)]
*  And so Jim orders this 23 year old woman to stand up and she stands up. [[03:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13211.34s)]
*  And he orders her to tell him and everybody in the room what it is that she thinks she [[03:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13217.5s)]
*  has to offer him sexually. [[03:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13222.62s)]
*  And she starts stuttering. [[03:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13225.220000000001s)]
*  She's incredibly embarrassed, of course. [[03:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13226.380000000001s)]
*  And he interrupts her and says, take off all your clothes. [[03:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13228.220000000001s)]
*  And so she takes off all her clothes and she's standing before the crowd completely naked. [[03:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13233.7s)]
*  He makes her keep her hands at her side. [[03:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13239.94s)]
*  She can't cover herself. [[03:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13241.26s)]
*  She's turning beet red. [[03:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13242.26s)]
*  And Jim starts telling the crowd how she's been coming on to him and they all start laughing [[03:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13244.86s)]
*  at her and insulting her and pointing out all the deficiencies in her body, all her [[03:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13248.82s)]
*  blemishes, talking about how ugly and disgusting she is, laughing at her. [[03:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13253.3s)]
*  And she's just beet red, exposed with her arms at her sides. [[03:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13258.46s)]
*  And Jim just is piling on, mocking her. [[03:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13265.38s)]
*  He says, if there's a list of people that I wouldn't touch in this place, you'd be on [[03:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13268.7s)]
*  top of that list. [[03:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13272.34s)]
*  The crowd laughs at her and launches again, insulting her body and her looks and her selfishness. [[03:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13273.94s)]
*  And Jim calls for silence. [[03:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13278.9s)]
*  And he demands that the woman admit that she wants him to die. [[03:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13280.58s)]
*  You want me to die, don't you? [[03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13283.06s)]
*  And so she denies that. [[03:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13285.7s)]
*  And he verbally abuses her some more. [[03:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13288.1s)]
*  And then he sits back and watches over the top of his sunglasses, chuckling as the crowd [[03:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13290.98s)]
*  carries on abusing this woman for a while. [[03:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13295.22s)]
*  And when she's been sufficiently humiliated and broken, Jim moves on to the next order [[03:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13297.82s)]
*  of business. [[03:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13303.26s)]
*  But he forces her to remain standing naked in the middle of the room as there are kids [[03:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13304.26s)]
*  in this place. [[03:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13309.539999999999s)]
*  A lot of times in these planning commission meetings, people's little kids would attend [[03:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13310.539999999999s)]
*  these meetings. [[03:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13313.779999999999s)]
*  So you've got this is happening to this woman in front of everybody she knows, all of her [[03:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13314.779999999999s)]
*  friends, family, little kids, all these people just screaming, frothing at the mouth, wide-eyed, [[03:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13318.66s)]
*  abusing this woman like this. [[03:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13325.34s)]
*  It's just it's it's it got this sadistic. [[03:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13328.380000000001s)]
*  And they just spent the next several hours afterwards discussing other issues while she [[03:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13331.18s)]
*  had to stand there naked. [[03:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13335.900000000001s)]
*  And the young woman remained loyal to People's Temple and Jim Jones. [[03:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13339.060000000001s)]
*  Janelle Smart was there. [[03:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13344.62s)]
*  She was disgusted by the incident, but she stuck around. [[03:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13345.62s)]
*  She stuck around until the day when the crowd turned on her. [[03:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13348.44s)]
*  Her husband had been a member of the church, but it stopped attending and so naturally [[03:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13353.02s)]
*  was looked upon with suspicion. [[03:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13357.300000000001s)]
*  And at this PC meeting, somebody alleged that he, Smart's husband, had tapped Jim Jones' [[03:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13359.7s)]
*  phone and that she, Janelle Smart, must have known about it. [[03:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13364.66s)]
*  I mean, utter absurdity. [[03:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13367.66s)]
*  These are regular people. [[03:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13370.42s)]
*  They're not tapping Jim Jones' phone. [[03:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13371.42s)]
*  But the crowd turns its focus on her and starts screaming and going insane. [[03:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13374.220000000001s)]
*  And she breaks down crying. [[03:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13378.74s)]
*  And she says, I've had enough of this. [[03:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13380.02s)]
*  I want out. [[03:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13381.5s)]
*  And so Jim says, well, you can go. [[03:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13383.38s)]
*  But your mother and your uncle aren't going anywhere. [[03:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13387.019999999999s)]
*  They're still members. [[03:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13390.3s)]
*  And so you're going to have to move at least 100 miles away so that you're not going to [[03:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13391.3s)]
*  negatively influence them or your four children who are also going to remain in the temple [[03:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13394.939999999999s)]
*  with your mother. [[03:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13400.58s)]
*  And she said, I've lived in L.A. my entire life. [[03:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13403.339999999998s)]
*  I can't leave. [[03:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13405.339999999998s)]
*  Everything's here. [[03:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13406.699999999999s)]
*  I can't leave L.A. And so Jim says, OK, I'll give you another option. [[03:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13407.699999999999s)]
*  You can leave if you sign over custody of your four kids to people's temple. [[03:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13411.5s)]
*  So that we know you're not going to try to ruin these kids' lives by by by taking them [[03:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13417.380000000001s)]
*  away from from their real family. [[03:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13421.34s)]
*  And so Smart says that she figures in the heat of the moment, I mean, again, like you [[03:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13424.42s)]
*  remember, you got to remember the middle of the night, she's in a room with these 100 [[03:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13428.42s)]
*  people who she has seen beat people to a pulp. [[03:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13431.74s)]
*  Right. And this is the kind of pressure she's under. [[03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13436.86s)]
*  And she says she figured something like that's never going to hold up in court anyway. [[03:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13440.7s)]
*  Her three minor children all lived with their father whom she was divorced from and her [[03:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13444.78s)]
*  eldest was 19. And so she said, fine, sure. [[03:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13450.26s)]
*  Whatever. Bring it out. [[03:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13452.3s)]
*  So they draw up this document and she signs it. [[03:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13453.619999999999s)]
*  And then Jim orders somebody to bring out a gun and somebody produces a pistol. [[03:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13456.98s)]
*  And they make Janelle Smart hold this pistol. [[03:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13463.1s)]
*  And once it's covered with her fingerprints, it's placed in a bag and taken away. [[03:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13466.14s)]
*  And she's told that if she ever takes any action against the temple or says anything [[03:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13470.74s)]
*  bad about Jim Jones, then that gun is going to be used in a crime in order to frame her. [[03:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13475.98s)]
*  And so Janelle Smart left the church, but her mother and her uncle and her four kids [[03:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13482.98s)]
*  remained active. And she knew these people were crazy by this point, but. [[03:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13487.74s)]
*  This is I mean, it's kind of terrifying for a single person, especially when your mother [[03:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13493.9s)]
*  and uncle are still are still loyal to this place. [[03:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13497.58s)]
*  You're going to take all of these people on, you know what they're capable of. [[03:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13500.74s)]
*  You know, and it's not like the craziness really seemed to leak out into the public [[03:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13506.26s)]
*  activities with the regular members, which is where her kids, you know, the kids were [[03:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13511.02s)]
*  a part of the regular part of the church on Sundays and the youth events and the public [[03:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13515.7s)]
*  events. And it didn't really seem to affect any of that. [[03:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13519.74s)]
*  And her other option, you know, pulling them out and taking the church on was having these [[03:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13523.18s)]
*  kids run the streets of L.A. and be in a totally different environment. [[03:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13527.060000000001s)]
*  And so she let them stay and she didn't fight it. [[03:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13530.74s)]
*  And all six of them, her mom, her uncle, her four kids, all died at Jonestown. [[03:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13533.34s)]
*  Other members were required to demonstrate their loyalty by signing their names to the [[03:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13541.380000000001s)]
*  bottoms of blank pieces of paper, which could be filled in with confessions of vile [[03:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13545.42s)]
*  acts later if they ever turned against the temple. [[03:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13551.14s)]
*  And again, that might sound like a crazy thing to do. [[03:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13555.5s)]
*  Why would you ever agree to sign your name to something like that? [[03:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13557.58s)]
*  But again, you're in the middle of a meeting at 2 a.m. [[03:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13562.26s)]
*  surrounded by 100 people who would immediately turn hostile if you refuse to you've [[03:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13564.74s)]
*  seen beat the hell out of people. [[03:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13569.939999999999s)]
*  And anyway, this isn't really for you. [[03:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13573.099999999999s)]
*  You rationalize it, right? [[03:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13575.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'll sign it, but this isn't really for me. [[03:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13577.18s)]
*  I'm one of the loyal ones. [[03:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13579.86s)]
*  It's for those other people. [[03:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13581.58s)]
*  You know, those are the ones you have to worry about. [[03:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13582.900000000001s)]
*  Those those ones that we don't see, you know, we never know who it is and you never [[03:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13584.26s)]
*  know what they might do to turn on the rest of us. [[03:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13589.58s)]
*  So this actually protects me from their treason. [[03:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13591.380000000001s)]
*  Right. [[03:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13594.060000000001s)]
*  As far as I know, nobody ever refused to do it. [[03:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13594.58s)]
*  But still, there was only one way to make sure that people would never leave. [[03:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13599.460000000001s)]
*  And that was to make sure that leaving was impossible. [[03:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13604.26s)]
*  The power of power. [[03:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13610.7s)]
*  Comparable to Adolf Hitler. [[03:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13613.900000000001s)]
*  Is evident today in America and every phase of its life. [[03:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13616.62s)]
*  The atmosphere here is exactly like the atmosphere of Germany in 1933. [[03:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13624.62s)]
*  And I expect that a government like Adolf Hitler will happen here within the next five [[03:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13632.14s)]
*  years. [[03:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13645.06s)]
*  The state this time will be black, Mexicans and Indians. [[03:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13648.82s)]
*  As you know, Hitler murdered all of the Jews before he finished. [[03:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13654.74s)]
*  Now, that won't happen to us. [[03:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13658.22s)]
*  If you listen to me, we have plans that are laid. [[03:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13660.220000000001s)]
*  We have plans that are absolutely workable. [[03:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13664.380000000001s)]
*  That's going to take more cooperation than we now get. [[03:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13667.26s)]
*  You're going to have to make this your chief commitment. [[03:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13671.7s)]
*  So all the provisions we've got up there in the valley would be wonderful. [[03:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13678.140000000001s)]
*  But if we have a dictatorship, the valley isn't enough protection against the [[03:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13682.380000000001s)]
*  dictatorship. [[03:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13685.54s)]
*  So we've got to have a little place here and a little Shangri-La over there. [[03:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13686.18s)]
*  You know, over there. [[03:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13692.300000000001s)]
*  Some of you don't know where over there is. [[03:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13694.62s)]
*  But I do. [[03:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13697.58s)]
*  And that's good enough for you if you know me. [[03:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13698.9s)]
*  I do. [[03:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13700.82s)]
*  I know a place where I can take you, where there'll be no more racism, where [[03:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13707.06s)]
*  there'll be no more division, where there'll be no more war. [[03:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13712.26s)]
*  There'll be no more class exploitation. [[03:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13716.18s)]
*  I know just the place. [[03:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13718.460000000001s)]
*  Oh, yes, I do. [[03:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13720.82s)]
*  And you won't have to worry about getting angel wings if we get our own plane. [[03:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13729.34s)]
*  And we'd have something to bring in that would be valuable to us if we resettled. [[03:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13738.62s)]
*  So you really do think we might have to resettle? [[03:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13744.14s)]
*  The Jews should have. [[03:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13748.34s)]
*  And they just held on. [[03:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13752.019999999999s)]
*  They held on. [[03:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13753.699999999999s)]
*  They wouldn't let loose. [[03:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13754.699999999999s)]
*  They thought, oh, it can't happen to us. [[03:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13757.14s)]
*  We're God's chosen people. [[03:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13758.74s)]
*  Well, we niggers know we ain't God's chosen people. [[03:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13760.699999999999s)]
*  Jim had had the idea to escape to South America, banging around in his head since [[03:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13763.94s)]
*  the early sixties, since he had visited Guyana and Brazil during that period. [[03:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13770.34s)]
*  And since then, the temple had discussed building an agricultural settlement [[03:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13777.1s)]
*  somewhere in the Southern hemisphere as a refuge from nuclear war for some time. [[03:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13780.54s)]
*  As a refuge from nuclear war for some time. [[03:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13785.94s)]
*  In 1974, with his paranoid sense of being under siege spiking, Jim decided that now [[03:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13790.140000000001s)]
*  was the time to put those plans into action. [[03:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13798.580000000002s)]
*  And they settled on Guyana, a country on the right shoulder of South America, [[03:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13801.380000000001s)]
*  because it had a black nationalist and socialist government. [[03:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13805.140000000001s)]
*  And because its national language was English, a legacy of its history as a [[03:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13808.18s)]
*  British colony. [[03:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13812.98s)]
*  And because Guyana had been open to settlers for years, it had been trying to [[03:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13815.1s)]
*  develop the jungle interior, especially a disputed chunk of land up near the [[03:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13819.26s)]
*  Venezuelan border. [[03:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13824.02s)]
*  And the Guyanese government figured having a group of Americans up there would [[03:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13825.539999999999s)]
*  be a good way to prevent the Venezuelan army from rolling through. [[03:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13830.02s)]
*  And Guyana, it's in South America. [[03:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13837.06s)]
*  I've only spent a good amount of time and gotten to know one guy who grew up in [[03:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13839.5s)]
*  Guyana, spent most of his life there. [[03:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13843.46s)]
*  But it was enough to drive home the point that you get from reading about it, that [[03:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13845.42s)]
*  even though it's in South America and South America, you know, most Americans [[03:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13849.66s)]
*  think Latin America, Guyana is a Caribbean country. [[03:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13853.42s)]
*  The guy that I knew was like any island boy you've ever met. [[03:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13857.74s)]
*  And in some ways, Guyana is like an island. [[03:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13861.9s)]
*  Most of the population, primarily Indians brought in from India by the British [[03:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13864.46s)]
*  during colonization and Black descendants of slaves brought in during the same [[03:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13870.38s)]
*  period, they live snuggled up along the Caribbean coast. [[03:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13874.02s)]
*  And the vast majority of the rest of the country is a dense, ultra dense, triple [[03:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13877.98s)]
*  canopy jungle cut by about a million rivers and lightly inhabited by Amer [[03:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13883.78s)]
*  Indians who don't really who, you know, to be honest, I don't really know if this [[03:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13888.78s)]
*  is true now, but in the seventies didn't really figure into the country's [[03:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13892.42s)]
*  political culture. [[03:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13895.3s)]
*  So while it's not technically an island, obviously it's got ocean on one side and [[03:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13898.06s)]
*  a pretty much impenetrable jungle, an ocean of jungle on the other side. [[03:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13902.86s)]
*  And most people live in the area between the two, but it up against the beach. [[03:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13907.34s)]
*  So it's got that island feel in certain ways. [[03:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13911.42s)]
*  But that's not where Jim Jones was looking to build his colony. [[03:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13916.9s)]
*  So it wasn't going to be a, this wasn't going to be a little beach village. [[03:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13919.74s)]
*  Jonestown was going to be situated way out in that ocean of jungle, a 24 hour [[03:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13922.38s)]
*  boat ride from the main Guyanese population center, Georgetown along the [[03:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13928.98s)]
*  coast and upriver, or else you could take a plane to a nearby airstrip. [[03:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13934.46s)]
*  There was nothing but a little path of clear jungle and then be dragged by a [[03:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13938.58s)]
*  tractor the rest of the way through the muddy jungle to the, to the location. [[03:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13942.259999999998s)]
*  You could not drive there. [[03:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13946.14s)]
*  You couldn't drive there. [[03:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13947.62s)]
*  There were no roads to Jonestown. [[03:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13948.34s)]
*  I mean, this place was going to be very, very remote out among the [[03:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13950.98s)]
*  Amerindians and that was it. [[03:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13955.66s)]
*  Ghana and people's temple were a match in more ways than one. [[03:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13959.7s)]
*  Like I said, they had been open to settlers from the outside for years. [[03:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13964.42s)]
*  And believe it or not, the temple was not even the most bizarre outfit that [[03:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13967.66s)]
*  had come from America to set up shop there in recent years. [[03:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13972.300000000001s)]
*  The Nobel prize winning author, V.S. [[03:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13975.220000000001s)]
*  Naipaul and his brother, Shiva Naipaul were British Indians born in Trinidad, [[03:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13977.26s)]
*  which is maybe, I don't know, maybe 150 miles or so up and just off the coast [[03:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13981.98s)]
*  from Guyana V.S. [[03:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13987.42s)]
*  Naipaul has several really, really necessary books on the Caribbean and [[03:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13989.54s)]
*  South America. [[03:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13992.9s)]
*  They're all worth reading. [[03:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13993.58s)]
*  And Shiva, his brother, was also a very talented writer, only got off a few [[03:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13994.74s)]
*  books before he had an early heart attack and an early stroke. [[03:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=13999.82s)]
*  A few books before he had an early heart attack and passed away. [[03:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14002.78s)]
*  But one of them was called Journey to Nowhere. [[03:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14005.86s)]
*  It was a book about Jonestown and it's a really unique book about Jonestown. [[03:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14010.1s)]
*  It's not really another one like it. [[03:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14013.38s)]
*  He wrote it shortly after the mass suicide. [[03:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14016.58s)]
*  He went down to Guyana to see the place and talk to people and investigate [[03:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14018.539999999999s)]
*  Guyana, a place that he had a lot of experience with anyway, shortly after [[03:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14023.1s)]
*  everything happened. [[03:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14027.1s)]
*  Naipaul believed that his country, Trinidad and Guyana, had been corrupted [[03:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14028.9s)]
*  by influence from the American Black Power Movement, which had radicalized [[03:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14034.34s)]
*  the black populations of the English speaking Caribbean and left behind an [[03:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14038.98s)]
*  ideology of resentment and racial power long after the white oppressors had [[03:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14044.06s)]
*  left and the only people left to exercise that power on were the Indians. [[03:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14048.94s)]
*  What did black power mean in the absence of white domination? [[03:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14052.94s)]
*  We found out in parts of the Caribbean and places like East Africa under [[03:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14057.1s)]
*  Idi Amin, who was also in power and speaking the same language at this time, [[03:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14061.060000000001s)]
*  the same language specifically against the same people, actually, the former [[03:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14066.460000000001s)]
*  British colonies in East Africa as well. [[03:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14070.460000000001s)]
*  Uganda was. [[03:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14072.300000000001s)]
*  So he's, he's, he's targeting the descendants of the Indians brought in [[03:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14073.34s)]
*  by the British, virtually all of whom in Uganda specifically, the British [[03:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14076.9s)]
*  In Uganda specifically, he either killed or exiled, even though they were the [[03:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14081.58s)]
*  ones engaged in the bulk of the professional vocations that a country [[03:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14087.380000000001s)]
*  needs in order to continue functioning at a high level. [[03:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14091.58s)]
*  The same thing happened in Guyana. [[03:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14095.98s)]
*  This is from his book, Journey to Nowhere, quote, [[03:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14100.86s)]
*  It is hardly a cause for astonishment given the history, beliefs and practices [[03:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14105.62s)]
*  of the people's temple as we now know them to have been that Jim Jones should [[03:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14109.78s)]
*  have been drawn to Guyana. [[03:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14113.62s)]
*  And it is equally astonishing that the Guyana of Forbes Burnham, the black [[03:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14115.62s)]
*  nationalist dictator of Guyana, given its history, beliefs and practices [[03:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14120.060000000001s)]
*  should have accepted him. [[03:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14125.66s)]
*  Guyana over recent years has shown a predilection for welcoming, assisting [[03:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14127.42s)]
*  and sheltering strange people, a weakness springing from a peculiar sort of [[03:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14131.78s)]
*  gangsterism that can contain within itself, both corrupt cynicism of the [[03:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14135.78s)]
*  highest order and ideological motivation. [[03:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14139.18s)]
*  You're a stupid black man, Burnham is reported to have said to the architect [[03:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14142.78s)]
*  who refused to inflate his estimates. [[03:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14146.5s)]
*  That outburst reveals the complex nature of Burnhamite gangsterism. [[03:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14149.02s)]
*  It is about being black and about being third world as well as about being rich. [[03:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14153.26s)]
*  It is a point of view within that point of view, criminality, nationalism, [[03:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14157.66s)]
*  corruption, altruism of a kind can all coexist. [[03:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14162.66s)]
*  What holds them together is the personality of the big black chief who [[03:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14166.9s)]
*  operates, so to speak, by institutionalizing his manias, lusts and fantasies. [[03:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14170.62s)]
*  This makes him and his country, which is no more than a projection of his [[03:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14176.380000000001s)]
*  caprice, vulnerable to appropriate calls from the wild. [[03:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14180.86s)]
*  When I visited in 1970, Guyana was being converted into something called a [[03:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14185.06s)]
*  cooperative socialist republic. [[03:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14189.380000000001s)]
*  At the time, no one could say for certain what that was supposed to be, [[03:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14192.02s)]
*  nor can anyone today. [[03:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14195.22s)]
*  The only concrete effect seems to have been in the field of letter writing. [[03:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14197.46s)]
*  Ministers and civil servants sign their communications, yours cooperatively. [[03:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14200.98s)]
*  Burnham, whose moderation and coolie baiting pop policy politics had so [[03:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14206.18s)]
*  appealed to his American and British sponsors, now began to discard his [[03:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14210.9s)]
*  moderation, but not his racism and pose as a third world militant. [[03:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14214.66s)]
*  Photographs started to appear of the comrade leader, as he now liked to be [[03:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14219.5s)]
*  called, dressed in Chinese influenced tunics and African dashikis. [[03:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14222.98s)]
*  At some point he had himself created a general, necessitating a further [[03:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14227.619999999999s)]
*  addition to his growing wardrobe. [[03:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14231.3s)]
*  I noted that he attended a conference on non-aligned states in Lusaka, Zambia, [[03:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14233.619999999999s)]
*  offered Guyana as a home away from home for the African freedom fighters and [[03:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14237.98s)]
*  handed over a check of $50,000 to assist in the liberation struggle. [[03:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14241.34s)]
*  And that was not all. [[03:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14245.98s)]
*  In 1971, a dope dealer from Bermuda came to Guyana to drum up support for a [[03:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14247.42s)]
*  so-called black people's Congress. [[03:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14252.26s)]
*  The government obliged with a handout. [[03:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14254.74s)]
*  However, years later, the black people's Congress has yet to take place. [[03:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14256.94s)]
*  Then there was the man who claimed to be an Angolan freedom fighter. [[03:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14261.02s)]
*  He was honored with Guyanese citizenship. [[03:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14264.300000000001s)]
*  It turned out that he was an American in flight from the police. [[03:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14266.82s)]
*  Like the Bermudan, he was also involved in the dope trade. [[03:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14270.02s)]
*  These were not isolated pieces of bad luck. [[03:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14273.42s)]
*  The Bermudan and the pseudo Angolan belonged to a common pattern of vaguely [[03:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14276.06s)]
*  ideological misadventures. [[03:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14279.86s)]
*  Consider a man named Michael Defredis, otherwise known as Abdul Malik, [[03:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14281.94s)]
*  otherwise known as Michael X. [[03:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14286.18s)]
*  In London, he peddled dope and worked as a strong arm man for a slum landlord. [[03:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14288.66s)]
*  He became a convert to Islam and black power. [[03:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14293.26s)]
*  Eventually, his rabble rousing led to trouble with the English police. [[03:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14296.34s)]
*  He fled home to Trinidad. [[03:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14300.14s)]
*  In Trinidad, subsidized by his rich English patrons, he started an agricultural [[03:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14301.619999999999s)]
*  commune, a climaxed in murder. [[03:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14306.34s)]
*  He was sentenced to death. [[03:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14309.18s)]
*  Sitting in jail, Michael X was suckered by Tom Wicker of the New York Times, [[03:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14310.820000000002s)]
*  the New Statesman and other foreign friends of the oppressed. [[03:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14314.86s)]
*  According to the Angela Davis Defense Committee, Malik's only crime was his [[03:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14318.1s)]
*  commitment to the world movement for peace and justice. [[03:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14322.220000000001s)]
*  It was absolutely necessary, they went on, that he be allowed to continue his [[03:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14325.42s)]
*  work for peace, justice and progress on behalf of all oppressed people in the world. [[03:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14328.86s)]
*  Too often, those who ought to know better, nourish our crazy dreams of [[03:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14333.820000000002s)]
*  resurrection and redemption, those safely beyond the borders of our [[03:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14338.46s)]
*  madness underwrite our lunacies. [[03:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14342.46s)]
*  After he had committed murder on his Trinidad commune, it was to Guyana [[03:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14347.099999999999s)]
*  that Michael X had fled. [[03:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14351.019999999999s)]
*  There, he was met at the airport by a minister of government and given [[03:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14353.14s)]
*  the red carpet treatment. [[03:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14356.339999999998s)]
*  The state owned Chronicle published a photograph of the minister and his [[03:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14358.099999999999s)]
*  guests, gazing deeply into each other's eyes. [[03:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14361.099999999999s)]
*  Beneath the photograph was the caption, when two revolutionaries meet. [[03:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14363.22s)]
*  Less controversial perhaps, but equally revealing of the mood of [[03:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14368.5s)]
*  Guyanese hospitality was the visit of the American black power activist [[03:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14372.179999999998s)]
*  and theorist Stokely Carmichael. [[03:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14376.3s)]
*  He had originally been invited to Guyana by a dissident group of academics and [[03:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14378.779999999999s)]
*  students, but they quickly dissociated themselves from him when they heard the [[03:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14382.339999999998s)]
*  sort of things he was saying. [[03:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14385.74s)]
*  All the talk was of bloodshed and fighting, a member of the group said to me. [[03:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14387.82s)]
*  He said black power meant African power. [[03:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14391.98s)]
*  He said we had to learn how to kill. [[03:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14394.539999999999s)]
*  It was the wrong message for a place like Guyana. [[03:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14396.859999999999s)]
*  We had had enough of racial killing by then. [[03:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14399.38s)]
*  Carmichael was not left either embarrassed or marooned by their hasty desertion. [[04:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14402.46s)]
*  He was quickly picked up by the people's national Congress and like Michael X [[04:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14406.66s)]
*  given the red carpet treatment by the Guyanese government, the New York Times [[04:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14410.539999999999s)]
*  reporting from Georgetown stated that there were at least four Americans wanted [[04:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14415.22s)]
*  back at home for an assortment of crimes, rape, murder, armed robbery, blackmail, [[04:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14419.099999999999s)]
*  who were living in Guyana under government protection. [[04:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14425.06s)]
*  One of these had been made a senior training official in one of the security [[04:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14428.26s)]
*  services, but the most notorious of prime minister Burnham's criminal courtiers is [[04:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14431.78s)]
*  a black preacher from Tennessee calling himself rabbi Washington back home where [[04:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14436.58s)]
*  he is known as David Hill. [[04:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14441.9s)]
*  He is wanted by police on charges of blackmail and violence, but in Guyana, [[04:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14443.46s)]
*  where he surfaced in 1972, he is a figure of consequence. [[04:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14447.7s)]
*  He has created around himself a religious sect, the house of Israel, which espouses [[04:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14451.859999999999s)]
*  a messianic doctrine of black redemption. [[04:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14456.5s)]
*  His Guyanese followers adorn themselves in the colors of the ruling party, which [[04:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14459.179999999998s)]
*  also happened to be the national colors. [[04:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14462.98s)]
*  They arrived by the busload to take part in government sponsored rallies and parades. [[04:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14465.5s)]
*  They helped to break up opposition meetings in a sugar strike called by a [[04:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14469.939999999999s)]
*  union unfriendly to the government. [[04:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14474.019999999999s)]
*  They played the part of scab labor. [[04:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14475.619999999999s)]
*  The rabbi lives in considerable style. [[04:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14478.099999999999s)]
*  His benefactors have in addition provided his organization with two farms. [[04:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14480.58s)]
*  The house of Israel calls itself Burnham's church. [[04:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14485.34s)]
*  It has even included him in its theology. [[04:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14488.42s)]
*  The comrade leader is Moses. [[04:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14490.74s)]
*  The rabbi is Aaron. [[04:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14492.779999999999s)]
*  There was nothing extraordinary therefore in the warm welcome extended by the [[04:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14494.779999999999s)]
*  Guyanese government to Jim Jones and to his people, agricultural communes staffed [[04:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14499.38s)]

*  The people's temple was not even the only agricultural commune in the Northwest. [[04:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14511.9s)]
*  There was a similar agricultural project getting underway in 1974, not far from [[04:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14516.380000000001s)]
*  the Naysanth Jones town. [[04:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14520.86s)]
*  This other project also staffed by Americans was called Shalom. [[04:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14522.34s)]
*  It was having financial problems and had made little progress in clearing [[04:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14526.58s)]
*  and cultivating its tract. [[04:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14529.98s)]
*  Shalom's residents seem to be composed mainly of remnants from the hippie movement [[04:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14531.86s)]
*  of the 1960s and are rumored to have been primarily engaged in cultivating [[04:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14535.9s)]
*  marijuana. [[04:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14539.94s)]
*  End quote. [[04:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14541.66s)]
*  And so now, as, as Naipaul said, although Forbes Burnham had come to power in [[04:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14544.42s)]
*  Guyana with the assistance of the CIA and British intelligence, who in the [[04:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14548.38s)]

*  Marxist named Chetty Yagan, by the early 1970s, Burnham had fully embraced this [[04:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14564.14s)]
*  new revolutionary identity and totally consolidated power himself. [[04:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14570.22s)]
*  And Guyana in the meantime, declined precipitously under his rule. [[04:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14575.779999999999s)]
*  As a result of the corruption and mismanagement of his government, the [[04:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14581.699999999999s)]

*  whole country being everywhere planted with sugar cane, because what sugar was [[04:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14619.62s)]

*  Street crime and begging were general in Georgetown. [[04:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14637.1s)]
*  In Georgetown, hospitals were always short of drugs, basic drugs and basic [[04:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14640.34s)]
*  supplies fields went fallow because there were no parts to repair broken down [[04:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14645.74s)]
*  tractors and these opulent colonial mansions had been stripped of their [[04:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14650.539999999999s)]
*  expensive doorknobs and faucets and other fixtures in the peeling paint and [[04:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14655.46s)]
*  the sweltering heat contributed to this overall feeling of oppressive decay. [[04:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14660.699999999999s)]
*  Nipol writes, quote, despite the warnings of guards, I decided that I would walk [[04:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14666.7s)]
*  back to my hotel alone. [[04:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14671.900000000001s)]
*  It was the middle of the afternoon and it was hot. [[04:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14674.140000000001s)]
*  Georgetown and its inhabitants looked derelict. [[04:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14677.1s)]
*  The shuttered shops were uninviting, starved of goods. [[04:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14679.980000000001s)]
*  Sullen black faces stared out of the doorways of rum shops and cafes. [[04:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14683.980000000001s)]
*  Others gathered in small groups and patches of shade. [[04:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14688.460000000001s)]
*  Watch me without friendliness. [[04:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14691.34s)]
*  There was little traffic about. [[04:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14692.900000000001s)]
*  I was rather foolishly wearing a jacket and carrying a briefcase, two items that [[04:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14694.300000000001s)]
*  clearly marked me out for attention. [[04:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14699.02s)]
*  That as well as the heat and the humidity of the afternoon made me regret my [[04:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14701.34s)]
*  decision to walk, but there was not a taxi in sight. [[04:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14705.74s)]
*  Racks of refuse floated in stagnant gutters, smells of decay hung in the still air. [[04:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14709.94s)]
*  Solitary beggars slept in the shadows of peeling paint and the smell of [[04:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14716.94s)]
*  beggars slept in the shadows of peeling buildings. [[04:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14720.94s)]
*  I began to feel that the city itself was rotting away slowly in the suffocating heat. [[04:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14724.7s)]
*  Walls were covered with faded referendum posters and scrawled in graffiti. [[04:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14730.82s)]
*  Vote yes. [[04:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14735.34s)]
*  End exploitation now. [[04:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14736.42s)]
*  Burnham is king. [[04:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14738.5s)]
*  We have Burnham fever. [[04:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14740.02s)]
*  Away from the center of the city, I came to quieter, cleaner streets. [[04:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14743.62s)]
*  Elegant white painted wooden houses stood silent in bushy gardens. [[04:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14747.78s)]
*  These colonial houses are the glory of Georgetown. [[04:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14752.54s)]
*  Looking at them, I could see why it was once reputed a beautiful city, but now [[04:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14755.300000000001s)]
*  their elegance was faded and many had been converted into offices of one kind or [[04:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14760.26s)]
*  another, and their beauty was sad and elegiac, serving only to emphasize the [[04:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14764.82s)]
*  sense of disintegration. [[04:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14769.460000000001s)]
*  The air freshened as I approached the sea. [[04:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14772.02s)]
*  Families and courting couples strolled along the esplanade or sat on benches [[04:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14774.619999999999s)]
*  embedded in the concrete, facing into the salty wind and gazing into mud laden [[04:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14778.74s)]
*  breakers. [[04:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14783.1s)]
*  Soon I was having my first glimpse of the Georgetown suburbs. [[04:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14785.22s)]
*  For mile upon mile, the seawall was daubed with referendum slogans. [[04:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14788.779999999999s)]
*  Indeed, slogans and posters seem to cover every available surface. [[04:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14793.06s)]
*  Even I noticed cowsheds and the tops of water towers. [[04:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14796.66s)]
*  One stood out. [[04:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14800.46s)]
*  We will die for Burnham. [[04:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14802.019999999999s)]
*  That I gathered was the handiwork of dissident students who in the dead of [[04:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14804.46s)]
*  night had been dragged out of their dormitories at gunpoint and brought to [[04:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14808.939999999999s)]
*  the seawall. [[04:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14812.019999999999s)]
*  The entire countryside had been defaced and disfigured. [[04:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14814.26s)]
*  It defied comprehension. [[04:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14818.1s)]
*  Each splash of blood red paint seemed designed to obliterate a little more [[04:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14820.539999999999s)]
*  reason, a little more intelligence. [[04:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14824.619999999999s)]
*  Day and night for weeks on end, some savage instinct had been at work. [[04:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14827.9s)]
*  This vandalized landscape was its monument. [[04:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14832.14s)]
*  I stared at flooded wasted fields at ragged boys, tending ragged cattle at [[04:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14835.58s)]
*  broken down houses and huts to my left, the Brown ocean held at bay by the [[04:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14840.9s)]
*  seawall, glinted and gleaned. [[04:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14846.5s)]
*  End quote. [[04:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14848.699999999999s)]
*  Naipaul writes that as a result of this degradation, emigration from Guyana [[04:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14851.46s)]
*  had become a stampede for the exits. [[04:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14858.5s)]
*  This had happened in many of these post-colonial areas up in that area in [[04:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14861.5s)]
*  Suriname, for example, there's an old joke, possibly apocryphal that he [[04:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14865.14s)]
*  reports that people would tell in Suriname that there was a sign at the [[04:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14870.779999999999s)]

*  In just the last few recent years before he was writing this over 50,000 people [[04:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14882.74s)]
*  had left Guyana, but that's out of a total population of just 800,000. [[04:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14888.02s)]
*  So it's a big chunk of the population. [[04:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14892.220000000001s)]
*  And the people who were leaving were typically the most educated and capable [[04:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14895.5s)]
*  people. [[04:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14899.140000000001s)]
*  These are the people who could afford to, you know, put their families on a plane [[04:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14899.5s)]
*  and emigrate to another country. [[04:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14903.980000000001s)]
*  Workers went on strikes, but they were beaten, jailed and sometimes worse by the [[04:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14907.980000000001s)]

*  Israel. [[04:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14916.58s)]
*  Rule of law was virtually nonexistent and people's only protection came from [[04:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14917.82s)]
*  their status or connections to the government. [[04:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14922.74s)]
*  Any last traces of political freedom had been wiped away by a fraudulent [[04:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14926.539999999999s)]
*  constitutional referendum, pushed through by Burnham in the middle of the decade, [[04:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14931.46s)]
*  which reduced the government to a mere organ of his party. [[04:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14935.02s)]
*  And the party was itself a mere organ of his own will. [[04:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14939.18s)]
*  Naipaul writes, quote, [[04:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14943.380000000001s)]
*  An old friend from school days was dejected and defeated. [[04:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14945.98s)]
*  I've gone into internal exile, he said. [[04:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14950.26s)]
*  We were sitting in a cafe that tried to do things nicely. [[04:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14953.460000000001s)]
*  It was furnished with bent wood chairs and decorated with Aubrey Beardsley [[04:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14956.62s)]
*  posters. [[04:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14959.98s)]
*  Across the way was the Queens Park Savannah, a dark, unkempt presence. [[04:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14961.300000000001s)]
*  I think we're all a little mad now, he said. [[04:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14966.62s)]
*  He wanted to go away, put his thoughts together. [[04:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14969.66s)]
*  Maybe write something, but he didn't have the money. [[04:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14972.18s)]
*  He had reached a dead end and he was afraid for himself. [[04:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14976.74s)]
*  During the last few years, he had been politically active. [[04:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14980.14s)]
*  His party, intellectual to a fault and moderate in its message, had had [[04:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14983.02s)]
*  marginal impact. [[04:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14987.06s)]
*  He had been left stranded with his idealism. [[04:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14988.78s)]
*  I think of another friend now approaching middle age. [[04:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14992.06s)]
*  What is the world? [[04:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14995.380000000001s)]
*  He asked. [[04:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14996.300000000001s)]
*  He answered his own question. [[04:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14997.460000000001s)]
*  It is a mental construction. [[04:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=14999.14s)]
*  The world we perceive with our senses is not the only one there is, or even [[04:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15001.26s)]
*  the most important one. [[04:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15004.78s)]
*  It is an illusion. [[04:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15006.380000000001s)]
*  I listened as he talked about the many levels of being. [[04:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15008.54s)]
*  I've experienced Krishna consciousness, he said. [[04:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15012.1s)]
*  I know what it is to be dead. [[04:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15015.58s)]
*  Death too is an illusion. [[04:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15016.94s)]
*  His soft, mulatto eyes were clear and steady. [[04:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15019.900000000001s)]
*  Once we used to have long discussions about Marxism, about the revolution [[04:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15023.26s)]
*  that would transform the Caribbean. [[04:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15027.820000000002s)]
*  One day, he said, I was sitting in my garden when something like a nuclear [[04:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15030.22s)]
*  explosion seemed to occur inside my head. [[04:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15034.06s)]
*  There was light everywhere. [[04:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15036.98s)]
*  No one could approach him. [[04:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15038.5s)]
*  It was as if a magnetic force fenced him in, keeping people away. [[04:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15039.699999999999s)]
*  He stood for hours in his garden, bathed in light. [[04:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15043.34s)]
*  Now his wife gone, he lives alone. [[04:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15046.859999999999s)]
*  His house is gradually falling into ruin. [[04:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15050.699999999999s)]
*  Weeds sprout in the garden. [[04:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15053.9s)]
*  Walls, creak, flake and crack. [[04:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15055.9s)]
*  His books collect mold and dust. [[04:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15059.5s)]
*  I am at peace, he said. [[04:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15063.38s)]
*  And so at a certain point, as Naipaul's walking around, he picks up a local [[04:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15068.34s)]
*  walking companion who offers to show him around and invites to take offers to [[04:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15071.66s)]
*  take him to a golf tournament. [[04:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15075.859999999999s)]
*  And Naipaul's there as a journalist, so he's not going to turn down a local [[04:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15078.099999999999s)]
*  guide and so the two men are walking together. [[04:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15080.779999999999s)]
*  I did not care for my companion. [[04:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15085.06s)]
*  I was a little wary of the attention he had been paying me during the last few [[04:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15087.18s)]
*  days, offering to take me everywhere, obsequiously placing himself at my [[04:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15090.26s)]

*  I had grown to dislike his narrow, shiny face, his pinched lips, his spiky, [[04:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15098.42s)]
*  yellowing teeth. [[04:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15102.740000000002s)]

*  His voice was simultaneously rasping and wheedling. [[04:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15111.5s)]

*  Man, he said to me the first time we met, you have to have the ability to [[04:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15119.9s)]
*  get on with all kinds. [[04:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15124.34s)]

*  We continued our walk to the golf course. [[04:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15137.779999999999s)]
*  You're paying the hotel and foreign currency, not so? [[04:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15140.46s)]
*  He inquired. [[04:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15143.14s)]
*  I looked at the narrow, bony face, at the spiky teeth, bared an [[04:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15144.66s)]

*  It doesn't make sense. [[04:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15153.42s)]

*  I should have thought of it before, but it's only this morning it hit me. [[04:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15157.34s)]
*  I thought, poor bastard, how they must be ripping him off at the hotel. [[04:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15160.3s)]
*  You understand me? [[04:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15164.3s)]

*  He glanced at me out of the corner of his eye, a caricature of petty crookedness. [[04:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15168.9s)]
*  Reaching into his jacket pocket, he took out a fat roll of Guyanese dollar bills [[04:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15174.699999999999s)]
*  tied with a rubber band. [[04:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15178.46s)]
*  He tossed it into my lap. [[04:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15179.82s)]
*  I returned the money to him. [[04:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15181.98s)]
*  I had to sign a currency declaration form when I came in. [[04:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15184.099999999999s)]
*  Sure, sure, but you didn't tell them the whole amount, I bet. [[04:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15187.019999999999s)]
*  He winked at me. [[04:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15190.619999999999s)]
*  I did. [[04:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15191.859999999999s)]
*  That won't make problems for you. [[04:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15193.699999999999s)]
*  If they try anything, just grease their palms a little. [[04:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15194.98s)]
*  He laughed. [[04:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15197.42s)]
*  How calmly he treated the prospect of my getting into difficulties. [[04:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15198.619999999999s)]
*  He tried again to give me the roll of bills. [[04:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15202.699999999999s)]
*  Again, I gave it back. [[04:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15204.58s)]
*  Think about it. [[04:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15205.86s)]
*  No. [[04:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15206.98s)]
*  He replaced the money in his pocket, setting his face away from me. [[04:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15208.86s)]
*  What upset me was not that he wanted my foreign currency. [[04:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15213.06s)]
*  That was natural enough in a country like Guyana. [[04:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15215.58s)]
*  It was the completeness of his corruption, his degeneracy. [[04:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15218.46s)]
*  He was an exhalation of the moral decay that I could sense all around me. [[04:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15222.26s)]
*  The society had robbed him of his humanity. [[04:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15226.98s)]
*  It allowed virtually no one to be fully human. [[04:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15229.58s)]
*  I remembered the passengers on the aircraft who had plundered the toilets. [[04:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15232.9s)]
*  The man mirrored his country. [[04:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15236.82s)]
*  We left the coast road turning inland. [[04:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15239.5s)]
*  Soon we were surrounded by sugarcane fields. [[04:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15242.26s)]
*  Irrigation canals reflected the sky. [[04:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15245.02s)]
*  The asphalt was crumbling and potholed. [[04:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15247.5s)]
*  After about a mile or so, the paved road turned into an uneven dirt track. [[04:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15250.380000000001s)]
*  This was an Indian area and therefore even more neglected. [[04:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15255.300000000001s)]
*  In Guyana, lines of relatively neat brick houses and properly paved roads [[04:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15258.94s)]
*  invariably signal a colony of government supporters. [[04:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15263.380000000001s)]
*  Half-naked children played in muddy ditches. [[04:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15267.300000000001s)]
*  Many of them would attend school irregularly, economic assets too valuable to squander. [[04:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15270.14s)]
*  Old men reclined in hammocks slung under the houses. [[04:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15275.86s)]
*  Women squatted in the muddy yards, scrubbing pots and pans. [[04:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15279.380000000001s)]
*  We moved slowly, gingerly negotiating the roads treacheries. [[04:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15282.7s)]
*  Mangy dogs yapped in our wake. [[04:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15286.62s)]
*  The golf course, a relic of the displaced planter regime, was set amidst the cane fields. [[04:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15290.02s)]
*  Before the sugar estates were nationalized, the road leading to it had been well maintained. [[04:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15295.94s)]
*  Since then, nature had been given a free hand. [[04:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15300.740000000002s)]
*  Mr. Burnham does not play golf and its deterioration had been swift. [[04:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15303.820000000002s)]
*  Golf and those who played it had been in the hands of the people who played it. [[04:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15308.7s)]
*  Golf and those who played it had no place in a society that was moving inexorably towards socialism, went the party line. [[04:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15311.7s)]
*  It seemed to be only a matter of time before the golf course, marooned in what had become a rural slum, [[04:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15317.94s)]
*  followed the Georgetown Turf Club into extinction. [[04:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15323.58s)]
*  The clubhouse was a modest wooden pavilion. [[04:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15327.18s)]
*  Gathered here with their aging cars and their children, nearly all the children were infants. [[04:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15330.34s)]
*  Most of the older ones were safely abroad, were the remnants of the Guyanese middle class. [[04:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15335.1s)]
*  Ruin people in a ruin setting, seeking after pleasures which could no longer be found, pretending to enjoy themselves. [[04:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15340.58s)]
*  End quote. [[04:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15348.82s)]
*  It was an appropriate place for people's temple to go to die. [[04:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15352.5s)]
*  The government was corrupt. [[04:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15357.58s)]
*  Virtually anyone could be compromised. [[04:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15359.62s)]
*  The prime minister was trying to carve out an identity as a revolutionary, opposing the power of the United States. [[04:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15363.42s)]
*  And since all power flowed from his person, all you had to do was keep that one guy happy. [[04:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15368.98s)]
*  And since most of Jim's followers were black and he knew how to speak the language of the aspiring black revolutionaries running Guyana, he was confident that he could do that. [[04:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15374.539999999999s)]
*  Guyana in the 1970s resembled the crash landing site of the whole Third World Revolution. [[04:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15385.46s)]
*  After it moved on from its demands for inclusion in the developed world in favor of a racial narcissism that recreated different versions of the caste systems that they'd escaped. [[04:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15393.5s)]
*  And a racial entitlement that used paranoia and resentment to justify every variety of corruption and failure. [[04:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15404.7s)]
*  This was the failed revolution after the storms of violence and white hot emotions had faded. [[04:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15412.5s)]
*  With people in charge who had ridden that emotional wave to power, who knew how to give a speech and thrust a fist in the air, but had no idea how to run a government and no real intention of trying to learn. [[04:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15417.82s)]
*  Nipaw and his brother, who again were of Indian descent from people who were brought to the Caribbean to be a service class to the British colonizers, had watched the region change in a matter of a few years and the change was often inspired by the United States. [[04:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15430.38s)]
*  As black power ideology caught fire in the US, it spread to the English speaking Caribbean, but in those countries there was no vast white power structure to raise your fist against. [[04:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15445.7s)]
*  In Guyana, the population was about 40% black and the rest were descendants of Indians like the Nipaws and then a handful of indigenous Amerindians who again weren't weren't really politically involved at the time. [[04:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15458.220000000001s)]
*  So black power meant something very different over there than it meant in the United States where you had white mobs blocking off voting booths in Montgomery, Alabama. [[04:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15470.46s)]
*  In these places what it ended up meaning was black domination of the Indian population and it often got very, very ugly, very violent. [[04:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15480.46s)]
*  More often than not the racial oppression taking place in these countries got financial and media support from places like the United States where you had people with a Pavlovian, we tend to be kind of solipsistic in the West and in the United States for sure. [[04:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15490.46s)]
*  These people, these good liberals in the United States would have a Pavlovian positive reaction when they see a black leader shouting black power and denouncing colonialism even though the colonizers had left and black power had come to mean oppression of the Indians. [[04:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15499.46s)]
*  And it wasn't actually wasn't just the liberals in America. [[04:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15513.46s)]
*  Like I said, Burnham came to power with the help of the CIA because a little country divided by racial strife was preferable to one united by a Marxist government. [[04:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15516.46s)]
*  Well, you know, it's not that the political parties were the only ones that were able to do that. [[04:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15527.46s)]
*  Well, given the poverty and corruption endemic to the country, no drawn out explanation is needed to understand why the government of Guyana jumped at the chance to invite this flashy American promising to spend $2 million in initial investment to develop a contested region of their country. [[04:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15531.46s)]
*  But even still, that's not the whole story. [[04:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15550.46s)]
*  It was more than the big pocketbook Jim was waving around that helped get him legitimacy with the Guyanese government. [[04:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15552.46s)]
*  He had he had backup. [[04:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15558.46s)]
*  He had help. [[04:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15559.46s)]
*  California's Lieutenant Governor Mervyn Dimely, an immigrant to the U.S. from Trinidad himself, went with Jim on a trip to the U.S. and he was there to help him get back to power. [[04:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15560.46s)]
*  This endorsement from the Lieutenant Governor of a U.S. state with a GDP more than 400 times that of Guyana and a population more than 20 times that of Guyana, it carried weight. [[04:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15570.46s)]
*  And it was a very, very big deal. [[04:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15579.46s)]
*  And it was a very big deal. [[04:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15581.46s)]
*  And it was a very, very big deal. [[04:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15583.46s)]
*  And I think that's why he was able to get back to power. [[04:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15585.46s)]
*  And I think that's why he was able to get back to power. [[04:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15587.46s)]
*  This endorsement from the Lieutenant Governor of a U.S. state with a GDP more than 400 times that of Guyana and a population more than 20 times that of Guyana, it carried weight. [[04:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15590.46s)]
*  The fact that the Lieutenant Governor of California was willing to do something like that, get on a plane and go do that on behalf of Jim Jones, a demonstration of how much Jim's influence had grown. [[04:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15602.46s)]
*  Since moving to San Francisco in 72, Jim had been uncharacteristically cautious as he felt his way into the Bay Area political scene. [[04:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15616.46s)]
*  But by 1975, he was feeling confident enough to begin making plays. [[04:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15625.46s)]
*  So when it became clear that Ronald Reagan, who was governor at the time, planned to move on from the governorship to national politics, he was getting ready to run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976, [[04:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15631.46s)]
*  Willie Brown, who was the governor of, or rather the mayor of San Francisco at the time, and a friend of Jim Jones, was the prohibitive favorite to replace Reagan as governor. [[04:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15644.46s)]
*  And so the Bay Area's other rising Democratic stars, George Moscone and Dianne Feinstein, prepared to run for mayor of San Francisco. [[04:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15652.46s)]
*  George Moscone won the primary, and in December, he had, December of 75, he had a runoff election coming up against the Republican candidate. [[04:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15661.46s)]
*  And the race was expected to be very close. San Francisco is a very different city in 1975 than it is now. [[04:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15670.46s)]
*  So it's expected to be close. And, you know, local politics is a low turnout affair anyway. [[04:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15678.46s)]
*  Even big city races are often decided by a few hundred or a few thousand votes. [[04:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15682.46s)]
*  And you got this guy, Jim Jones, who's realizing that he commands an army of thousands of people who will show up to rallies, who will serve as campaign volunteers, and who will vote exactly as he tells them to do. [[04:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15687.46s)]
*  And so a deal was cut, and the temple turned out hundreds of volunteers in the lead up to the election. [[04:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15704.46s)]
*  They were enthusiastic and photogenic at rallies. They would show up in buses on short notice. [[04:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15711.46s)]
*  Got something coming up, you got an event, or there's an event now and not enough people showed up and it doesn't look good for the cameras, just give Jim a call. [[04:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15717.46s)]
*  They would pour in on buses wherever and whenever their assigned slate of candidates needed them. [[04:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15725.46s)]
*  And they would, and they looked good on TV and on camera. [[04:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15732.46s)]
*  It was because it was a deliberate mix of white, black, young, old, male, female, and they're all well dressed and enthusiastic and carrying prepared signs. [[04:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15736.46s)]
*  You had legions of temple members who were assigned to spend day and night writing thousands of letters a day by hand to registered voters to encourage them to vote for Moscow and other Democrats. [[04:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15746.46s)]
*  In the days before the election, hundreds of temple volunteers were going through black neighborhoods, putting flyers everywhere, knocking on doors and talking to people, taking down the names of anybody who might need help getting to a polling station. [[04:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15758.46s)]
*  And on Election Day, the temple building was used as a staging area for Moscow campaign workers and the temples big fleet of Greyhound buses was rolled out to pick people up and drive them to the polls and then drop them back off at home when they done their civic duty. [[04:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15774.46s)]
*  Moscow and Jim actually had one meeting where they went through voter information to find people who lived outside of San Francisco, even as far as Los Angeles, but who were still eligible for one reason or another to vote in San Francisco. [[04:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15789.46s)]
*  And Jim sent several buses down to bring them up north to vote and then return them back to whatever city they lived in. [[04:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15803.46s)]
*  I mean, if you're talking about when you're talking about local politics, this isn't going to make a big difference in a presidential election. [[04:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15811.46s)]
*  But I mean, it's really hard overstate how powerful this made somebody like Jim in city politics. [[04:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15820.46s)]
*  This is from Jeff Gwynne. [[04:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15828.46s)]
*  The mayor of the temple tilted the balance in favor of Muskoen. [[04:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15858.46s)]
*  Both the mayor-elect and his defeated opponent knew it. [[04:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15862.46s)]
*  Barbara Gallotta demanded a recount, which only gained him a few dozen more votes. [[04:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15865.46s)]
*  Afterward, Barbara Gallotta charged that members of the people's temple, among other unregistered voters, had cast fraudulent ballots for Muskoen and called for a thorough investigation. [[04:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15870.46s)]
*  Stone's in the temple had not only worked on behalf of Muskoen, but for the successful election of Joseph Friedus as district attorney, too. [[04:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15880.46s)]
*  Friedus and his staff, which soon included as a new hire temple lawyer, Tim Stone, duly investigated and reported no wrongdoing. [[04:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15888.46s)]
*  But Stone in his memoir later said that there actually was no investigation. [[04:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15897.46s)]
*  A San Francisco city attorney at the time named Ken Harrington. [[04:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15904.46s)]
*  He was a guy who liked George Muskoen. [[04:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15908.46s)]
*  He was a supporter, described him as down to earth and the only mayor who would roll up his sleeves and just bullshit about a ballgame, he said. [[04:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15910.46s)]
*  So he liked him, but he's very direct about what happened. [[04:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15917.46s)]
*  He says they stole the election. [[04:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15919.46s)]
*  He agrees that the temple helped in legitimate ways, providing Election Day volunteers and so forth. [[04:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15921.46s)]
*  But he said the general thinking was that they got a bunch of people to vote who weren't proper electors in the city. [[04:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15927.46s)]
*  That was the general consensus. [[04:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15932.46s)]
*  And years later, former members admitted that the temple had fraudulently registered out of town members at addresses scattered throughout the city and then bus them in to vote for Muskoen and the rest of the slate. [[04:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15934.46s)]
*  Although Tim Stone denies that that happened. [[04:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15947.46s)]
*  But, you know, who knows? [[04:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15950.46s)]
*  I mean, it would open him up to to legal action if it had happened. [[04:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15953.46s)]
*  So hard to say. [[04:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15957.46s)]
*  In any case, Jim was feeling his oats now. [[04:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15961.46s)]
*  As far as he was concerned, he had gotten the mayor of San Francisco elected. [[04:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15965.46s)]
*  As far as a lot of people were concerned. [[04:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15970.46s)]
*  And so Jim expected appointments to positions in the city government, not only for himself, but for members of his church. [[04:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15973.46s)]
*  And he felt jilted when those calls didn't come right away. [[04:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15979.46s)]
*  Grace Stone remembered we put 500 people on the street within an hour leafletting from Moscow. [[04:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15984.46s)]
*  We had money. We had numbers. [[04:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15991.46s)]
*  And when Moscow won, we were in a planning commission meeting and Jim was livid because he hadn't gotten a call from him with a job. [[04:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=15993.46s)]
*  And it was like two thirty in the morning. [[04:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16000.46s)]
*  He says, get that guy on the phone right now. [[04:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16002.46s)]
*  I say, but it's too. I don't care if it's two thirty in the morning. [[04:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16005.46s)]
*  You get that guy on the phone. [[04:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16007.46s)]
*  And so a short time later, they did it. [[04:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16010.46s)]
*  And a short time later, calling the new mayor of San Francisco two thirty in the morning to badger him about why he hasn't gotten a call about a job. [[04:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16013.46s)]
*  But a short time later, he's appointed to San Francisco's Human Rights Commission. [[04:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16020.46s)]
*  And when that didn't satisfy him, the mayor gave him a position on the board of the San Francisco Housing Authority. [[04:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16025.46s)]
*  And that suited Jones just fine. [[04:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16031.46s)]
*  The Housing Authority was the agency that oversaw all public housing projects in the city, which meant that Jim would be overseeing and exercising power over the temples, ripest recruiting grounds in the whole city. [[04:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16035.46s)]
*  The San Francisco political scene was not ready for Jim Jones. [[04:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16051.46s)]
*  This is from Tim Ryderman. [[04:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16054.46s)]
*  Before Jones's arrival, Housing Authority meetings had been dull, poorly attended affairs. [[04:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16056.46s)]
*  After Jones, the meetings became spirited public rallies. [[04:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16061.46s)]
*  Jones bust in his own cheering section. [[04:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16065.46s)]
*  They applauded him wildly, no matter what he said, whether it was a call to end corruption, a promise to improve the living conditions of the inner city poor, a vow to tighten the expense accounts of the agency staff. [[04:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16067.46s)]
*  The meetings became so jammed by Jones entourage that the sessions were moved across town to larger quarters. [[04:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16078.46s)]
*  Though the agency had its own police, temple guards patrolled watching doorways roving through meetings. [[04:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16085.46s)]
*  They even barred anyone from using the bathroom while Jones occupied it. [[04:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16091.46s)]
*  Commissioner Jones worked with the same dedication he displayed in temple endeavors and soon became chairman of the body, thanks to lobbying by Muscone's office. [[04:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16095.46s)]
*  He came to his first meeting as chairman equipped with the parliamentary procedure reference book. [[04:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16103.46s)]
*  The agenda and his own remarks were outlined with the meticulousness of a Tim Stone. [[04:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16108.46s)]
*  Jones became a public voice for the rights of minorities and of the poor. [[04:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16113.46s)]
*  He also built political and personal alliances from the highest levels of administration to a tenants organization. [[04:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16117.46s)]
*  End quote. [[04:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16124.46s)]
*  One of Jim's very closest political allies was Harvey Milk, who was a rising star in Bay Area politics at the time. [[04:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16126.46s)]
*  The two men became very close. [[04:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16134.46s)]
*  Harvey Milk had once been a closeted gay Republican teaching high school math, but really came into his own. [[04:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16137.46s)]
*  He was transformed by a long term relationship that he had had with a teenage drug dealer and male prostitute named Joe Campbell. [[04:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16143.46s)]
*  And in many ways found a kindred spirit in Jim Jones. [[04:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16152.46s)]
*  Both men were not afraid to take aggressive stands on controversial issues. [[04:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16157.46s)]
*  And yet that tendency, that fearlessness that both of them had, part of it was because both men liked to fight and both men had their demons. [[04:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16163.46s)]
*  Milk is a revered figure, obviously, in LGBT politics for taking strong public stands at a time when that was not as easy to do as it is today. [[04:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16172.46s)]
*  But he led a very tumultuous personal life. [[04:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16183.46s)]
*  When Milk was 33 years old, he began a live in relationship with a 16 year old runaway to whom he doubled as a sex partner and a sort of father figure. [[04:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16186.46s)]
*  And it was a sort of it was sort of a pattern with him. [[04:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16198.46s)]
*  The two were together for a very rocky five or six year relationship during which the boy abused drugs and alcohol and tried to commit suicide at least three times. [[04:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16201.46s)]
*  One of the times Milk came home and found him and had to cut the rope that he had found the kid hanged with. [[04:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16213.46s)]
*  The famous Broadway director of the play's hair and Jesus Christ superstar Tom O'Horgan knew both of them. [[04:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16220.46s)]
*  And he remembered the relationship. [[04:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16227.46s)]
*  He said Jack Galen McKinley, the kid's name, was like most of those little boys Harvey found. [[04:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16229.46s)]
*  They were very dependent, looking for some kind of parent and believed it could last forever. [[04:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16235.46s)]
*  There was a pattern Harvey had of finding little waifs. [[04:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16240.46s)]
*  He said that the kid's suicide attempts and emotional disturbances were also part of a pattern in Milk's relationships. [[04:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16244.46s)]
*  He remembered one time that the boy tried to kill himself by jumping off of a wharf. [[04:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16252.46s)]
*  And after he had been fished out of the water, Harvey Milk took him home and tied him up and threw him in a closet wet and muddy and just left him locked in there. [[04:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16256.46s)]
*  After another suicide attempt, Harvey Milk brought the kid to the hospital where his previous lover, Joe Campbell, was still recuperating from his own suicide attempt. [[04:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16265.46s)]
*  The author Daniel Flynn spoke to one gay man who knew Harvey Milk in San Francisco during this time. [[04:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16275.46s)]
*  Quote, Harvey Milk was a total stud, remembers one gay man who left the periphery of Milk's social circle because of what he witnessed. [[04:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16283.46s)]
*  It was his personality. He liked young boys. He liked to abuse young boys. [[04:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16292.46s)]
*  He goes on, Harvey Milk was tenacious, says Bill Stevens, a contemporary and sometimes customer of Milk. [[04:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16298.46s)]
*  He became an animal among young gay men. [[04:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16305.46s)]
*  Running in social circles that overlapped with Milk's, Stevens had opportunities to witness Milk's behavior. [[04:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16308.46s)]
*  Prior to Milk's first run for office, Stevens, Milk and a group of friends descended on the Castro for a night of fun in the bustling gay bars. [[04:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16314.46s)]
*  But Milk's companion, a delicate brunette boy that Stevens pegs at around 17 years of age, was refused service in the watering holes. [[04:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16322.46s)]
*  The group split up. Harvey and his young friend went their way and Stevens and the others went theirs. [[04:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16330.46s)]
*  Early the following morning, Stevens glimpsed the boy balled up in Harvey Milk's doorway. [[04:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16336.46s)]
*  Rough marks vandalized his soft face. [[04:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16341.46s)]
*  I don't remember what I had for breakfast this morning, Stevens explains, but I can tell you exactly what happened that morning. [[04:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16344.46s)]
*  He approached and comforted the teen. [[04:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16352.46s)]
*  He was just crying like a baby, Stevens said. Around the face, maybe around the ear he had some cuts. [[04:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16355.46s)]
*  He was basically real shook up and crying like a baby. [[04:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16361.46s)]
*  In my worst nightmare, I couldn't imagine anyone doing this to a sweet young thing like this. [[04:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16364.46s)]
*  Intending to pick up coffee for himself, Stevens instead treated the boy to breakfast. [[04:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16370.46s)]
*  He was a sweet kid, he remembers, a really sweet little kid. [[04:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16375.46s)]
*  He was a small kid. As I recall, Harvey was 6'1", 6'2". He was older. Harvey was a very strong person. [[04:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16379.46s)]
*  At breakfast, the youth composed himself enough to describe what had transpired. [[04:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16387.46s)]
*  He was pretty upset, Stevens remembers. He said, I got beat up. [[04:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16392.46s)]
*  He said he beat me up and he raped me. [[04:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16398.46s)]
*  I didn't examine him or even say he should go to a doctor. I heard it. It was enough for me. [[04:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16401.46s)]
*  End quote. [[04:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16407.46s)]
*  And the author, Flynn, is careful to point out that Stevens never confronted Milk about this and didn't go to the police. [[04:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16409.46s)]
*  And he says, in fairness, Stevens only got the boy's side of the story and didn't witness the encounter himself. [[04:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16417.46s)]
*  But Stevens' story has remained the same over many tellings and many years. [[04:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16424.46s)]
*  And it's been independently verified that he knew Milk and that people who knew Milk knew Stevens. [[04:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16428.46s)]
*  And they were running in the same circles. And Stevens himself, he has no doubt about what happened. [[04:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16435.46s)]
*  He said it was certainly sexual in nature. [[04:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16441.46s)]
*  Over and above that, you didn't need to be a male gynecologist to recognize that that wasn't the only thing it was about. [[04:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16444.46s)]
*  He was assaulted on his face and his body. [[04:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16449.46s)]
*  In August 1978, a little while later, two months before the Jonestown mass suicide, another one of Harvey Milk's lovers attempted suicide. [[04:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16452.46s)]
*  This time successfully, Harvey Milk came back to the apartment that they shared late from a photo op and found the apartment strewn with empty cans of Coors beer, [[04:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16465.46s)]
*  which was meant as a mockery because Milk had previously announced a boycott of Coors. [[04:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16476.46s)]
*  And notes were scattered around mocking and accusing Milk of various things. [[04:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16481.46s)]
*  This is what I think of your voter registration and you're a lousy lover, Harvey. [[04:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16486.46s)]
*  You've always loved the circus, Harvey. What do you think of my last act? [[04:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16490.46s)]
*  This dude is hanging in the apartment and you come home and you find that. [[04:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16494.46s)]
*  I mean, this is a pretty traumatic and difficult thing. [[04:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16499.46s)]
*  Other notes were hidden in places so that Harvey Milk would find them long after he cut down his lover's body from where it was hanging. [[04:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16504.46s)]
*  Some were even found after Milk had moved out of the apartment. [[04:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16512.46s)]
*  And Harvey Milk called two friends over to help him clean up the scene before the police were called in, burning and flushing the notes that they could find. [[04:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16517.46s)]
*  And within days of the funeral, Harvey Milk was already in a relationship with somebody new. [[04:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16527.46s)]
*  And within a few weeks, he moved that guy into the apartment where his previous boyfriend had just killed himself. [[04:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16532.46s)]
*  And so Harvey Milk had demons. And Jim Jones knew very well how to communicate with demon possessed people. [[04:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16538.46s)]
*  The two became very close. They formed a political alliance when Milk was running to be the first openly gay elected official in San Francisco. [[04:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16546.46s)]
*  And the fact that his orientation was just a non-issue to Jim Jones at a time when that perspective was pretty rare. [[04:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16554.46s)]
*  Their relationship went deeper than politics, though. [[04:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16565.46s)]
*  Some people have speculated that Milk was a follower of Jim Jones, and that probably takes things a little bit too far. [[04:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16568.46s)]
*  But it seems like he was the next best thing. [[04:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16574.46s)]
*  I mean, after attending one of the many temple services that he attended in 1976, Harvey Milk, who was Jewish by background and not a religious guy by any sense, he writes a letter to Jim Jones. [[04:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16578.46s)]
*  I was sorry that I had to leave after four short hours, but I had people waiting and I was so full of warmth that I did not feel bad in leaving before the sun had set. [[04:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16608.46s)]
*  The life of a politician is not one that gives you a chance to stay in a situation that you enjoy, for you must push on to other events. [[04:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16617.46s)]
*  But I found something dear today. [[04:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16624.46s)]
*  I found a sense of being that makes up for all the hours and energy placed in a fight. [[04:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16626.46s)]
*  I found a sense of being that makes up for all the hours and energy placed in a fight. [[04:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16631.46s)]
*  I found what you wanted me to find, and I shall be back, for I can never leave. [[04:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16635.46s)]
*  And later that same year, he wrote Jim again. [[04:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16644.46s)]
*  Our paths have crossed. [[04:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16647.46s)]
*  They will stay crossed. [[04:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16649.46s)]
*  It is a fight that I will walk with you into. [[04:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16651.46s)]
*  Whenever I seem to get a little low, I get a whenever I seem to get a little low, I seem to get a copy of the People's Forum, the temple newspaper. [[04:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16654.46s)]
*  It gives me the strength to wake up and realize that one cannot get tired. [[04:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16662.46s)]
*  There is no time for that. [[04:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16666.46s)]
*  I shall not get tired. [[04:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16667.46s)]
*  The first time I heard you, you made a statement. [[04:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16669.46s)]
*  Take one of us and you must take all of us. [[04:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16672.46s)]
*  Please add my name. [[04:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16675.46s)]
*  And so Jim Jones called 1976 his year of ascension. [[04:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16679.46s)]
*  He was really, I mean, you know, the Los Angeles Times awarded him its mark. [[04:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16686.46s)]
*  Luther King Jr. [[04:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16691.46s)]
*  Humanitarian of the Year Award. [[04:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16692.46s)]
*  I'm sure they'd like to take that one back. [[04:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16695.46s)]
*  The prominent black community leader and very close ally of Jim, Dr. [[04:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16698.46s)]
*  Carlton Goodlett, the two of them started up an import export business together and kicked in to save the third oldest black newspaper in the country, the Norfolk Journal and Guide. [[04:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16702.46s)]
*  The temple purchased hundreds of memberships in the local branch of the NAACP and used them to elect Jim and one of his close followers to its board of directors. [[04:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16714.46s)]
*  Once on an earlier trip out to Washington, D.C., after buses full of temple members were finished viewing the Capitol building, they spread out and began cleaning up trash around the area. [[04:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16725.46s)]
*  And, you know, Jim is savvy. [[04:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16737.46s)]
*  One member posing as a local resident calls up the Washington Post to report, hey, look, report the scene. [[04:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16739.46s)]
*  And so the paper sends a reporter down to record the incident and writes it up in the Washington Post. [[04:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16745.46s)]
*  The hands down winners of anybody's Tourists of the Year Award have got to be the 660 wonderful members of the People's Temple. [[04:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16751.46s)]
*  The spirited group of travelers fanned out from their 13 buses and spent about an hour cleaning up the Capitol grounds. [[04:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16758.46s)]
*  Another time, the U.S. Representative George Brown entered praise for the temple and for Jim Jones personally into the Congressional record after Jim donated several thousand dollars to a few California newspapers in the name of supporting freedom of the press. [[04:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16765.46s)]
*  Tim Carter, one of the former members, remembered that, quote, when Walter Mondale, he was the politician, he would end up running for president against Reagan in 1929. [[04:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16783.46s)]
*  He was the president against Reagan in 1984. [[04:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16794.46s)]
*  When Walter Mondale came to San Francisco to campaign, Jim Jones rode with him in the limo from the airport to the rally downtown. [[04:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16796.46s)]
*  When Rosalynn Carter, wife of President Jimmy Carter, came, they were supposed to have this rally for her and there were not very many people. [[04:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16803.46s)]
*  So they called up the temple and said, can you please get some people down here? [[04:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16810.46s)]
*  We took four buses, two or three hundred people, and packed the place. [[04:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16814.46s)]
*  That rally made national news for the warm and enthusiastic reception she received. [[04:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16818.46s)]
*  That was pretty heady stuff for me, a kid from Burlingame who had ideas of changing the world. [[04:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16823.46s)]
*  Jim was a major draw at political rallies and events across the Bay Area and across California as well. [[04:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16828.46s)]
*  It's one of the things that makes this story so fascinating. [[04:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16836.46s)]
*  When we remember cult disasters like the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, or the mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate cult in the 1990s, [[04:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16840.46s)]
*  virtually nobody had ever heard of those people before they showed up on the news because they'd met their end. [[04:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16849.46s)]
*  People knew who Jim Jones was. He was a big deal. [[04:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16856.46s)]
*  This is a guy who could call mayors of big cities and celebrities and state politicians and get them on the phone and get meetings that day. [[04:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16861.46s)]
*  He was owed favors by very important people. [[04:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16869.46s)]
*  Tim Ryterman writes, [[04:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16873.46s)]
*  Even those politicians disturbed by Jones' personality problems, militarism or militantism, or manipulation, did nothing. [[04:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16904.46s)]
*  First, who would want to risk opposing a church doing such worthwhile work in the community? [[04:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16912.46s)]
*  Second, who would want to offend a machine-like political organization with friends in such high places? [[04:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16917.46s)]
*  Third, how could anyone speak against such a secretive organization with any certainty? [[04:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16923.46s)]
*  Uncertainty, the psychological factor that kept some temple members from defecting, inhibited political figures too. [[04:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16928.46s)]
*  Those with misgivings about the church kept them to themselves. [[04:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16936.46s)]
*  Looking around, they saw only forces of the right speaking against the newfound political power of community groups such as People's Temple. [[04:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16940.46s)]
*  With his constant chatter about the government, rightists, Nazis, fascists, and others being after him, [[04:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16948.46s)]
*  Jones implied that anyone who challenged him would be in bad company. [[04:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16953.46s)]
*  Most bases in San Francisco were covered neatly by 1976, Jones' self-proclaimed year of ascendancy. [[04:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16958.46s)]
*  A favorable rapport was established with virtually all important public figures. [[04:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16966.46s)]
*  Where could opponents, skeptics, or even victims turn if Jones had friends or admirers in the state legislature and the U.S. Congress, [[04:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16971.46s)]
*  the offices of the governor, the mayor, the police chief, the sheriff, the district attorney, [[04:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16979.46s)]
*  as well as on leading black newspapers and the largest daily city newspapers? End quote. [[04:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16984.46s)]
*  This is one of the things that makes this story so fascinating and so different. [[04:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16992.46s)]
*  When we remember cult disasters like the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, or the mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate cult in the 1990s, [[04:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=16997.46s)]
*  virtually nobody had ever heard of those people before they hit the news because they were meeting their end. [[04:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17006.46s)]
*  People knew who Jim Jones was. He was a big deal. [[04:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17012.46s)]
*  This guy could call mayors of major cities, state officials, celebrities, and get meetings that day. [[04:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17017.46s)]
*  He was owed favors by very important people. [[04:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17025.46s)]
*  And so it's hard to overstate the scope of Jim's ambitions in this brief period before everything fell apart. [[04:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17031.46s)]
*  During his amphetamine-fueled fantasies, Jim would see himself, he thought of himself as a leader, a recognized leader of the world revolution. [[04:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17040.46s)]
*  Everybody thinking of, you know, Lenin, Marx, Che Guevara, Jim Jones, [[04:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17050.46s)]
*  thinking of himself being honored with state visits in the Soviet Union and in China. [[04:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17057.46s)]
*  He saw himself as the quiet power behind the governor of California or maybe the president of the United States. [[04:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17062.46s)]
*  You know, methamphetamine is a hell of a drug, but he had some reason to think that this might be possible. [[04:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17070.46s)]
*  But all those fantasies were about to come to an end very abruptly. [[04:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17076.46s)]
*  He managed to cow any hostile press since the San Francisco Examiner tried to do their hit job on him in 1972. [[04:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17081.46s)]
*  But he had made himself an irresistible target by jumping out of the shadows into the cutthroat arena of big city politics. [[04:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17087.46s)]
*  In that arena, you know, they wouldn't even have to be his enemies. [[04:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17098.46s)]
*  People would gladly take his head off just to have some of the blood splash on people who supported him that they didn't like. [[04:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17101.46s)]
*  This is a whole different ballgame. [[04:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17108.46s)]
*  Jim was so used to getting away with everything he tried of gambling and hitting, gambling and hitting, [[04:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17112.46s)]
*  just always finding a way to come out clean from every scrape with danger or controversy that it had warped his sense of what he could get away with, of his own importance to other people. [[04:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17119.46s)]
*  Once you're in this game, the game of politics, it doesn't matter who you are. [[04:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17132.46s)]
*  There's going to be somebody looking to take you out. [[04:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17138.46s)]
*  That's why a little paranoia is appropriate in politics. [[04:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17142.46s)]
*  But if you've already got a pathological penchant for paranoia, you are a disaster waiting to happen because when it inevitably comes, somebody does come after you. [[04:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17147.46s)]
*  You're not going to be able to interpret that and respond like a rational person. [[04:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17157.46s)]
*  A couple of years after this time, I'm talking about shortly after the Jonestown suicide, both Harvey Milk and George Moscon would both be murdered, assassinated in their offices by a city supervisor, a San Francisco city supervisor that the two of them had betrayed a guy named Dan White. [[04:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17164.46s)]
*  And I mean, you know, their betrayal wasn't anything, you know, particularly over the top in context. [[04:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17183.46s)]
*  It was just bare knuckle politics. [[04:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17189.46s)]
*  But Dan White was mentally and emotionally unstable. [[04:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17191.46s)]
*  And he just he was just didn't realize the nature of the game he was in until it was too late. [[04:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17196.46s)]
*  And he had already been slandered and had his name dragged to the mud by two colleagues with whom he thought he had a decent working relationship and and he lost it. [[04:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17204.46s)]
*  The world system. [[04:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17215.46s)]
*  I've been under an awful lot of pressure lately. [[04:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17219.46s)]
*  Financial pressure doesn't matter. [[04:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17222.46s)]
*  Job situations. [[04:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17225.46s)]
*  Family pressure. [[04:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17227.46s)]
*  Because of not being able to have the time of my family. [[04:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17230.46s)]
*  Doesn't it? [[04:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17242.46s)]
*  A lot of the certain people in San Francisco were. [[04:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17247.46s)]
*  I did that. [[04:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17249.46s)]
*  The pressure to wait. [[04:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17251.46s)]
*  And decided to leave. [[04:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17256.46s)]
*  And I've done that. [[04:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17259.46s)]
*  My family and friends offered their support and said whatever would take to allow me to go back in the office. [[04:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17262.46s)]
*  And they would be able to take that over. [[04:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17272.46s)]
*  I felt responsibility. [[04:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17277.46s)]
*  The people were elected me. [[04:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17280.46s)]
*  I went to the mayor of the school and told him that I had a situation. [[04:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17283.46s)]
*  A change because of the support of family and friends. [[04:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17288.46s)]
*  But he became my seat. [[04:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17292.46s)]
*  He appointed to my seat. [[04:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17294.46s)]
*  Initially told me that. [[04:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17298.46s)]
*  He felt that I was elected representative of district 8. [[04:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17300.46s)]
*  That I was doing an outstanding job. [[04:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17304.46s)]
*  Keeping district 8 up in the air. [[04:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17306.46s)]
*  And that if it came to a legal room that he would appoint me. [[04:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17310.46s)]
*  He would appoint me. [[04:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17314.46s)]
*  Because of the type of person I was. [[04:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17316.46s)]
*  So with that in mind I tried to set my personal affairs in order. [[04:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17319.46s)]
*  I tried to take my seat. [[04:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17326.46s)]
*  Then it came out. [[04:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17330.46s)]
*  That supervisor belt. [[04:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17333.46s)]
*  Some others were working against me to get my seat back on the board. [[04:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17336.46s)]
*  I learned of this. [[04:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17342.46s)]
*  I was in the city attorney's office. [[04:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17344.46s)]
*  Supervisor belt called. [[04:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17346.46s)]
*  Stating that he was in that mind. [[04:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17349.46s)]
*  He didn't speak to me. [[04:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17351.46s)]
*  He spoke to the city attorney. [[04:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17352.46s)]
*  I was in the office and I heard the conversation. [[04:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17355.46s)]
*  He was going to kind of prevent me from taking my seat again. [[04:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17359.46s)]
*  I looked back at the mayor. [[04:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17364.46s)]
*  And he told me. [[04:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17366.46s)]
*  That he had had some comments made to him. [[04:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17369.46s)]
*  That he felt that some of the people in district 8 didn't want me to serve. [[04:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17373.46s)]
*  I was in the district attorney's office. [[04:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17380.46s)]
*  I was in the district attorney's office. [[04:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17383.46s)]
*  I was in the district attorney's office. [[04:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17386.46s)]
*  I was in the district attorney's office. [[04:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17388.46s)]
*  I was in the district attorney's office. [[04:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17390.46s)]
*  I was in the district attorney's office. [[04:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17392.46s)]
*  I was in the district attorney's office. [[04:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17394.46s)]
*  I was in the district attorney's office. [[04:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17396.46s)]
*  I was in the district attorney's office. [[04:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17398.46s)]
*  I was in the district attorney's office. [[04:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17400.46s)]
*  I was in the district attorney's office. [[04:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17402.46s)]
*  I was in the district attorney's office. [[04:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17404.46s)]
*  And I lived there, knowing they were going to charge me. [[04:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17406.46s)]
*  I lived there, knowing they were going to charge me. [[04:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17408.46s)]
*  The one thing I want the judges to do in order to make darkness running down my house. [[04:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17410.46s)]
*  The only thing they'd do is to find a place [[04:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17413.46s)]
*  that they could come and earn money from and grab them. [[04:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17416.46s)]
*  And they'd laugh me and tell me how it's like being there. [[04:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17420.46s)]
*  Because all the judges, all the handymen are going to come and start me. [[04:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17427.46s)]
*  Two months later, the district attorney's in there once again, but no one hears about it. [[04:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17433.46s)]
*  They charge their goals, but my family suffers. [[04:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17439.46s)]
*  Did I suffer for it? Phone calls we get. [[04:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17443.46s)]
*  I could see the game that was being played, that we were going to use me as a scapegoat. [[04:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17447.46s)]
*  And where I was a good supervisor, it was my belief that this was a critical opportunity. [[04:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17454.46s)]
*  They were going to denigrate me, my family, and the job that I tried to do, and well, that's getting me out to dry. [[04:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17462.46s)]
*  And I saw more and more evidence of this through the week when papers reported that someone else was going to be reappointed. [[04:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17473.46s)]
*  I couldn't get through the letter. The boy never called me. [[04:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17485.46s)]
*  He told me he was going to call me before he made any decision. He never did that. [[04:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17489.46s)]
*  It was only my own initiative when I went down today to speak with him. [[04:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17494.46s)]
*  I was troubled. [[04:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17500.46s)]
*  The pressure of my family, my self-doubt, my babysitter, my wife's got to work. [[04:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17504.46s)]
*  Four hours, 50 and 60 hours. Never seen my family. [[04:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17512.46s)]
*  Can you tell Inspector, reminds myself, what was your plan this morning? What did you have in mind? [[04:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17519.46s)]
*  I didn't have any device plan or anything. [[04:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17526.46s)]
*  I went to the house to talk to see the mayor, and I went downstairs to make a phone call. [[04:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17532.46s)]
*  And I had my gun down there. [[04:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17541.46s)]
*  Did you put a service for Robin? [[04:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17544.46s)]
*  I said, God, I had one on the place. [[04:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17546.46s)]
*  And it was in my home. [[04:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17549.46s)]
*  And I don't know. I just put it on. I don't know why I put it on. It's just... [[04:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17552.46s)]
*  And then I went to the mayor's office. [[04:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17561.46s)]
*  You know, I just was going to the bar to see if he was going to appoint me. [[04:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17564.46s)]
*  And that's the reason why. [[04:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17569.46s)]
*  Because I wanted to see him. [[04:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17571.46s)]
*  And he told me he wasn't going to be appointing me. [[04:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17575.46s)]
*  And he wasn't going to intend to tell me about it. [[04:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17578.46s)]
*  He told me he had a press conference scheduled. [[04:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17582.46s)]
*  He was going to announce a press conference. [[04:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17585.46s)]
*  He didn't have even the courage to call me or tell me that I wasn't going to be appointed. [[04:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17587.46s)]
*  And then my control was fuzzy. [[04:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17593.46s)]
*  And just my head didn't feel right. [[04:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17599.46s)]
*  Nothing was getting through to me. It was just like a morning in my ears. [[04:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17604.46s)]
*  And then he just came to me, you know, and he couldn't hear what he was saying. [[04:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17610.46s)]
*  It was small talk. [[04:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17615.46s)]
*  You know, it just wasn't registered. What am I going to do now? [[04:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17618.46s)]
*  How this is going to affect my family? [[04:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17622.46s)]
*  It's just all the time going. He's going to go out and lie for press. [[04:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17626.46s)]
*  Tell them that I wasn't a good suit liner and that people didn't want me. [[04:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17632.46s)]
*  And then that was it. I just shut up. [[04:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17639.46s)]
*  Politics was no place for a guy like that. [[04:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17644.46s)]
*  And it was no place for a guy like Jim Jones. [[04:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17648.46s)]
*  His entire operation, his whole life, depended on maintaining secrecy [[04:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17652.46s)]
*  and making sure that the only face anybody ever saw was the one that he spent time in the mirror practicing. [[04:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17657.46s)]
*  On some level, he knew this. [[04:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17665.46s)]
*  You know, Reiterman writes that he was careful with reporters once he became the head of the housing authority. [[04:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17667.46s)]
*  But again, years and years of meth abuse and cult worship will make you lose your perspective and understanding of how you look to other people. [[04:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17672.46s)]
*  You would think that as an ambitious guy with a lot to hide, [[04:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17684.46s)]
*  he should have known better than to turn his housing authority meetings into these big public spectacles. [[04:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17687.46s)]
*  You're rolling into routine bureaucratic affairs with an armed entourage and packing the house with his cheering fans. [[04:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17694.46s)]
*  But again, Jim kind of had good reason to believe that he could get away with anything. [[04:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17701.46s)]
*  The San Francisco Chronicle reporter named Julie Smith remembers being assigned to check out Jim Jones around this time. [[04:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17709.46s)]
*  Quote, I was sitting at my desk at the Chronicle and the assignment editor says, Miss Smith, [[04:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17718.46s)]
*  we have a new housing commissioner and it looks as if he can heal the sick and possibly even raise the dead. [[04:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17724.46s)]
*  Would you be interested? And I went, wow, that's just my kind of thing. [[04:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17729.46s)]
*  How very San Francisco. [[04:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17732.46s)]
*  I didn't know how I was going to write this, but I knew that I wanted to write about faith healing on the part of a city official. [[04:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17735.46s)]
*  And so unbeknownst to Miss Smith, the temple had contacts at the Chronicle and she soon found herself being spied on and followed around by temple staff. [[04:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17742.46s)]
*  So she continues. [[04:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17751.46s)]
*  So I make a phone call and say, can I interview you? [[04:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17753.46s)]
*  Jones says, I want to get back to you. [[04:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17756.46s)]
*  And the next day, floods of letters begin pouring into the newsroom before I ever even got another phone call. [[04:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17759.46s)]
*  And I said to Steve Gavin, the city editor, something's funny. [[04:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17765.46s)]
*  And Steve said, well, let's just see what you can get. [[04:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17769.46s)]
*  Call around and see. [[04:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17772.46s)]
*  So I called Bob Mendelsohn, supervisor Robert Mendelsohn. [[04:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17773.46s)]
*  I said, what's the deal, Bob? [[04:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17777.46s)]
*  Every time I make a move, 10 people call the Chronicle and say how great Jones is. [[04:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17778.46s)]
*  What's this all about? [[04:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17782.46s)]
*  What's his significance to city politics? [[04:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17783.46s)]
*  And Bob says, listen, Julie, Jones can mobilize 5000 people out on the streets for any cause, any candidate. [[04:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17786.46s)]
*  If you're a politician, this is a powerful thing. [[04:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17794.46s)]
*  And if he's against something, he can do something about that, too. [[04:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17796.46s)]
*  Everybody loves Jim Jones. [[04:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17798.46s)]
*  This is a guy who gets things done. [[04:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17800.46s)]
*  Five minutes later, after I hung up, you know, no time at all lapses. [[04:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17802.46s)]
*  Bob Mendelsohn calls me back and says, you know, Julie, maybe you shouldn't quote me on that. [[04:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17806.46s)]
*  So I asked him, well, why not? [[04:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17810.46s)]
*  He says, I don't know. [[04:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17813.46s)]
*  It may not be a good thing. [[04:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17815.46s)]
*  And that kind of thing happened a lot. [[04:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17817.46s)]
*  It was like everybody you called somehow in 10 minutes. [[04:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17819.46s)]
*  You were getting a call from the church about it. [[04:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17821.46s)]
*  And so what finally happened was, well, I was in the I was heavy into indoor plants at the time at home. [[04:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17823.46s)]
*  I had an awful lot of plants and I'd be in mud up to my elbows and the phone would ring and it would be Jones. [[04:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17832.46s)]
*  His timing was impeccable because they were spying on me. [[04:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17838.46s)]
*  And he would say, Julie, I'm so worried. [[04:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17841.46s)]
*  I'm afraid you're going to say something terrible about us. [[04:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17844.46s)]
*  And it's so important to our people. [[04:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17846.46s)]
*  We do so much for them. [[04:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17848.46s)]
*  And there could be a backlash for them. [[04:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17849.46s)]
*  Smith says at the time she didn't know what he was talking about because she hadn't gotten any dirt on him or the organization. [[04:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17852.46s)]
*  So she thought his paranoia was just strange. [[04:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17859.46s)]
*  She goes on. [[04:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17862.46s)]
*  I finally got to go to the church. [[04:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17864.46s)]
*  But before the service, they were showing me around and I was taken to a tiny little room with no windows in it. [[04:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17866.46s)]
*  And it was just full of hanging plants. [[04:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17872.46s)]
*  Well, why would you have a little room like that filled with plants with no windows? [[04:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17876.46s)]
*  It didn't make any sense. [[04:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17880.46s)]
*  There was nothing in the room but a massage table. [[04:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17882.46s)]
*  All of a sudden, all the other people that were there melted away. [[04:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17885.46s)]
*  And I was in the tiny room with Jones by myself. [[04:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17889.46s)]
*  And he says to me, you know, my wife has back trouble and I can't really have sex with her. [[04:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17892.46s)]
*  What is going on here? [[04:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17899.46s)]
*  I don't know if he was so insane that he was trying to imagine that I would suddenly say, whoa, Jim, baby, come to me right now or what. [[04:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17901.46s)]
*  But I got out of there. [[04:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17908.46s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[04:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17909.46s)]
*  There was a minor faith healing service that day and I wrote the story and Gavin would turn it back to me and say, well, can't we make this a little more objective? [[04:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17912.46s)]
*  And I would say, what do you mean a little more objective? [[04:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17920.46s)]
*  Well, he sent it back to me six or seven times. [[04:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17923.46s)]
*  And Jones was calling me every five minutes saying, well, I've heard that you had to do another rewrite. [[04:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17926.46s)]
*  I heard that you wrote a hatchet job. [[04:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17931.46s)]
*  And so she finishes the story finally gets it past her direct editor. [[04:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17935.46s)]
*  And she felt it was entirely too soft with all the meat cut out of it. [[04:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17939.46s)]
*  But she took some solace in the fact that she had at least been able to explore a bit about the question of Jim's significance in city politics and had at least gotten in a few lines describing the faith healing. [[04:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17943.46s)]
*  And so the article goes to press that night and she wakes up the next morning and opens the paper and sees that even those two parts have been removed from her story after she'd sent it up past her editor. [[04:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17956.46s)]
*  And she was never able to figure out which of the higher ups had scrubbed the article or how it was that Jim Jones had enough juice with the editors of the San Francisco Chronicle. [[04:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17967.46s)]
*  And this is a big paper to make something like that happen. [[04:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17977.46s)]
*  And finally, she says about the whole thing, kind of summarizing it, she says, quote, we underestimated Jones. [[04:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17981.46s)]
*  He didn't really think like an adult. I mean, he called the mayor at 2 a.m. [[04:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17988.46s)]
*  Where was everybody's judgment? [[04:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17993.46s)]
*  I think a lot of people just thought he was a well-intentioned bozo. [[04:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17996.46s)]
*  But for the record, I never, for an instant, thought he was well-intentioned. [[04:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=17999.46s)]
*  Bozo, yes. But from the first moment, he scared the hell out of me. [[05:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18002.46s)]
*  And then she remembers something that she hadn't mentioned before to the interviewer. [[05:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18007.46s)]
*  When Jones finally agreed to meet me, he had been sitting on a throne surrounded by about 10 of his followers. [[05:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18013.46s)]
*  And when he stood, the rest of them all stood in unison as if at a prearranged signal. [[05:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18020.46s)]
*  And I swear to God, the hair on the back of my neck prickled, something that usually only happens when I see a spider. [[05:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18026.46s)]
*  And that's the point at which I thought something really wrong is going on here. [[05:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18032.46s)]
*  It was just an amazing, scary thing to see. [[05:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18037.46s)]
*  And she put that in the story, but that part was cut out as well. [[05:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18042.46s)]
*  And so Jim kind of had good reason to think he could just keep dodging these bullets forever. [[05:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18046.46s)]
*  He was paranoid as hell. You know, he believed that the most powerful forces in the world were after him. [[05:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18052.46s)]
*  But he thought that he was smart enough and lucky enough and maybe blessed enough to keep things on track. [[05:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18058.46s)]
*  But that all started to change on July 4th, 1976, the bicentennial, when Greystone fled People's Temple. [[05:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18066.46s)]
*  I haven't really done a decent enough job keeping you up on this, so I should provide a little refresher very quickly on where things stand with Jim and his personal life at this time. [[05:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18078.46s)]
*  His family's grown since the last time I mentioned it. [[05:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18088.46s)]
*  He's still married to Marceline, but their relationship is, I don't know, something like a king and queen married for political reasons. [[05:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18091.46s)]
*  You know, they sit next to one another on the throne and when there's a ceremony or anything, they do it together and she wears the crown. [[05:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18099.46s)]
*  But if the king has needs that he wants fulfilled, he has mistresses for that. [[05:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18106.46s)]
*  He and Marceline have their one natural born son, Stephen, who's now about 16 or 17 years old, and they have an adopted black son, Jim Jones Jr., who's about the same age. [[05:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18113.46s)]
*  They have two other adopted kids, the Korean war orphans that they adopted in the late 50s and another adopted daughter, a white girl named Agnes, who was a troubled girl and kind of out of the picture, mostly kept off to the side. [[05:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18124.46s)]
*  And then there was another black boy named Johnny, who they now called their son but never officially adopted. [[05:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18138.46s)]
*  Jim's primary mistress was still Carolyn, formerly Carolyn Layton, and the two of them also had a son, a boy named Kimo. [[05:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18144.46s)]
*  For outward appearances, Carolyn got married to a church member named Mike Prokes, and officially the boy's name was Kimo Prokes, but everybody understood the situation, that it was Jim's son. [[05:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18153.46s)]
*  In the mid 1970s, Jim took on another serious mistress that would be with him to the end, a young girl named Maria Katsaris, as well as Carolyn's sister Annie, although she had a slightly different role. [[05:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18164.46s)]
*  Outside of those three, he slept with dozens and dozens of others, you know, whenever it struck his fancy, but didn't develop anything that persisted with them. [[05:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18176.46s)]
*  And finally, there was Grace Stone, whose story we told in an earlier episode. She had come into the temple with her boyfriend, then husband Tim Stone when she was 18 years old. [[05:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18186.46s)]
*  She didn't like it at first. She didn't like Jim at first, but she found some purpose in the temple, and eventually Jim grew on her enough that the two apparently became sex partners as well. [[05:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18198.46s)]
*  When she got pregnant in the early 1970s, everybody believed that the baby boy was Jim Jones's son and Grace's husband, Tim, who had been estranged from her for some time by this point, signed an affidavit testifying that he had asked Jim Jones to sleep with and impregnate his wife, and that the boy, officially John Victor Stone, was the son of Jim Jones. [[05:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18208.46s)]
*  Grace herself has always been reluctant to discuss the issue, but there's no doubt that whatever the truth of the matter, Jim Jones for sure believed that the boy was his son and treated him like his son. [[05:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18231.46s)]
*  And so Jim lost his mind when Grace left. One temple member who remained loyal to the movement even after the mass death. [[05:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18242.46s)]
*  She later said, I will never forget the night Grace Stone left the church as long as I live. Jim looked like the life and breath had been stolen from him. [[05:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18252.46s)]
*  Grace was the woman that Jim had chosen to administer and be in charge of the San Francisco temple headquarters, and she knew everything. [[05:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18262.46s)]
*  And she was as deep inside the church as anyone, and she was the mother of his child, and she had fled without warning. I mean, it caught him completely off guard. [[05:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18272.46s)]
*  But she had fled without the boy, who had spent the last several years being raised collectively by the church. [[05:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18283.46s)]
*  An emergency meeting of the Planning Commission was called, and Jim ranted and raved like a madman, writer men describes him behaving like a wounded animal. [[05:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18293.46s)]
*  The people are all nodding along in sympathy with their leader and in hatred for Grace Stone. [[05:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18302.46s)]
*  But she was only 18 years old when she'd left, rather joined the church six years prior, and so her whole adult life really had been spent in there. [[05:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18310.46s)]
*  And she was still too wrapped up to just make a clean break. So a few days after leaving, she called Jim from Nevada, wanting to explain to him why she had left and get some kind of closure and understanding. [[05:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18319.46s)]
*  And Jim starts using that as an opportunity to manipulate her, plays the aggrieve party. He acts hurt. [[05:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18332.46s)]
*  And since he still controls Grace's husband, Tim, who was loyal to Jim Jones like a dog, he also controlled Grace's access to her son, and he used that as well. [[05:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18341.46s)]
*  He used it to extract some concessions from her. He got her to record a message, for example, claiming that she was only gone on a mission that he had assigned her, just to give him time to think of how to handle this. [[05:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18352.46s)]
*  But Jim's closest advisors knew the truth, and eventually everybody would. [[05:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18366.46s)]
*  She was allowed, after a while, to speak to her son on the phone, but she couldn't get more than one word answers from him, and soon realized that he was being watched over and coached about what to say. [[05:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18373.46s)]
*  After a while, she was allowed a few supervised short visits with him, and when she saw him, she realized that he was being turned against her. [[05:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18386.46s)]
*  When she showed up for her first visit, the other children who were there all started crying and screaming, and her husband, Tim, was hostile to her for leaving, and one day, without her knowledge, but with her husband Tim's permission, Grace's son, John Victor, was put on a plane and sent down to join the small but growing number of settlers in the Guyana jungle at Jonestown. [[05:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18395.46s)]
*  Since coming to an agreement with the government of Guyana, the church had assigned a few dozen hardworking young men to go down there and clear the jungle and get ready to start building a settlement, and they'd be living down there, and they were making some progress, although just clearing the jungle is a very long process. [[05:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18419.46s)]
*  And at this point, Jonestown is a little more than a camp, but as it became a place where a few people could live, occasionally the church would send others down to help, especially young men, teenagers, who they wanted to get out of California for one reason or another. [[05:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18437.46s)]
*  You know, if a teenager was getting into trouble, they would send him down to Jonestown to work with the men. [[05:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18454.46s)]
*  But now they sent John Victor, who's four years old at this time. [[05:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18459.46s)]
*  Tim Ryterman wrote that, [[05:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18464.46s)]
*  In an early November 1976 phone conversation with Tim, Grace learned that her son was in the promised land. [[05:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18466.46s)]
*  He had been spirited off in October. [[05:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18473.46s)]
*  Grace was numb with shock, stricken. [[05:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18475.46s)]
*  Her voice became nearly inaudible. [[05:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18478.46s)]
*  It made her sick, she said. [[05:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18480.46s)]
*  She thought that she would die. [[05:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18482.46s)]
*  But Grace was a fighter. [[05:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18485.46s)]
*  You got to give her that. [[05:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18486.46s)]
*  She was not going to go quietly into the night, as so many other people had. [[05:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18487.46s)]
*  She was determined to have her son back. [[05:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18492.46s)]
*  And the fight that she would take to Jim Jones, if you had to point to one thing, was probably the single proximate cause that brought People's Temple to its destruction. [[05:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18494.46s)]
*  And Jim, for his part, was consumed by Grace's departure. [[05:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18505.46s)]
*  He had people tracing her phone calls to her general location in Carson City and then going up there and driving around the city looking for calling dozens of businesses to see if she'd taken a job doing clerical work somewhere. [[05:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18509.46s)]
*  I don't know what he would have done if he'd have found her. [[05:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18522.46s)]
*  I mean, they may have kidnapped. [[05:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18524.46s)]
*  I have no idea. [[05:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18526.46s)]
*  He tried everything to get her back. [[05:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18527.46s)]
*  But at the same time, he's still he's still Jim Jones. [[05:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18530.46s)]
*  He's got other duties to the church and with the San Francisco Housing Authority. [[05:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18534.46s)]
*  And as he's doing these things, these other duties, the emotional wear and tear and the stress is showing on him. [[05:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18538.46s)]
*  After one Housing Authority meeting, Jim approached a San Francisco Chronicle reporter who was typically assigned to the to the Housing Authority meetings, and he confronted the reporter and told him that he had heard that he didn't like Jim Jones. [[05:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18545.46s)]
*  He thought he was eccentric and he was trying to butter the guy up, but it was just making him suspicious. [[05:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18558.46s)]
*  And this reporter, Marshall Kilduff, had been watching Jim for a while. [[05:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18563.46s)]
*  I mean, how do you know you're assigned to this boring? [[05:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18567.46s)]
*  Housing Authority beat for the San Francisco Chronicle and all of a sudden this guy takes over. [[05:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18571.46s)]
*  I mean, he'd been watching him and he was interested. [[05:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18576.46s)]
*  And so plus he remembered the temple shutting down the San Francisco examiner's 1972 story and he didn't like that. [[05:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18580.46s)]
*  And he knew Julie Smith personally, so he knew that story and how the temple had been able to control her reporting at his own paper. [[05:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18587.46s)]
*  And he didn't like that. [[05:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18595.46s)]
*  So Kilduff tells Jim that, you know, he doesn't know how Jim would know that he didn't like him or where he would have heard that. [[05:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18596.46s)]
*  But in any case, if he did believe that he wouldn't say those things publicly. [[05:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18603.46s)]
*  And they kind of keep talking and Jim tells him, I feel like you don't trust me and kind of trying to intimidate him a little bit. [[05:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18607.46s)]
*  But that's the opposite of what happened. [[05:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18613.46s)]
*  Rather than intimidating killed of Jim's attempt to do so, really just convinced him for sure that I'm going to do a story about Jim Jones. [[05:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18616.46s)]
*  I'm going to do a story on this guy. [[05:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18625.46s)]
*  On a Sunday morning in January of 1977, Kilduff is given a tour of the San Francisco temple with about 10 other people. [[05:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18629.46s)]
*  And he soon realizes that all of the other people are temple plants and all of them are asking leading questions just to give the tour guide an opportunity to praise the temple and talk about all their good work. [[05:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18638.46s)]
*  He was the only actual person on the tour. [[05:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18651.46s)]
*  Everybody else was there for his benefit. [[05:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18653.46s)]
*  And this was on a Sunday morning before a service was scheduled. [[05:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18655.46s)]
*  And they were the service was being held up. [[05:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18659.46s)]
*  He realized there were some 2000 people waiting in the auditorium for this to finish. [[05:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18662.46s)]
*  And he was brought out very ostentatiously in front of a bunch of people who knew that they had been kept waiting for this one guy. [[05:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18667.46s)]
*  And as he's brought out, they point out to him that his own boss, the San Francisco Chronicle City Editor, was seated among the congregation. [[05:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18675.46s)]
*  So these people knew how to put on a show. [[05:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18686.46s)]
*  When he asked the city editor the next day about doing a story on the temple, the guy gave him resistance. [[05:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18689.46s)]
*  But by this point, Marshall Kilduff was not going to back down. [[05:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18695.46s)]
*  He was too curious about this preacher who seemed to hold half of San Francisco in thrall. [[05:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18698.46s)]
*  And so he was resolved. [[05:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18703.46s)]
*  He said later he was ready to do a story for a freelance magazine to publish it himself, whatever he had to do if his own paper wouldn't run it. [[05:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18704.46s)]
*  And so he begins to investigate and he finds many people with strong negative opinions about the temple, but he can't get anybody to go on record. [[05:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18713.46s)]
*  At housing authority meetings, the temple knows by this point that he's looking into them. [[05:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18722.46s)]
*  And so temple spies are following him everywhere, placed around him at the meetings, making no pretension of what they're doing. [[05:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18727.46s)]
*  They're looking right over his shoulder and leaning over, staring at his notes and then copying them down openly. [[05:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18734.46s)]
*  It became a running joke among the other reporters. [[05:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18740.46s)]
*  They were going through his garbage at home. [[05:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18744.46s)]
*  They were following him around after hours. [[05:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18747.46s)]
*  The next issue of the People's Forum, the temple newsletter, warned of an approaching attempt to smear the temple in the media and subsequent issues began to prepare the information space to defend the temple from whatever Kilduff was planning. [[05:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18750.46s)]
*  Meanwhile, things were about to get much worse for Jim Jones, immeasurably worse. [[05:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18765.46s)]
*  More members of the church were realizing that Greystone had fled for good and other people were beginning to follow her out the door. [[05:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18772.46s)]
*  There were rumors that some of the defectors, many of whom still had family members in the temple, were communicating with each other now and that there were discussions of forming an organized group, a group with legal status, to lobby the government to take action against Jim in the temple. [[05:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18781.46s)]
*  Jim and the others on temple staff began to suspect the loyalty of Grace's husband. [[05:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18800.46s)]
*  They were estranged, but still, Tim Stone had grown sullen since Grace had fled and Grace had become more aggressive in the budding fight over the custody of her son and Jim believed that Tim Stone might be a weak link in that fight. [[05:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18805.46s)]
*  And so he told Tim that since the courts are likely to favor the mother in a custody case, even one is unfit and horrible and blah blah blah as Grace, Tim, the legal father of the child, might be faced with a court order to return the boy and so the best way to head that off was to take Tim out of the picture altogether for a while. [[05:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18821.46s)]
*  And so Tim was ordered to take a leave of absence from the district attorney's office and move to Guyana until otherwise directed, where he would oversee operations at the Jonestown camp and be a liaison to the Guyanese government. [[05:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18840.46s)]
*  So Tim follows instructions, but the temple was right to suspect his loyalty. Before he left, Tim Stone had obtained a new passport and he had asked his father to set up new private bank accounts for him out of state. [[05:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18853.46s)]
*  Jim's spies intercepted a letter from Stone's father shortly after he left for Guyana talking about all this. [[05:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18868.46s)]
*  And so down in Guyana, others were ordered to watch over Tim Stone, make sure he doesn't go anywhere. [[05:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18874.46s)]
*  And Jim gets most of his close aides and flies down to Guyana to meet him face to face. [[05:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18880.46s)]
*  And they stay down there for a few weeks. While they're there, Jim starts suffering from heart attacks nearly every night, you know, quote unquote heart attacks. [[05:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18886.46s)]
*  And his aides are pleading with Tim Stone. Look at all the stress you're causing him. [[05:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18896.46s)]
*  You know, after everything he's done for you, look what you're doing to him. And they're they're begging him, please recommit yourself to the cause. [[05:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18900.46s)]
*  Do you don't kill Jim Jones? [[05:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18905.46s)]
*  Tim tells Jim that he's tired of the temple's rules. He's tired of the asceticism. [[05:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18909.46s)]
*  He misses women and good music. And so Jim offers to buy the Holiday Inn on the island of Grenada and let Tim run that place as a socialist convention center. [[05:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18913.46s)]
*  Whatever you want, just stay, stick around, don't go anywhere. [[05:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18922.46s)]
*  And so Tim agrees. He bows out of pressure, I mean, out of weakness, really, rather than sincerity. [[05:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18925.46s)]
*  But regardless of any doubts that Jim may have had about him, he had to be handled with kid gloves. [[05:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18931.46s)]
*  I mean, he just knew too much more than anyone, more than Jim even about the temple's operations. [[05:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18939.46s)]
*  And moreover, he's just irreplaceable as an administrator. The temple, I mean, you just they couldn't live without him. [[05:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18947.46s)]
*  One day, with all of his chief lieutenants in one place, Jim orders his staff to a meeting at the temple's new headquarters in the Guyanese capital. [[05:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18955.46s)]
*  It's a house that they had that they had rented to be their headquarters there. [[05:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18966.46s)]
*  And Tim Reiterman writes, quote, In recent weeks, Jones said he had decided to move the church yet again. [[05:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18971.46s)]
*  The pressure in the United States was too much for him, or rather the prospect of what might be revealed was one day about this time he paced the house, [[05:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18978.46s)]
*  obsessed with the Kildof article, certain that it would be negative and destructive. [[05:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18987.46s)]
*  Suddenly, he stopped his railing and turned to one of his Jones down, Jones town construction foreman. [[05:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18991.46s)]
*  What do you think about moving a lot of people down here quickly? It's impossible, replied the foreman. [[05:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=18997.46s)]
*  We don't have the wood for housing pacing again. Obviously irritated. Jones persisted. [[05:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19002.46s)]
*  How many people could we accommodate now? About 150 to 200 people at the maximum. [[05:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19008.46s)]
*  He explained that the Jonestown crews had been hampered by the financial bureaucracy in the rainy season. [[05:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19015.46s)]
*  Although to date only one permanent structure had been built, a dormitory, Jones pressed ahead with his plans to bring a thousand Americans to the jungle. [[05:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19020.46s)]
*  From April 27 through May 1, 1977, Jones and his top aides met for 16 to 20 hours a day in the master bedroom of the George County headquarters. [[05:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19028.46s)]
*  The other church leaders echoed the worries of their leader. [[05:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19038.46s)]
*  They had agonized over the problem so much that they were becoming self-fulfilling prophecies. [[05:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19042.46s)]
*  The only handwriting on the wall in May 1977 was their own. [[05:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19047.46s)]
*  Marshall Kilduff had yet to locate a single damaging informant and had not even found a publication to print his story. [[05:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19052.46s)]
*  That did not matter to Jones. He was a prophet. He had foreseen it all. [[05:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19058.46s)]
*  Of course, no one suspected that the apparent machinations of the church's enemies were really plotted or at least invited by Jim Jones himself. [[05:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19063.46s)]
*  In fact, the exodus to Guyana would follow in almost every detail an organizational blueprint drawn up four years earlier prior even to acquisition of the Caribbean sanctuary. [[05:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19072.46s)]
*  Jones's contagious paranoia, not enemies, was driving them out of the United States. [[05:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19082.46s)]
*  The threats could have been survived, but through tactical blunders and overkill, temple leadership would aggravate their existing problems and create new ones. [[05:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19088.46s)]
*  Though they fretted about government investigations, government agencies in reality were uninterested in them. [[05:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19097.46s)]
*  The FBI, still smarting over disclosures of its anti-leftist campaigns in the 1960s, was not involved and would not be until it was too late. [[05:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19103.46s)]
*  The Federal Communications Commission was monitoring temple amateur radio transmissions, but only for minor infractions of amateur radio rules that could have easily been stopped. [[05:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19112.46s)]
*  The IRS was only questioning whether the temple's political activity exceeded its standards for tax-exempt organizations and only after the church wrote them repeatedly asking whether it was under investigation. [[05:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19122.46s)]
*  Fear of the unknown played upon Jones's fixations. He returned to San Francisco in a morose mood. The future looked grim. [[05:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19133.46s)]
*  Of course, no one on the outside knew of the plans for an exodus, but by coincidence, the temple was asked a short time later to participate in a Golden Gate bridge demonstration opposing suicide. [[05:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19143.46s)]
*  The organizers called the rally to dramatize their objective, the installation of suicide barriers along the span to prevent people from climbing the low railing and jumping off. [[05:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19154.46s)]
*  On Memorial Day 1977, Jones and some 600 followers showed up at the Golden Gate, each wearing an armband bearing the name of one of the bridge's victims. [[05:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19165.46s)]
*  With local news media and wire services looking on, Jones delivered a generalized appeal of concern for suicide victims. [[05:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19174.46s)]
*  Then, abruptly, his tenor changed. Suddenly he was the one being driven to the brink. [[05:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19183.46s)]
*  Suicide is a symptom of an uncaring society, he said. The suicide is the victim of conditions which we cannot tolerate and—and— [[05:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19190.46s)]
*  He paused, realizing that he had misspoken. [[05:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19199.46s)]
*  I guess that was Freudian, because I meant to say which he cannot tolerate, which overwhelm him, for which there is no recourse. [[05:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19203.46s)]
*  Jones then became even more direct. [[05:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19211.46s)]
*  I've been in a suicidal mood myself today for perhaps the first time in my life, so I have personal empathy for what we're doing here today. [[05:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19215.46s)]
*  And then he ended with an abrupt, thank you, end quote. [[05:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19223.46s)]
*  Very shortly after this, Tim Stone made his escape from People's Temple. [[05:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19229.46s)]
*  And shortly after that, Marshall Kilduff's story ran in a San Francisco magazine. [[05:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19235.46s)]
*  The story itself was watered down and weak. [[05:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19241.46s)]
*  There was nothing in it that could have really plausibly threatened Jim Jones or the Temple, but again, the Temple was its own worst enemy. [[05:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19244.46s)]
*  As soon as it ran, they called in debts everywhere they could, and Rupert Murdoch, the owner of the magazine, begins receiving calls from prominent politicians and prominent citizens demanding that this article be taken down. [[05:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19252.46s)]
*  Advertisers come under pressure to boycott the publication over it. [[05:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19265.46s)]
*  The editorial offices are getting 50 phone calls, 70 letters a day complaining about it. [[05:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19269.46s)]
*  And this article, which would have faded away almost certainly if they had just let it ride, now word's starting to get around about the Temple's pressure campaign, and others are starting to pay attention. [[05:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19275.46s)]
*  The San Francisco Examiner becomes interested in this story. [[05:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19290.46s)]
*  Kilduff and another writer are assigned to look deeper into it. [[05:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19293.46s)]
*  And with the increased profile about the pressure campaign, more and more people know about it, and now those two writers start to get phone calls themselves, but this time from Temple defectors who want to talk to them. [[05:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19298.46s)]
*  Among the people they talked to were Al and Jeannie Mills, the couple who had left after their daughter was publicly beaten. [[05:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19314.46s)]
*  And they also got calls from some of the eight revolutionaries who left in 73, and finally they got a phone call from Greystone. [[05:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19320.46s)]
*  On July 17th, 1977, that magazine reported that there was a break-in at its offices, and that actually turned out to be a misunderstanding. [[05:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19327.46s)]
*  There was no break-in, but them reporting it and Jim seeing that and knowing that they hadn't done it, it convinced him that they're planning to slander him and that they will do anything possible to destroy it. [[05:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19339.46s)]
*  And once he knew that the former members were working with them people he considered traitors and enemies, the walls just started to close in on his mind. [[05:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19350.46s)]
*  The night before the next story by Kilduff and his co-writer was scheduled to go to press, they called Jim Jones to discuss it and to read it to him to see any final input that he might have before it went to press. [[05:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19359.46s)]
*  Jim's staff was gathered in his office as he was read the final product in full over the telephone and they saw his face blank but draining of blood. [[05:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19376.46s)]
*  As he realized that there was nothing he could do to stop this article from being published, he covered the mouthpiece of the phone with his hand and mouthed to his staff, [[05:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19387.46s)]
*  Get ready, we are leaving. [[05:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19399.46s)]
*  Now if it seems like things escalated quickly here, it's not just my storytelling, they did. [[05:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19404.46s)]
*  It's like Hemingway said about bankruptcy happening slowly at first and then all at once. [[05:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19411.46s)]
*  You know bankruptcy when you're not talking about one individual who loses his job but a company or organization. [[05:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19416.46s)]
*  Often when it finally comes people look back through the numbers and wonder how did nobody see this coming? [[05:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19423.46s)]
*  It was so obvious. [[05:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19428.46s)]
*  How are things today so different from the way things were yesterday that now the whole house of cards suddenly collapses? [[05:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19430.46s)]
*  There wasn't any big event that brought it about but in the temple everything depended on nobody taking a closer look at what was going on. [[05:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19438.46s)]
*  And once Jim made the move into the political world it was just a matter of time. [[05:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19448.46s)]
*  I guess I should catch you up on what's been happening at Jonestown. [[05:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19454.46s)]
*  I haven't said much about it because up until this point not a whole lot has been happening. [[05:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19459.46s)]
*  That's a big part of why things went to hell so quickly after Jim Jones moved down there with everybody. [[05:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19464.46s)]
*  From the time work had begun on the settlement in late 1974, early 75, the population of the place had been limited to a few dozen young pioneers, [[05:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19473.46s)]
*  guys who were cut out for the hard work of carving a future life out of this jungle. [[05:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19482.46s)]
*  It was hard work. [[05:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19487.46s)]
*  They were putting in 18 hour days creating the outlines of this little village but it was nice. [[05:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19490.46s)]
*  It was hard work but it was nice. [[05:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19497.46s)]
*  It was a happy place. [[05:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19499.46s)]
*  Instead of rooster crows, monkey calls woke them up in the morning and they talk about songbirds changing the mood as the sun went down. [[05:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19500.46s)]
*  They were deep in the jungle, again obviously just way out there, and they felt that isolation but they liked it. [[05:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19508.46s)]
*  They were getting to know the Amerindians who lived along the river and in the jungle around the place. [[05:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19518.46s)]
*  Sometimes they would bring them into the settlement, show them movies, and the Indians would make this alcoholic beverage they called jungle juice and they would share that with them. [[05:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19524.46s)]
*  Building this place was very hard work in a very difficult environment but there was a great sense of camaraderie among the pioneers. [[05:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19533.46s)]
*  And best of all, they got to work without supervision, without the planning commission and the staff micromanaging everything that they were doing. [[05:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19541.46s)]
*  After years of being in the temple and having that being the case, that was everyone's favorite part. [[05:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19551.46s)]
*  After a day's work they would hang out and sing songs, watch movies again. [[05:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19556.46s)]
*  It would have been forbidden by the temple back home. [[05:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19562.46s)]
*  There was at least one small child there, John Victor, but they liked that too. [[05:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19567.46s)]
*  He'd become kind of a little mascot to the pioneers. [[05:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19572.46s)]
*  Every so often there would be a few new arrivals, again mostly teenage boys who were having trouble back in California and were sent down there to get off the streets and work with the men. [[05:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19576.46s)]
*  But that was fine too. That experience almost always had a positive effect and they got worked into the group very, very easily. [[05:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19585.46s)]
*  The whole mood changed very quickly around May 1977 when Jim was breaking down under the stress of the defections of Tim and Grace. [[05:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19595.46s)]
*  And the prospect of negative media attention was coming down the pipe. [[05:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19604.46s)]
*  Suddenly new settlers began arriving by the dozen, unannounced. [[05:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19609.46s)]
*  The Jonestown construction crew would be ready to meet a boat on the Kaituma River to pick up supplies. [[05:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19615.46s)]
*  Supplies could only be brought in by boat or plane. [[05:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19622.46s)]
*  And surprise, there would be 10 or 12 new people who'd been sent to Jonestown. [[05:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19625.46s)]
*  The builders hadn't been told or expecting it, so they hadn't been focusing on building more cottages for people to live in. [[05:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19629.46s)]
*  They'd been putting their energy into infrastructure in common areas, so immediately housing the people became a problem. [[05:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19636.46s)]
*  Now those projects, the infrastructure, had to be put on hold so that the builders could scramble to put up enough housing to hold the new arrivals. [[05:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19643.46s)]
*  But every time they were about to catch up, another boat would come in with another batch of settlers. [[05:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19651.46s)]
*  And worse, the new settlers weren't restricted to healthy men and teenage boys who could help with the work. [[05:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19656.46s)]
*  Many of them were very old people who not only couldn't handle the work, but were having trouble handling the environment. [[05:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19662.46s)]
*  And again, this is right on the equator in a rainforest in the summer. [[05:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19668.46s)]
*  Many of them were very young children who not only couldn't work, but required constant supervision. [[05:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19673.46s)]
*  And so it was becoming much more stressful very quickly. [[05:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19680.46s)]
*  But the people did their best, you know, because the people who were coming were coming because they wanted to be there. [[05:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19684.46s)]
*  They kept their spirits up and they had a good attitude. They did their best to pitch in. [[05:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19690.46s)]
*  And so while things were somewhat more stressful, Jonestown still was a pretty happy place. [[05:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19694.46s)]
*  And then Jim and his staff arrived. And once that happened, Jonestown had seen its last happy day. [[05:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19703.46s)]
*  The pioneers had expected to have a couple years to build up Jonestown. [[05:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19710.46s)]
*  And we're not talking about setting up a town on the central coast to California. [[05:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19715.46s)]
*  This is a rainforest, a real, legit triple canopy rainforest with zero existing infrastructure, no nothing. [[05:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19719.46s)]
*  I mean, just to create room to build anything, the men were using slash and burn just to just to create space. [[05:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19728.46s)]
*  It was expected to take several growing seasons, several planting seasons just to test various crops in this jungle soil. [[05:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19736.46s)]
*  These people aren't farmers. Just to test various crops to figure out what worked and what didn't and what was worth putting more energy into and in what ratios. [[05:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19743.46s)]
*  And they were in the very early stages of that. [[05:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19752.46s)]
*  The Guyanese government itself had expected that preliminary process to take at least five years. [[05:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19756.46s)]
*  Everyone did their best, but they were not prepared for this influx. [[05:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19761.46s)]
*  Children were often sent first because that helped ensure that their parents would not back out, that they would follow. [[05:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19767.46s)]
*  If there were couples who were going to be sent, they would usually not be sent on the same trip. [[05:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19777.46s)]
*  Often they'd be sent months apart. [[05:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19781.46s)]
*  Often the women would be sent first for the same reason. [[05:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19783.46s)]
*  Often the women would be sent first for the same reason. [[05:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19786.46s)]
*  It would make sure that the other part of the couple didn't back out. [[05:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19789.46s)]
*  And they were told that this was a tactic to avoid attracting attention from enemies. [[05:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19794.46s)]
*  You know, the temple buses would be filled up with people and sent around the country, dropping them off at different airports so that they wouldn't tip anybody off with some mass exodus from California to Guiana as if anybody was watching. [[05:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19798.46s)]
*  If anybody thought that this was strange, they went along with it. [[05:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19813.46s)]
*  But, you know, that's the thing. [[05:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19816.46s)]
*  Most people no longer found it strange. [[05:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19818.46s)]
*  Most people believe Jim and the staff, basically, when they said that the government was after them. [[05:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19821.46s)]
*  You know, I mean, that's easy enough to understand. [[05:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19826.46s)]
*  Why wouldn't they believe that they had seen? [[05:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19828.46s)]
*  These are people who had seen assassinations. [[05:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19830.46s)]
*  They had seen organizations that they that they believed in and approved of like the Panthers infiltrated and taken down. [[05:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19833.46s)]
*  And by now, everybody knew about Cointel Pro and the Pentagon Papers. [[05:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19840.46s)]
*  And so why wouldn't the government be dead set on taking down one of the last remaining serious civil rights organizations? [[05:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19845.46s)]
*  Plus, people were excited to go. [[05:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19853.46s)]
*  You know, they heard they were going to paradise. [[05:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19855.46s)]
*  They're free for a while. [[05:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19857.46s)]
*  They've been shown these videos when Jim would go down there. [[05:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19858.46s)]
*  You know, they would do things like go to the markets in Georgetown and buy a whole bunch of fresh produce and then bring it to Jonestown and put it out all over the world. [[05:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19861.46s)]
*  And tell people that look at what we've grown in Jonestown. [[05:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19869.46s)]
*  Meanwhile, almost nothing had been planted. [[05:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19872.46s)]
*  People thought they were going to paradise. [[05:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19875.46s)]
*  The people who had gone before them were sending back letters telling everybody how wonderful it was. [[05:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19878.46s)]
*  And so you had old ladies who had never been on an airplane putting on their best clothes for the first and last airplane ride they would ever take to go down to Guyana. [[05:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19884.46s)]
*  And it was a hell of a trip. [[05:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19895.46s)]
*  Like I said, Guyana is a small country, very, very small country. [[05:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19897.46s)]
*  But once you flew over there, it took another 24 hours to get to the settlement after the plane landed in Georgetown. [[05:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19900.46s)]
*  After the flight, you boarded a boat, took a bumpy ride along the coast of the Kaituma River and then up the river to a docking place near Jonestown. [[05:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19907.46s)]
*  And it was a real transition. [[05:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19916.46s)]
*  You know, you're talking about people who've never been out of the United States taking this trip. [[05:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19918.46s)]
*  And as they're on the trip up this river, these these people who had never been anywhere like this are staring out into this dense jungle and they see, you know, naked Amerindians peeking out from the trees back at them. [[05:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19922.46s)]
*  They see here animals that, you know, sounds that they've never heard. [[05:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19936.46s)]
*  When you when you this trip over there really kind of gave them a sense of the isolation, you know, that they would be living in. [[05:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19942.46s)]
*  When they arrived at the port on the river, a tractor waited for them at the dock and they loaded into a trailer and it hauled them through the jungle toward the settlement where the Jonestown Children's Choir was waiting to welcome them with a song they all knew. [[05:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19949.46s)]
*  And it was great. Everybody described this moment as great. [[05:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19980.46s)]
*  Family and friends were there if they'd already shown up and they rushed forward with smiles and hugs and welcome or so great to see you. [[05:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19985.46s)]
*  Other people took their luggage off to their assigned living quarters for them. [[05:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19993.46s)]
*  After a 24 hour long empty hot boat ride, the people are exhausted, but they went along when the greeters insisted on an immediate tour of Jonestown. [[05:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=19998.46s)]
*  And when they finally got back to their bunk rooms to change clothes and get some rest, they found that their luggage had been searched and their passports had been taken. [[05:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20007.46s)]
*  If they asked why, they were told that the passports were being stored in a central location to keep them dry for safekeeping. [[05:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20016.46s)]
*  And that sounded reasonable enough. [[05:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20024.46s)]
*  And anyway, most of the people who went to Jonestown, as far as they were concerned, they plan to stay there. [[05:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20026.46s)]
*  This was their new life. [[05:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20033.46s)]
*  This was their new life. And so what difference did it make? [[05:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20034.46s)]
*  And they trusted their leaders. [[05:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20036.46s)]
*  When Jim arrived, he asked again, how many people can we plausibly accommodate here if we absolutely had to immediately? [[05:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20040.46s)]
*  And his people gave him the same answer. [[05:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20049.46s)]
*  One hundred and fifty, two hundred people max. [[05:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20050.46s)]
*  And they met one hundred and fifty to two hundred people who could work. [[05:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20053.46s)]
*  But within just a couple months of Jim's flight from California, there would be about a thousand settlers in Jonestown, at least two thirds of them elderly people or children. [[05:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20056.46s)]
*  Now, Jim had no experience with farming or any of the skills or knowledge necessary to make something like Jonestown work. [[05:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20069.46s)]
*  But he was sure that it was nothing that couldn't be overcome with discipline and hard work. [[05:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20077.46s)]
*  And so when he and his staff arrived, they took control of everything. [[05:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20081.46s)]
*  All freedom in Jonestown evaporated that day. [[05:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20085.46s)]
*  Again, the pioneers have been used to working hard, but freely. [[05:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20090.46s)]
*  And now Jim and his inner circle were micromanaging not only every aspect of the work, but of daily life. [[05:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20094.46s)]
*  They believe the temple was under attack in the United States and the settlers had only a limited time to prepare Jonestown to serve the people. [[05:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20103.46s)]
*  They believed Jonestown to be a defensible safe haven before the siege inevitably came to the jungle. [[05:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20111.46s)]
*  From Jeff Gwynne, quote, No task was assigned, no crop planted, no tool purchased without Jones's approval. [[05:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20116.46s)]
*  Those wanting to begin romantic relationships had to apply for permission first. [[05:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20125.46s)]
*  And even if they received it, had to endure a probationary period before officially becoming a couple. [[05:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20130.46s)]
*  Breakups had to be approved as well. [[05:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20135.46s)]
*  All of the incoming mail was opened and read before being passed on to the intended recipient. [[05:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20137.46s)]
*  Outgoing mail was censored. [[05:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20143.46s)]
*  Jones insisted that letters from Jonestown contain only glowing descriptions of bucolic life. [[05:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20145.46s)]
*  Unacceptable letters were returned to their writers with scribbled margin notes instructing them about what changes must be made. [[05:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20150.46s)]
*  Jones's inner circle did the censoring, with Carolyn Leighton and Maria Katsaris forming a two-woman buffer between even these subordinates in Jones. [[05:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20157.46s)]
*  Carolyn and Maria were Jones's only real intimates, carrying out his orders and guessing what he would want done on those occasions when he was indisposed. [[05:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20165.46s)]
*  There were plenty of drugs ordered in Jonestown by camp physician Larry Schacht, and a fair amount of those found their way into Jones's possession as well. [[05:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20174.46s)]
*  For everyone else in Jonestown, privacy was virtually non-existent. [[05:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20183.46s)]
*  Cottages were overcrowded with as many as eight, then ten, then a dozen or more occupants as newcomers kept coming in. [[05:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20187.46s)]
*  Even with sixteen holes each, the outhouses were constantly crowded. [[05:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20193.46s)]
*  Real toilet paper was a rare extravagance. [[05:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20197.46s)]
*  Scrap paper was most often used, and then leaves after paper became so scarce in Jonestown that every bit was needed for record-keeping letters. [[05:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20200.46s)]
*  There was limited water available in primitive showers. [[05:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20208.46s)]
*  Workers, filthy from a day in the fields, had only two minutes to rinse off, and they were warned to keep their mouths closed while washing since the water was polluted. [[05:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20212.46s)]
*  Jones had much nicer quarters and facilities. [[05:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20220.46s)]
*  He lived with Carolyn, Maria, John Victor, and Kimo in a private cabin, with soft beds, a private latrine, and a generator that powered a refrigerator filled with drugs and soft drinks, as well as a floor fan. [[05:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20223.46s)]
*  Jones's quarters were connected to a camp radio room. [[05:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20235.46s)]
*  He didn't have to leave to make calls or broadcast to the United States, and, if he chose, could even make camp announcements from the comfort of his home. [[05:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20239.46s)]
*  One black man named Eugene Smith was one of the people who arrived to Jonestown months after his wife was already there. [[05:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20246.46s)]
*  Eugene Smith had joined as a teenager with his mother, but he had become a man in the temple, and now he was married. [[05:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20253.46s)]
*  And in the year before the mass exodus, Eugene Smith was becoming alarmed by the increasing craziness, the escalating brutality of the temple's physical punishment. [[05:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20259.46s)]
*  He remembers that people had always gotten punished for things, he says, but the discipline was beginning to go to what I considered overboard. [[05:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20271.46s)]
*  Before, it might have been little physical punches or whatnot, but now people were being bloodied up, and it was escalating. [[05:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20280.46s)]
*  I'm not scared, but I'm getting really, really cautious. [[05:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20288.46s)]
*  My wife, Ollie, is a woman of a family of four, and she's a woman of four. [[05:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20292.46s)]
*  I'm not scared, but I'm getting really, really cautious. [[05:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20296.46s)]
*  My wife, Ollie, is roughly three months pregnant, and I'm thinking, okay, what am I going to do if they come after her? [[05:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20300.46s)]
*  All of a sudden, they say, okay, Ollie, time for you to go to Jonestown. [[05:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20307.46s)]
*  And I'm saying, hold it, no, no, no, no, no. [[05:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20312.46s)]
*  One of the counselors tells me, well, Eugene, you have to be strong. [[05:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20315.46s)]
*  You don't want your child born over here in a capitalistic society, do you, where they won't get a fair shake? [[05:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20319.46s)]
*  And I'm thinking, well, no, I don't, but I don't want Ollie over there in the jungle without me. [[05:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20324.46s)]
*  But see, they knew how to control me. If you have Ollie, you're controlling me. [[05:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20331.46s)]
*  I don't care if it's fire right there. If Ollie's on the other side, I'll go through fire. [[05:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20336.46s)]
*  That's just the way it was. I was her protector. [[05:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20340.46s)]
*  Ollie was sent down there first. She was in Jonestown, and I was back in the States. [[05:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20343.46s)]
*  I'm talking to Ollie, you know, via shortwave radio, and I want to see her so bad. [[05:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20348.46s)]
*  I had to wait until the powers that be said that it was time for me to go. [[05:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20352.46s)]
*  Eventually it was time, and I was in one of the groups that drove the buses all the way across country and left from Florida to go to Guyana. [[05:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20356.46s)]
*  And I brought this duffel bag full of cassettes. [[05:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20364.46s)]
*  I knew I wasn't coming back to the States, so I taped classical, jazz, rhythm and blues, pop, any kind of music I could think of. [[05:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20367.46s)]
*  I recorded everything, so I had hundreds of tapes. [[05:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20374.46s)]
*  Now the day I arrived in Jonestown, it was raining. It was monsoon season, and it was just raining its ass off. [[05:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20376.46s)]
*  Ollie was nine months pregnant, about to have our baby. I can't wait to get there. [[05:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20384.46s)]
*  We come to the main gate. We're going down the main road, and I could hear the people a good mile away. I could hear them singing, right? [[05:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20389.46s)]
*  And I'm getting amped. I was like, oh man, this is going to be so cool. [[05:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20397.46s)]
*  As we come around the curve, I can see the pavilion 30 or 40 yards off. [[05:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20401.46s)]
*  First thing that happens, they take the duffel bag with all my music and say, we're confiscating this. [[05:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20404.46s)]
*  You might get them back after we see what's on them. [[05:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20410.46s)]
*  Before I could respond, I see Ollie, and I run up to her, and I'm saying, oh, you're so big. You're so beautiful, you know? [[05:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20413.46s)]
*  And I'm looking around, trying to take everything in. I see my mother. She's lost a lot of weight, but she looks really good. [[05:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20419.46s)]
*  And Jones is up there in his seat, and I'm listening, and the music gets lower and lower, and the music gets lower and lower. [[05:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20426.46s)]
*  And the beat slows down. It's almost quiet. And the next thing I hear, we actually know exactly what he heard. [[05:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20434.46s)]
*  For perhaps one of the most important announcements you have ever heard. [[05:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20444.46s)]
*  I'm giving you the free night that I just authorized spoken over this medium. [[05:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20451.46s)]
*  I urge, however, that you do not wander in any way out of the central area of the community and keep a strict curfew after the entertainment. [[05:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20459.46s)]
*  We have no question now that our ex-members are being funded and our CIA connected. [[05:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20476.46s)]
*  But if you were to make the mistake to assume that you could go up to one of these people, they might kill you. [[05:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20488.46s)]
*  Do not think that they would interpret you as a friend, no matter what you said. [[05:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20500.46s)]
*  They are highly paranoid, extremely vicious, filled with a raging hate, because that's what comes from guilt. [[05:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20506.46s)]
*  But do not make the mistake. There may be even hired mercenaries coming in also. [[05:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20519.46s)]
*  So amongst those that you might think are former members that might take you in, any move would be sub-staffed if you moved towards them. [[05:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20528.46s)]
*  Eugene Smith remembers the feeling. My heart dropped. What is this? I'm holding on to Ollie really tight, and Jones says, [[05:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20542.46s)]
*  The enemy's out there. They're out there, just outside your eyesight. They want to take our children. They want to torture our children. [[05:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20551.46s)]
*  They want to take our seniors. They're there to take us down. They're doing it because we slapped America in the face, and we said we're going to create another America the way it should be. [[05:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20558.46s)]
*  You're 200 miles into the dark jungle. My mind is spinning going, I'm so glad I'm here with Ollie, but at the same time it's like, we've got to get out of here. [[05:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20567.46s)]
*  Now, Jonestown wouldn't have been a proper communist utopia without one major thing, unless its leaders blamed everything that went wrong on enemy infiltrators. [[05:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20576.46s)]
*  Famines and production failures under Mao and Stalin were always attributed to bourgeois infiltrators and saboteurs who wanted to see the experiment fail at a greater spite. It's a universal characteristic. [[05:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20586.46s)]
*  In the name of the people, the records have to be rooted out. But who are the records? Who are the saboteurs? The records are among the people. [[05:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20596.46s)]
*  It's a recipe for permanently accelerating paranoia when you have a system that is faulty at its inception, because its inborn flaws mean that there will always be failures, [[05:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20606.46s)]
*  and the people in charge can only interpret those failures as the result of attacks by enemies or infiltrators. [[05:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20616.46s)]
*  As the failures cascade and pile up and the system comes closer and closer to total failure, the enemies start to be responsible for all this. They grow into monsters of gigantic proportion. [[05:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20622.46s)]
*  Jonestown was going to fail the moment it was going to happen. [[05:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20633.46s)]
*  The moment Jim Jones moved a thousand people onto a piece of land that would only have sustainably supported a few hundred at most. [[05:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20639.46s)]
*  And again, assuming an experienced and healthy workforce with time to lay the groundwork for that kind of community to survive. [[05:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20647.46s)]
*  Not maybe 250 or so working people trying to support another seven or eight hundred. [[05:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20655.46s)]
*  For example, Jim had hoped Jonestown could bring in income by selling excess crops at market in Jonestown or on contract to the Guyanese government, [[05:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20660.46s)]
*  but the place was nowhere close to even being able to provide enough food for its own settlers themselves, and never would be. [[05:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20668.46s)]
*  Rather than having excess crops to raise the price of food, the place was a place of self-sufficiency. [[05:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20676.46s)]
*  Other than the sweep blow, the temple was spending money to import food just to keep people handled. [[05:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20683.46s)]
*  The [[05:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20696.46s)]
*  A month, that's monthly expenses. [[05:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20704.48s)]
*  The temple was collecting social security checks from the elderly people there, but [[05:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20707.6s)]
*  that only offset about $40,000 a month. [[05:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20711.56s)]
*  With the bad press back home and Jim Jones away indefinitely, attendance at the San Francisco [[05:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20715.76s)]
*  temple had collapsed to no more than 300. [[05:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20722.14s)]
*  Jim's wife Marceline was there conducting the services and trying to hold things together, [[05:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20725.52s)]
*  but weekly donations had all but dried up. [[05:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20729.239999999998s)]
*  The Los Angeles temple collapsed entirely and the building was soon put up for sale, [[05:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20733.32s)]
*  as was the property up in Redwood Valley in the north. [[05:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20738.2s)]
*  The temple still had some income from the state for its nursing homes and rehab centers, [[05:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20742.2s)]
*  but this was drying up as well, and in any case came nowhere close to closing the gap. [[05:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20746.92s)]
*  Soon, the settlers were required to surrender all of their jewelry and all their extra clothing [[05:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20752.96s)]
*  and any other valuables or saleable items that they had brought with them. [[05:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20758.36s)]
*  The records don't give us much about anybody resisting this. [[05:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20762.96s)]
*  You know, they all wanted to prove that they were good socialists and there was a lot of [[05:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20765.84s)]
*  peer pressure. [[05:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20770.12s)]
*  In any way, what good were those things in the jungle? [[05:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20771.12s)]
*  And now when new people showed up, it wasn't just their passports that were confiscated. [[05:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20774.44s)]
*  Now, surrendering any valuables they brought with them, that was part of the check-in process. [[05:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20778.44s)]
*  And all of it was taken into Georgetown and sold in stalls or consignment shops. [[05:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20785.48s)]
*  When some people failed to give up everything that they had brought with them and were discovered [[05:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20790.88s)]
*  they'd be called up in front of the group and grilled as potential bourgeois infiltrators, [[05:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20795.22s)]
*  it is amazing how rapidly this transformation happens in societies like this. [[05:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20801.04s)]
*  Just regardless of scale, whether you're talking about the Soviet Union or Jonestown, in no [[05:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20806.64s)]
*  time flat, from each according to their ability, donate to help the community to an old lady [[05:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20810.98s)]
*  up to Jonestown, having her luggage search and being patted down to make sure she wasn't [[05:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20817.239999999998s)]
*  concealing an old wedding ring that was the only thing she had to connect her to her dead [[05:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20822.0s)]
*  husband. [[05:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20825.88s)]
*  Some people were assigned to go door to door in Georgetown to beg for money, but before [[05:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20829.32s)]
*  long they had covered all the middle class neighborhoods with little to show for it. [[05:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20833.6s)]
*  The kids and the old folks were put to work manufacturing toys like cars and trains carved [[05:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20838.8s)]
*  out of wood and these little dolls and these were taken to Georgetown to be sold to tourists [[05:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20843.8s)]
*  and that raised a little bit of money but as you can imagine not much. [[05:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20848.8s)]
*  Jonestown residents owned nothing more than the clothes on their backs and maybe one or [[05:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20854.64s)]
*  two changes but clothes deteriorated very quickly in the jungle, especially on people [[05:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20859.84s)]
*  doing hard labor and so new clothes, especially socks and underwear became another unexpected [[05:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20865.28s)]
*  monthly expense. [[05:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20870.079999999998s)]
*  But food was always the biggest problem. [[05:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20873.28s)]
*  From the time they got there to the time it all ended, from Jeff Gwynne, quote, feeding [[05:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20877.0s)]
*  a few dozen pioneers was relatively inexpensive. [[05:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20881.68s)]
*  Providing over 900 settlers with three nourishing meals a day was prohibitive. [[05:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20885.34s)]
*  Everyone wanted meat. [[05:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20891.239999999998s)]
*  Jones calculated that serving chicken or pork at a single Jonestown dinner cost $2,000. [[05:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20892.66s)]
*  The old communal fallbacks of peanut butter sandwiches and oatmeal that worked back in [[05:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20898.28s)]
*  the States weren't sufficient in the jungle where so many adults and teens performed hard [[05:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20902.08s)]
*  physical labor all day long. [[05:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20906.280000000002s)]
*  They needed lots of calories, protein in particular. [[05:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20908.920000000002s)]
*  Faced with crushing food costs, rice, which also had to be purchased rather than grown [[05:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20912.84s)]
*  but was at least inexpensive, became the primary Jonestown staple. [[05:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20917.2s)]
*  Soaked in watery gravy, dotted sparingly with specks of meat, it was included in most meals. [[05:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20921.920000000002s)]
*  Cassava flour, raised in the fields and ground in Jonestown's own mill, was prepared in various [[05:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20927.84s)]
*  ways. [[05:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20933.12s)]
*  There were chicken coops and a pigory, but it was hard to keep the chickens alive long [[05:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20934.719999999998s)]
*  enough to produce eggs. [[05:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20937.88s)]
*  Beverages were limited too, usually water or a sweet powdered drink called flavor aid, [[05:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20940.239999999998s)]
*  which was cheaper than the better known Kool-Aid. [[05:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20944.92s)]
*  Desserts were virtually unknown during weekday meals. [[05:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20948.96s)]
*  Once each weekend, though, Jones made a point of rewarding each follower with a single cookie, [[05:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20952.2s)]
*  dramatically handed out by him as settlers filed past. [[05:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20957.04s)]
*  Everyone was always hungry and everyone was always tired. [[05:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20963.4s)]
*  There was a PA system installed throughout the camp and everyone was awakened at 6 a.m. [[05:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20969.64s)]
*  every morning. [[05:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20974.96s)]
*  They were quickly pushed through a breakfast line and then sent off to work by 6.30 a.m. [[05:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20975.96s)]
*  Most people worked out in the fields or did other hard physical labor. [[05:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20981.760000000002s)]
*  Most of them were in the fields. [[05:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20986.16s)]
*  Most of them were given a sack lunch so that they wouldn't have to waste work time returning [[05:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20988.2s)]
*  for the noon meal. [[05:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20991.96s)]
*  They worked out in the sun for 12 hours until they got the call over the PA at 6 or 6.30 [[05:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=20994.0s)]
*  in the evening. [[05:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21000.48s)]
*  Then from there it was straight to a communal dinner in the central pavilion of rice and [[05:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21001.96s)]
*  gravy followed by a people's rally or a group meeting also in the pavilion. [[05:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21006.4s)]
*  During these meetings, Jim would sit up on stage on a throne under a sign slightly misquoting [[05:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21013.22s)]
*  Santayana, those who forget history are condemned to repeat it. [[05:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21019.02s)]
*  Jim and his close staff, who were always hopped up on amphetamine injections, they keep these [[05:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21024.100000000002s)]
*  meetings going for hours and hours and hours into the night. [[05:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21029.460000000003s)]
*  Lights out was supposed to be at 11 p.m. but as weeks turned into months, the meetings [[05:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21033.74s)]
*  almost always ran past that, although sometimes the kids and the old folks would be allowed [[05:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21037.54s)]
*  to go to bed. [[05:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21041.82s)]
*  They would just go on and on. [[05:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21043.18s)]
*  They resembled the planning commission meetings and struggle sessions often back in California, [[05:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21045.78s)]
*  only now they involved hundreds more people who had never seen this side of the temple [[05:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21049.98s)]
*  before. [[05:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21054.9s)]
*  After the mass meeting was over, the group would break up into various committees for [[05:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21057.58s)]
*  more meetings and this would go on until 1, 2, 3 in the morning every night. [[05:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21060.98s)]
*  Then people were up with the loudspeaker at 6 a.m. the next morning to do it all over [[05:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21067.3s)]
*  again. [[05:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21071.5s)]
*  Sometimes during the day the loudspeaker would play music as the people worked, but often [[05:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21077.58s)]
*  it was taken over by Jim for rants and political lectures and other announcements. [[05:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21082.1s)]
*  He would make recordings of himself to play over the PA when he had other things to do, [[05:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21087.98s)]
*  recordings of him reading communist literature or reading and commenting on newspapers or [[05:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21092.94s)]
*  magazine articles, ranting against their enemies. [[05:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21098.02s)]
*  It got to the point where you would wake up exhausted after three or four hours of sleep [[05:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21100.46s)]
*  and eat breakfast hearing his voice. [[05:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21108.06s)]
*  You'd walk out to your job hearing his voice. [[05:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21113.9s)]
*  You'd work all day hearing his voice. [[05:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21118.22s)]
*  He was there when you took your bathroom breaks. [[05:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21123.940000000002s)]
*  He was there when you ate your lunch and walked like a zombie back to the pavilion for dinner [[05:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21126.5s)]
*  and then finally the PA system would be turned off so that you could hear him rant for six [[05:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21131.62s)]
*  more hours into the night at the meeting. [[05:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21136.22s)]
*  Back in California Jim was for most people a distant kind of mysterious figure. [[05:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21140.82s)]
*  Most people saw him up in the pulpit, you know, to music and admiration, making a grand [[05:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21148.7s)]
*  entrance, performing miracles and being fed by politicians and famous radicals. [[05:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21152.940000000002s)]
*  In Jonestown he was everywhere, all the time and in a much more candid state. [[05:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21158.140000000003s)]
*  That happens, the mystique begins to drop off pretty quickly. [[05:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21167.260000000002s)]
*  Jim's son, Jim Jones Jr., who was 18 or 19 by this time, he was engaged to marry his [[05:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21171.86s)]
*  girlfriend, Yvette. [[05:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21178.86s)]
*  Around this time Jim declared that Jim Jr. was going to go to Georgetown to be his liaison [[05:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21180.82s)]
*  to the Guyanese government. [[05:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21185.14s)]
*  Jim was cool with that because he was going to get out of the jungle at least, but then [[05:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21186.86s)]
*  he wasn't so cool with it when he found out his fiance wasn't going to come with him. [[05:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21191.7s)]
*  He says, that began turning me against my dad. [[05:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21195.62s)]
*  Then what really got me was once after I went to Georgetown I had to come back with somebody [[05:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21200.02s)]
*  from the Guyanese government who wanted to do an inspection and also talk to Jim. [[05:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21205.62s)]
*  We get there and no Jim. [[05:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21211.02s)]
*  I go to his cottage and he's lying there passed out from drugs. [[05:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21213.579999999998s)]
*  So here I am dragging my father into the shower and standing in there with him trying to get [[05:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21218.379999999997s)]
*  him in shape to go out and talk to this guest. [[05:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21223.379999999997s)]
*  This is from Jeff Gwynne, quote, in California Jones was able to indulge himself without [[05:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21226.1s)]
*  the knowledge of most followers. [[05:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21233.379999999997s)]
*  In Jonestown it was impossible. [[05:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21235.66s)]
*  Jones had more privacy than anyone else, but the confines of the camp made it impossible [[05:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21238.42s)]
*  for settlers not to observe at least some of his carryings on. [[05:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21242.44s)]
*  The man who led them to believe he was a powerful god, dripped with sweat, swelled from gluttony. [[05:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21247.16s)]
*  Temple staff in San Francisco had to send new, larger shirts for Jones to disguise his [[05:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21253.019999999997s)]
*  bloated belly and whined constantly about aches and pains. [[05:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21257.059999999998s)]
*  Now the great healer apparently couldn't even heal himself or anyone else. [[05:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21261.78s)]
*  One elderly follower was diagnosed with inoperable cancer soon after arriving in Guyana. [[05:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21266.02s)]
*  For decades Jones had showily removed tumors from the apparently afflicted. [[05:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21271.14s)]
*  In Jonestown the cancer-stricken woman was simply made as comfortable as possible while [[05:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21275.699999999997s)]
*  she awaited death. [[05:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21279.899999999998s)]
*  Though still most believed in Jones as a leader and as their spokesman against the racism, [[05:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21282.18s)]
*  capitalism and elitism that they all deplored, there was no longer for most any element of [[05:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21287.06s)]
*  worship. [[05:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21292.34s)]
*  In Jonestown after a while, Jim Jones lost his divinity, Laura Johnston Cole says. [[05:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21293.620000000003s)]
*  Everyone saw too much. [[05:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21299.74s)]
*  Often they heard too much. [[05:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21302.22s)]
*  Jones' cabin was connected by phone to the camp radio and loudspeaker system. [[05:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21304.620000000003s)]
*  When lying on his bed not completely blacked out in a drug stupor, he would harangue the [[05:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21309.22s)]
*  settlement and workers in the fields with incoherent barks and mumbling. [[05:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21313.38s)]
*  One day, overwhelmed by hours of gibberish, radio operators in the communications shack [[05:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21317.74s)]
*  switched off Jones' phone and everyone bashed in the blessed silence. [[05:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21322.86s)]
*  Hello? [[05:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21327.86s)]
*  Attention. [[05:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21328.86s)]
*  Attention. [[05:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21329.86s)]
*  Excuse the fact, please, that I've been up several nights and days fighting this horrible [[05:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21330.86s)]
*  conspiracy with our wonderful attorney, Charles Gary. [[05:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21342.74s)]
*  It's staggering to the imagination. [[05:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21349.66s)]
*  Also we're having some P.A. problems, but they'll be able to refine those out so you [[05:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21353.86s)]
*  can hear the news in the library. [[05:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21361.460000000003s)]
*  I'm very sorry also that I have a larynginic voice that makes for unpleasant listening. [[05:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21365.18s)]
*  Anyway, the socialist revolution in all countries and under all countries, revolution in the [[05:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21374.94s)]
*  countries and under the countries of all the countries and under the countries and [[05:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21389.38s)]
*  under the very struggles and number of circumstances has the same political purpose, has the same [[05:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21405.02s)]
*  political purpose, no matter what method they use. [[05:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21423.5s)]
*  Anyway, back in the United States, Tim and Greystone had found their way to the group [[05:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21432.14s)]
*  of former members who were organizing against the temple. [[05:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21439.82s)]
*  And once they got there, they got two things. [[05:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21444.22s)]
*  One, they found a cause, a wedge issue with Greystone's custody issue. [[05:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21446.98s)]
*  And now they had just a real super weapon in Tim Stone. [[05:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21453.059999999998s)]
*  All the energy and organizational ability that Tim Stone had used for Jim and for the [[05:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21459.46s)]
*  temple for years were now turned against him. [[05:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21464.5s)]
*  And Jim knew this was bad news. [[05:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21469.94s)]
*  He knew what his former lawyer was capable of. [[05:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21471.379999999997s)]
*  Tim Stone was a very smart guy, very capable guy, and Jim was afraid of him. [[05:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21473.66s)]
*  The defectors started an organization they called the Concerned Relatives, but for many [[05:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21481.66s)]
*  of these people, the fight was much more personal. [[05:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21486.22s)]
*  People who come out of something like People's Temple, and this is true of other cults too, [[05:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21491.22s)]
*  you see it as a pattern. [[05:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21495.06s)]
*  And this isn't universally true of all the Concerned Relatives, but it's a pattern you [[05:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21497.58s)]
*  see with many of them and it holds again with other organizations. [[05:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21501.74s)]
*  They're often looking for ways to rationalize and explain how they could have been sucked [[05:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21504.940000000002s)]
*  into something like this, how they could have put up with and done so many terrible things [[05:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21509.260000000002s)]
*  for so long. [[05:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21515.74s)]
*  You come out of a group like this and you go back to your family. [[05:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21519.100000000002s)]
*  Maybe people you've done terrible things to. [[05:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21523.140000000003s)]
*  These people very often were stealing money from their families. [[05:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21524.86s)]
*  They were telling them they'd never speak to them again, and if the families tried to [[05:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21529.06s)]
*  pull them out of the church, they'd make accusations against them. [[05:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21533.940000000002s)]
*  You had people making, accusing their parents of child molestation just to force their parents [[05:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21536.9s)]
*  to back off. [[05:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21542.140000000003s)]
*  People who had been doing a lot of bad things and things that they now regret to a great [[05:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21545.58s)]
*  supreme degree, and now they're going back to that world and asking those people to take [[05:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21551.5s)]
*  them back and understand where they were coming from. [[05:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21555.9s)]
*  And they also have to salvage some self-respect of their own. [[05:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21563.38s)]
*  And one of the things that you see, and again this isn't universally true, but it's mostly [[05:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21569.5s)]
*  true of the people who came out of the temple. [[05:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21575.420000000002s)]
*  One of the things that really stands out when you listen to those who left the temple before [[05:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21578.34s)]
*  the last day is that virtually none of them take any responsibility at all for their role [[05:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21582.420000000002s)]
*  in the disaster. [[05:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21587.62s)]
*  The people who left were almost all part of the educated white inner circle, the people [[05:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21590.46s)]
*  who had built the church and made all this possible. [[05:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21595.38s)]
*  They were the ones with the families to go back to, or money stashed away, or a college [[05:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21599.38s)]
*  education so that they could get themselves a job again after being out of the market [[06:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21603.3s)]
*  for a long time. [[06:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21608.26s)]
*  And so they had a reason and a means to leave when things started getting difficult. [[06:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21609.54s)]
*  For the old black people whose lives had been, they came out of the Jim Crow South and ended [[06:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21617.18s)]
*  up alone in an Oakland ghetto in their later years. [[06:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21621.54s)]
*  Or you were one of the people, an old lady who donated her house to the temple to take [[06:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21627.94s)]
*  up in one of the temple communes, or a single mother who was in the church because it was [[06:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21632.3s)]
*  a decent environment for her kids. [[06:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21638.42s)]
*  The temple might not have been the paradise it was advertised to be, but in many ways [[06:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21641.14s)]
*  it represented an improvement in their circumstances, or at least the hope for an improvement. [[06:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21645.899999999998s)]
*  For them, very often leaving meant going back to some project apartment or going to live [[06:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21652.66s)]
*  out their last years in a decrepit state hospital alone. [[06:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21659.02s)]
*  If any of them had any property or assets, they donated it to the church on the promise [[06:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21664.14s)]
*  that the temple was going to take care of them, so they had nothing. [[06:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21668.14s)]
*  These people had no reason and no means to leave, and for the most part they didn't. [[06:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21672.5s)]
*  One way to summarize the story of People's Temple, and this is maybe too harsh, but it's [[06:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21679.260000000002s)]
*  a bunch of well-educated, middle-class political radicals who lured a bunch of desperate black [[06:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21684.94s)]
*  people into their movement by lying, cheating, and stealing, and then set that movement on [[06:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21691.3s)]
*  the course for an iceberg, and then many of them hopped into lifeboats and bailed before [[06:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21697.78s)]
*  it hit. [[06:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21702.62s)]
*  When you see these people, and again, this is a, you know, look, maybe I'm being too [[06:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21705.379999999997s)]
*  judgmental here, and I have really tried hard throughout telling this story to keep [[06:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21710.62s)]
*  away from the feelings that crop up when I think about this part of the story. [[06:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21715.98s)]
*  But when you see these people interviewed and read their books, they all play the victim. [[06:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21723.739999999998s)]
*  Like they weren't in those struggle sessions beating on people. [[06:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21728.899999999998s)]
*  Like they weren't rummaging through an old black lady's trash to find her medication [[06:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21732.3s)]
*  bottle so that Jim could trick her into thinking he could perform miracles, which gave him [[06:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21736.54s)]
*  the credibility needed so that when he said, follow me out into the jungle, she thought [[06:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21741.58s)]
*  that was a good idea. [[06:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21746.420000000002s)]
*  Almost to a person, it's, oh, it was all Jim Jones. [[06:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21749.7s)]
*  We were all just brainwashed. [[06:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21753.38s)]
*  We were tricked. [[06:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21754.58s)]
*  In fact, our problem is that we were too idealistic. [[06:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21755.98s)]
*  That was our problem. [[06:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21759.74s)]
*  invested in social justice that he was able to use that to manipulate us. [[06:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21761.74s)]
*  As if that somehow explains lying to old women or beating children or screaming insults at [[06:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21767.58s)]
*  a young woman when she's being stripped and humiliated in one of your meetings. [[06:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21773.02s)]
*  You don't get a hint from most of these people of, you know, my God, what did we do here? [[06:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21778.7s)]
*  What did we contribute to? [[06:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21786.300000000003s)]
*  Look, I get it. [[06:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21790.14s)]
*  It would be hard. [[06:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21791.14s)]
*  You know, it's much easier to convince yourself than an evil bad man took advantage of your [[06:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21792.34s)]
*  good intentions. [[06:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21797.26s)]
*  And once you've settled on that story, it's natural to get angry and want revenge. [[06:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21799.3s)]
*  And that's the vibe you get from many of the people calling themselves a concerned relatives. [[06:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21804.899999999998s)]
*  And some of them did have relatives and they were certainly concerned about them. [[06:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21808.899999999998s)]
*  And obviously they were right about the nature of the temple as they knew better than anyone. [[06:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21813.3s)]
*  But they went hard. [[06:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21819.22s)]
*  I mean, that's really the point of why I'm telling you this is when they organized up [[06:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21820.86s)]
*  and went at the temple, they went hard. [[06:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21825.62s)]
*  The group hired lawyers and began lobbying politicians to take action against the temple. [[06:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21828.74s)]
*  They engaged a private investigator to go down to Guyana and look at the Jonestown. [[06:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21833.62s)]
*  They began a coordinated media campaign to plant negative stories about the temple in [[06:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21838.7s)]
*  the press. [[06:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21842.86s)]
*  They sent their accusations of abuse to law enforcement and in some cases seem to have [[06:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21845.06s)]
*  embellished their accounts, which, you know, again is understandable from one perspective. [[06:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21850.100000000002s)]
*  If you know the temple is dangerous and you can't get anybody to take action, maybe you [[06:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21856.300000000003s)]
*  say whatever you got to say to get someone to pay attention. [[06:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21861.22s)]
*  They lobbied the IRS to take away the temple's religious tax exemption. [[06:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21865.120000000003s)]
*  They contacted the American Medical Association about decertifying the Jonestown physician [[06:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21869.46s)]
*  who had gotten his medical degree from a Mexican university. [[06:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21875.62s)]
*  They went to the Social Security Administration with accusations of fraud to get them to stop [[06:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21879.64s)]
*  sending checks to the old people in Jonestown. [[06:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21883.86s)]
*  They were even at times monitoring the temple's use of shortwave radio for any technical use [[06:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21886.86s)]
*  violations that they could forward to the FCC. [[06:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21891.66s)]
*  The assault was heavy. [[06:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21893.96s)]
*  The San Francisco temple was on the radio every week with news of a new letter from [[06:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21897.66s)]
*  the government or a court summons or a lawsuit. [[06:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21903.7s)]
*  Jim was convinced that these former members had entered into league with the right-wing [[06:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21907.42s)]
*  forces in the government to destroy the temple. [[06:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21910.66s)]
*  And then in September 1977, the Jonestown radio room received word that Greystone had [[06:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21914.7s)]
*  gotten a judge to order Jim Jones to return their son to her. [[06:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21920.94s)]
*  And that Jim was not prepared to do. [[06:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21925.86s)]
*  And Jim's crazy response to that order let the concerned relatives know that they had [[06:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21928.66s)]
*  found an issue that they could use as an anvil to hammer the temple out of existence. [[06:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21934.3s)]
*  Again, Jim Jones believed that this was his son. [[06:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21940.82s)]
*  He did believe that, apparently. [[06:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21944.5s)]
*  He was not going to compromise on this issue. [[06:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21946.58s)]
*  And he believed that as long as the government of Guyana took his side, or at least didn't [[06:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21949.58s)]
*  intervene, that the boy would be safe with him in Jonestown. [[06:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21953.7s)]
*  The custody lawyer that had been retained by the Stones flew to Georgetown and appeared [[06:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21958.780000000002s)]
*  in a Guyanese courtroom. [[06:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21963.02s)]
*  And a local judge in Georgetown issued an order for Jim to appear and make his case [[06:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21964.5s)]
*  for why the boy shouldn't be sent back to the United States. [[06:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21969.920000000002s)]
*  And so Jim had several members of his inner circle write affidavits accusing Grace of [[06:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21974.62s)]
*  being an unfit mother. [[06:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21979.18s)]
*  I mean, everything you can think of, of molesting her son, any crime you can think of. [[06:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21980.18s)]
*  Several of those blank pieces of paper with the signatures of concerned relatives were [[06:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21987.420000000002s)]
*  filled in with heinous confessions and circulated. [[06:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21991.66s)]
*  And Jim needed the total support of his people for this fight. [[06:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21996.82s)]
*  And he told them that the seizure of John Victor, his boy, was just a trial balloon. [[06:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=21999.94s)]
*  And that once the precedent was established that children could be taken out of Jonestown [[06:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22005.420000000002s)]
*  on account of accusations against the leader, him, that all of their children would be vulnerable. [[06:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22009.42s)]
*  At meetings he read the phony confessions to the crowd to show them the nature of the [[06:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22016.219999999998s)]
*  people that he was dealing with. [[06:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22021.899999999998s)]
*  His favorite line was always that the people who had left were so eaten up with guilt at [[06:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22025.239999999998s)]
*  having betrayed socialism, betrayed him personally, that the only way they could cope with it [[06:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22030.12s)]
*  was to transform that guilt into hate. [[06:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22035.66s)]
*  And they needed to destroy Jonestown just so that it wasn't out there as a constant [[06:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22038.68s)]
*  reminder of their betrayal. [[06:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22043.48s)]
*  That was his favorite line. [[06:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22044.96s)]
*  I think he believed that actually. [[06:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22047.08s)]
*  He used it so often. [[06:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22048.32s)]
*  He told the people that their enemies were hiring mercenaries to kidnap their children [[06:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22051.22s)]
*  and to assassinate him. [[06:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22055.98s)]
*  Jim had his teenage son, Jim Jones Jr., stage an assassination attack on him. [[06:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22059.18s)]
*  Jimmy hid in the jungle. [[06:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22063.38s)]
*  When Jim came out of his cottage one time, his son fired a few rifle shots in the air [[06:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22065.18s)]
*  and he had to hit the deck because his dad's bodyguards who didn't know what was going [[06:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22070.02s)]
*  on started firing their shotguns in his direction. [[06:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22073.88s)]
*  He would do this many times. [[06:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22076.68s)]
*  I know you think people should catch on. [[06:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22080.100000000002s)]
*  I know a lot of it sounds hokey and ridiculous from far away, but realize that to the people [[06:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22082.04s)]
*  who are absorbed in the story, this is their daily reality. [[06:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22086.68s)]
*  They're not looking at it with any objectivity. [[06:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22090.72s)]
*  They're in it. [[06:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22093.82s)]
*  These are people who believed in him enough to follow him out there. [[06:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22095.9s)]
*  They're out in this remote jungle camp and he's telling you that there are enemies that [[06:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22099.2s)]
*  want to destroy us and want him dead. [[06:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22103.48s)]
*  From time to time, there are gunshots coming from out in the jungle towards Jonestown. [[06:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22106.22s)]
*  Everybody in charge, the whole leadership is on the same page. [[06:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22111.54s)]
*  They all seem alarmed by this. [[06:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22113.7s)]
*  They're all saying it came from enemies out there. [[06:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22115.8s)]
*  A real siege mentality developed. [[06:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22118.14s)]
*  In possession of the order from the Guyanese court, the Stone's lawyer flew out to Port [[06:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22123.42s)]
*  Kaituma and made his way to the Jonestown gate to present Jim Jones with the order to [[06:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22127.46s)]
*  appear. [[06:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22131.42s)]
*  The guards wouldn't let him in and they refused to accept the paperwork. [[06:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22132.859999999997s)]
*  As this is going on, Jim radios Georgetown and tells his people there to contact the [[06:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22139.179999999997s)]
*  deputy prime minister who so far had been very friendly to the temple, but they were [[06:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22143.62s)]
*  away on business in the United States. [[06:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22149.34s)]
*  This is just an example of how out of control Jim's paranoia is. [[06:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22152.34s)]
*  The paranoid mind works the way conspiracy theories work. [[06:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22159.34s)]
*  Take every piece of information and stitch it together into a story that always ends [[06:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22163.1s)]
*  up at the worst possible outcome, justifying your fears. [[06:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22167.22s)]
*  Jim believed that the only possible explanation for the appearance of the Stone's lawyer and [[06:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22171.58s)]
*  the adverse ruling in the Georgetown court at the same time that the deputy prime minister [[06:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22176.94s)]
*  was in the United States, it could only mean that the concerned relatives were now working [[06:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22182.46s)]
*  with the CIA and other government agencies who were leaning on the Guyanese government [[06:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22187.3s)]
*  to bring him down. [[06:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22191.66s)]
*  On September 7th, one day before the Guyanese judge had ordered him to produce the Boyan [[06:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22194.66s)]
*  court, word goes around Jonestown that everybody's to drop their work immediately and come to [[06:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22201.5s)]
*  the pavilion. [[06:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22208.14s)]
*  Now it's only 430 in the afternoon or so. [[06:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22209.14s)]
*  It's two hours before the end of a typical work day, so people aren't asking any questions. [[06:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22212.22s)]
*  They're just happy about that. [[06:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22216.66s)]
*  But as they walked with the tools back to the center of the village, they begin to hear [[06:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22218.7s)]
*  shouts and screams and see other people running back toward the center of camp and pretty [[06:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22222.78s)]
*  soon everybody's running. [[06:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22226.66s)]
*  The people working out in the fields were the furthest ones away and so when they finally [[06:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22228.82s)]
*  got there, they got to the pavilion to find the old people and the kids who had already [[06:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22232.86s)]
*  been in the village lined up in a loose formation and they're all holding machetes and shovels [[06:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22237.38s)]
*  and clubs and hatchets and butcher knives. [[06:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22242.38s)]
*  And Jim's on the PA system screaming that the settlement's about to be attacked at any [[06:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22245.18s)]
*  moment and everyone has to arm themselves immediately and prepare for an immediate fight. [[06:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22250.26s)]
*  About two dozen of the young men are armed with rifles and pistols and crossbows and [[06:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22256.98s)]
*  they're patrolling the lines, barking orders like drill sergeants. [[06:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22261.02s)]
*  Jim orders one of his sons and another boy to take a duffel bag with gold bars in it [[06:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22264.94s)]
*  out into the jungle and if the camp is overrun and all hope is lost and everybody's killed, [[06:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22268.92s)]
*  they're to make their way to the Soviet embassy to donate that gold to the Russians as a final [[06:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22273.579999999998s)]
*  gesture to show the temple's commitment to the cause. [[06:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22278.02s)]
*  They're given rifles and told to shoot anybody who tries to stop them. [[06:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22281.76s)]
*  Jim comes out and addresses all his civilian soldiers. [[06:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22286.18s)]
*  He tells them that well-armed mercenaries hired by the concerned relatives and assisted [[06:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22288.58s)]
*  by the Guyanese military were surrounding Jonestown right at that moment as he spoke. [[06:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22294.54s)]
*  And they were there to kidnap John Victor and other children and they had orders to [[06:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22299.58s)]
*  exterminate everyone in Jonestown if there was any resistance. [[06:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22303.94s)]
*  So the people are deployed in squads out along the treeline. [[06:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22308.82s)]
*  You got 70-year-old ladies out here holding shovels and hatchets. [[06:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22314.460000000003s)]
*  I mean, this is what's going on. [[06:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22320.460000000003s)]
*  And they're out there told to prepare for a hand-to-hand fight to the death with whatever [[06:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22324.34s)]
*  comes and so they get out in position and everybody just waits. [[06:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22327.780000000002s)]
*  Hours go by and the sun is going down and after a full day's work, the people are exhausted. [[06:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22333.420000000002s)]
*  I mean, they were exhausted before. [[06:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22339.300000000003s)]
*  They're always exhausted, but Jim and his staff stay on them. [[06:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22341.02s)]
*  The enemy's just out of sight, just waiting for an opportunity. [[06:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22344.9s)]
*  Food and water passed around and eventually the people have been out there as night falls [[06:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22350.14s)]
*  for so long that some of the old people and children begin to fall out involuntarily. [[06:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22356.100000000002s)]
*  And so the community's broken up into shifts and some people tried to get some rest while [[06:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22360.82s)]
*  the others remained on watch. [[06:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22365.78s)]
*  Jim and his staff didn't rest. [[06:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22368.54s)]
*  Occasionally, they would go back to his cottage radio room for injections of amphetamines [[06:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22370.22s)]
*  and to talk with San Francisco or to try to get a hold of the Guyanese government in Georgetown, [[06:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22374.98s)]
*  but hardly anybody was really able to rest. [[06:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22379.9s)]
*  They believed Jim when he said an attack was imminent. [[06:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22383.34s)]
*  They thought their camp was being surrounded by mercenaries who were coming to kidnap their [[06:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22387.7s)]
*  children and kill them all. [[06:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22391.22s)]
*  And if anybody didn't believe Jim, they believed others. [[06:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22394.3s)]
*  Angela Davis, the famous radical hero to all temple members. [[06:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22398.82s)]
*  She called Jonestown during this episode by telephone and was patched in over the PA system [[06:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22404.1s)]
*  so that everybody could hear what she said. [[06:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22409.9s)]
*  Quote, this is Angela Davis. [[06:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22412.66s)]
*  I would like to say to my friend Jim Jones and all my sisters and brothers from People's [[06:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22416.42s)]
*  Temple who are in Guyana there, know that there are people here, not only in the Bay [[06:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22420.38s)]
*  but across the country who are supporting you, who are with you. [[06:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22425.3s)]
*  I can personally speak for the National Alliance Against Racism and Political Oppression in [[06:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22428.82s)]
*  cities throughout the country. [[06:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22433.46s)]
*  I know you are in a very difficult situation right now and there is a conspiracy, a very [[06:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22435.54s)]
*  profound conspiracy designed to destroy the contributions which you have made to our struggle. [[06:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22440.62s)]
*  And this is why I must tell you that we feel we are under attack as well. [[06:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22446.36s)]
*  When you are attacked, it is because of your progressive stand and we feel that it is directly [[06:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22450.26s)]
*  an attack against us as well. [[06:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22455.1s)]
*  We will do everything in our power to ensure your ability to keep on struggling. [[06:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22457.42s)]
*  We know that you are going to win and in the final analysis that we are all going to win. [[06:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22461.98s)]
*  End quote. [[06:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22467.34s)]
*  They got more calls from people like Black Panther founder Huey Newton as well as from [[06:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22468.34s)]
*  Eldridge Cleaver and others, all of them giving the same message, confirming Jim's paranoid [[06:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22475.8s)]
*  claims. [[06:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22482.3s)]
*  And again, if the people doubted Jim or his staff, these calls were from people that they [[06:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22483.3s)]
*  worshipped. [[06:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22490.3s)]
*  These were heroes to these people. [[06:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22491.78s)]

*  malicious statements that continue to be made about our community here in Guyana. [[06:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22559.34s)]

*  I am almost finished. [[06:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22739.6s)]
*  This has been the unanimous vote of the collective community here in Guyana. [[06:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22742.84s)]

*  the right to exist free from harassment and the kind of indignities we have been subjected [[06:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22769.16s)]

*  At night armed squads patrolled the perimeter and people gathered in the pavilion for all [[06:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22788.239999999998s)]
*  night meetings. [[06:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22792.64s)]
*  Jim ranted and raved for hours at a time. [[06:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22794.84s)]
*  He hadn't slept in days. [[06:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22798.32s)]
*  He was irrational, screaming about his enemies one minute then breaking down in tears the [[06:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22800.559999999998s)]
*  next moment. [[06:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22805.84s)]
*  And throughout most of this he is holding a loaded handgun. [[06:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22807.52s)]
*  He is waving it wildly over the heads of the assembled crowd pointing it at people who [[06:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22810.559999999998s)]
*  are nodding off from lack of sleep wondering aloud how many traitors are out there in the [[06:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22815.76s)]
*  crowd threatening to shoot them. [[06:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22819.8s)]
*  Just remember nothing works than putting somebody in a corner when they have tried over and [[06:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22822.64s)]
*  over and over to do righteousness and no one receive it. [[06:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22832.239999999998s)]
*  You get them in a corner they are extremely dangerous. [[06:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22836.0s)]
*  Extremely dangerous aren't they? [[06:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22840.92s)]
*  And I think you can sense the hands of these people that we are nonviolent people but we [[06:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22841.92s)]
*  are extremely dangerous. [[06:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22846.079999999998s)]
*  Because they have been set up with anarchy and set up with rebellion and set up with [[06:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22847.52s)]
*  selfishness. [[06:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22854.52s)]
*  Just remember you don't have anything on me that I care about because everything that [[06:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22855.52s)]
*  you have on me I have let it all hang right out for everybody to see. [[06:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22866.84s)]
*  Now you get worried about yourself. [[06:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22871.84s)]
*  I don't mind losing my life what about you? [[06:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22875.6s)]
*  I don't mind losing my reputation what about you? [[06:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22878.6s)]
*  I don't mind being tortured what about you? [[06:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22882.6s)]
*  I am just no longer afraid and I have lost interest in this whole world of capitalist [[06:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22887.6s)]
*  sin and racism I have lost interest in it. [[06:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22894.08s)]
*  So if somebody wants to make me stay in it by compromising with filthy minded people [[06:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22899.76s)]
*  that cannot even have respect for somebody that would die for even his enemies and they [[06:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22904.76s)]
*  want to cause anarchy in our midst I would just as soon bring it all to a gallant of [[06:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22910.76s)]
*  glorious screaming end. [[06:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22916.76s)]
*  Just bring it to a screeching stop in a one glorious moment of triumph. [[06:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22919.76s)]
*  So you think about it. [[06:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22925.76s)]
*  You know what I am talking about. [[06:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22929.76s)]
*  Shift. [[06:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22938.76s)]
*  Shift. [[06:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22941.76s)]
*  But I am glad I am awfully glad for one thing that we are not cursed with immortality. [[06:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22944.76s)]
*  Now that would be one god damn miserable thing if you had to be assured that you could never [[06:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22956.719999999998s)]

*  That is a form of death. [[06:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22984.68s)]
*  They can put you in shit up and drown you in it but at some point you go unconscious [[06:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22986.68s)]
*  into sleep and you don't feel it. [[06:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22992.68s)]
*  They can electrocute you or they can do what they did to that man last night on that movie [[06:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22994.68s)]
*  that was a real life movie and everybody should study it some place if we live through this [[06:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=22999.68s)]
*  white night which we likely will. [[06:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23002.68s)]
*  That is why every nurse should report anybody that makes a big fuss about taking a shot [[06:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23005.68s)]
*  or having something on the doctor has to look at somebody's asshole and they make a big [[06:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23011.64s)]
*  fuss or in their vagina or he has to push on something and it hurts and they scream [[06:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23015.64s)]
*  that person ought to be reported because that person is a potential traitor. [[06:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23020.64s)]

*  I want people to stay alert during a war situation. [[06:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23030.64s)]
*  It is a democracy and everybody has to participate in what the hell is going on. [[06:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23035.64s)]
*  You have a privilege to have land to fight for, you have a privilege to have a cause [[06:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23040.6s)]

*  Vincent had something for me which he got in in time. [[06:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23089.559999999998s)]
*  Jerry the question would be if the fascists were coming up the road right now [[06:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23095.52s)]
*  and we were going to lay down our lives and fight for it [[06:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23100.52s)]
*  you say you would give your life for your child's [[06:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23104.52s)]
*  but would you leave it for the fascists to have? [[06:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23107.52s)]
*  What would you do in that case? [[06:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23110.52s)]
*  If it came to that I would have to take her life. [[06:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23113.52s)]
*  Fine. [[06:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23117.48s)]
*  You understand that? [[06:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23120.48s)]
*  But she's so old she'd fight. [[06:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23123.48s)]
*  How old is your child? [[06:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23126.48s)]
*  Eleven. [[06:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23129.48s)]
*  She passed the age. [[06:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23130.48s)]
*  We fight at eleven. [[06:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23131.48s)]
*  It's under that. [[06:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23133.48s)]
*  We consider that. [[06:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23134.48s)]
*  She would take up a cutlass and fight till she was dead [[06:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23135.48s)]
*  unless it came to an overwhelming invasion [[06:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23138.48s)]
*  then we would gently put them to sleep [[06:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23141.48s)]
*  which we have, they never know what hit them [[06:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23145.44s)]
*  we are already prepared for that [[06:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23148.44s)]
*  people who are really loving and a father who's genuinely compassionate [[06:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23150.44s)]
*  is prepared for all such emergencies. [[06:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23153.44s)]
*  So night fades into day and back into night until the people lose track [[06:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23155.44s)]
*  and one day Jim announces that their situation has become impossible [[06:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23158.44s)]
*  they can no longer hold the camp [[06:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23161.44s)]
*  and orders everybody transported to Port Kaituma [[06:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23163.44s)]
*  so that they can all cram somehow aboard the Jonestown boat [[06:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23166.44s)]
*  and make their way to Cuba to request asylum. [[06:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23169.44s)]
*  So people start loading onto the trailer to be dragged to the port [[06:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23173.399999999998s)]
*  elderly and children first [[06:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23177.399999999998s)]
*  and when one of the first batches arrives [[06:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23179.399999999998s)]
*  an old lady fell on the boat and broke her hip [[06:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23181.399999999998s)]
*  and so Jim orders everybody back to the camp [[06:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23184.399999999998s)]
*  and aborts that plan, nothing more said about Cuba. [[06:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23186.399999999998s)]
*  Then Jim's on the radio to his wife Marceline [[06:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23191.399999999998s)]
*  who's back in San Francisco and she is freaking out [[06:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23194.399999999998s)]
*  she's trying to talk them down and get them to relax [[06:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23197.399999999998s)]
*  says nobody's coming to kidnap the Jonestown children [[06:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23201.36s)]
*  but she cannot get this guy to calm down [[06:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23204.36s)]
*  and she realizes soon that [[06:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23206.36s)]
*  part of the reason that that's the case [[06:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23209.36s)]
*  is the rest of his staff is going just as crazy as he is [[06:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23211.36s)]
*  and they're all reinforcing this with each other [[06:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23214.36s)]
*  and so in a panic Marceline somehow manages to locate [[06:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23216.36s)]
*  the Guyanese Deputy Prime Minister in the United States [[06:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23220.36s)]
*  who happened to be in Indiana at the time [[06:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23223.36s)]
*  I don't know how she found him [[06:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23226.36s)]
*  she talks to him and of course he doesn't know what to make [[06:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23228.36s)]
*  of what she's saying [[06:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23230.32s)]
*  says of course there's no imminent plan [[06:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23231.32s)]
*  to attack Jonestown [[06:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23234.32s)]
*  but she takes down his statement word for word [[06:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23236.32s)]
*  and she reads it to Jim and the staff over the radio [[06:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23238.32s)]
*  and that official got a hold of the courts [[06:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23242.32s)]
*  the judiciary in Georgetown [[06:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23245.32s)]
*  got that judge to reschedule a new court hearing for November [[06:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23247.32s)]
*  and then the Jonestown communities called together [[06:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23251.32s)]
*  so that Jim could read the statement to them [[06:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23254.32s)]
*  and tell them that they had won [[06:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23256.32s)]
*  he said their show of force had demonstrated to the enemy [[06:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23258.28s)]
*  that Jonestown would not go down with a fight [[06:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23261.28s)]
*  and they'd back down [[06:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23263.28s)]
*  the people had to remain vigilant [[06:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23267.28s)]
*  but they were allowed to return to their usual schedules [[06:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23268.28s)]
*  after six days [[06:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23271.28s)]
*  and so ended the first of what became known as [[06:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23273.28s)]
*  Jonestown's White Nights [[06:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23276.28s)]
*  Jim reveled in the victory [[06:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23280.28s)]
*  but he warned that the enemy was not going to stop coming [[06:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23281.28s)]
*  but I would like to tell you [[06:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23284.28s)]
*  that you have a chance of victory in communism [[06:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23286.239999999998s)]
*  that you never had [[06:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23287.239999999998s)]
*  could you tell me any place else [[06:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23288.239999999998s)]
*  where they take a black woman and two men [[06:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23289.239999999998s)]
*  and I said you're not taking them [[06:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23292.239999999998s)]
*  you tell him that I quit talking to him [[06:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23294.239999999998s)]
*  I said piss on him [[06:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23296.239999999998s)]
*  I went all above him [[06:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23297.239999999998s)]
*  and I said I'm going to tell you [[06:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23299.239999999998s)]
*  you better release those people [[06:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23300.239999999998s)]
*  drop those papers [[06:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23302.239999999998s)]
*  don't you come and look for them [[06:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23303.239999999998s)]
*  because we're not going to be alive out here [[06:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23304.239999999998s)]
*  if you do [[06:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23307.239999999998s)]
*  we're going to raise hell [[06:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23308.239999999998s)]
*  we're not going to eat [[06:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23309.239999999998s)]
*  and then we're going to do some other things [[06:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23310.239999999998s)]
*  I didn't tell them what [[06:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23311.239999999998s)]
*  and by God it wasn't about [[06:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23312.239999999998s)]
*  we won that one about seven hours later [[06:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23315.2s)]
*  they said well [[06:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23316.2s)]
*  they got a hold of us real quick [[06:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23317.2s)]
*  they always come on tough [[06:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23318.2s)]
*  there's only one thing you can do in life [[06:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23319.2s)]
*  not go against the movement [[06:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23321.2s)]
*  for Christ's sake [[06:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23322.2s)]
*  don't be a crazy nigger [[06:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23323.2s)]
*  just for your own right [[06:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23324.2s)]

*  some two years back when she ran off [[06:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23665.4s)]

*  Jim Jones had set aside for his son's future education [[06:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23669.4s)]
*  when she returned months later [[06:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23671.4s)]
*  and demanded to see John [[06:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23673.4s)]
*  she flung the child back into Jim's arms [[06:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23675.4s)]
*  saying, take him, he's yours [[06:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23677.4s)]
*  in the presence of several witnesses [[06:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23679.4s)]
*  Jim suffered days of physical symptoms [[06:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23681.4s)]
*  so severe in the wake of the incident [[06:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23684.4s)]
*  many around him feared he could die of heart failure [[06:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23686.4s)]
*  from the shock of witnessing such gross cruelty [[06:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23688.4s)]
*  against his son [[06:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23690.4s)]
*  Mr. President [[06:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23692.4s)]
*  this would seem to make no rational sense [[06:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23694.4s)]
*  but there are other undisclosed pressures [[06:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23696.4s)]
*  being brought to bear on the situation [[06:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23698.4s)]
*  Tim Stone wasn't just a passing member of People's Temple [[06:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23700.4s)]
*  he was its legal counsel and prided himself [[06:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23703.4s)]
*  on being a model member for ten years [[06:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23706.4s)]
*  as recently as August 1977 [[06:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23708.4s)]
*  he was quoted as saying [[06:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23711.4s)]
*  I have always made known my estate [[06:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23713.4s)]
*  for Jim Jones [[06:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23715.4s)]
*  his sudden unaccountable [[06:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23717.4s)]
*  180 degree turn now [[06:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23719.4s)]
*  with no further contact with Jim Jones [[06:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23721.4s)]
*  People's Temple or its members [[06:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23723.4s)]
*  is absolutely suspect [[06:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23725.4s)]
*  yet we do know during that time [[06:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23727.4s)]
*  he was threatened by certain individuals [[06:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23729.4s)]
*  with prosecution which was already underway [[06:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23731.4s)]
*  for some law he allegedly violated [[06:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23733.4s)]
*  since his sudden turn [[06:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23735.4s)]
*  that prosecution has been withheld [[06:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23737.4s)]
*  end quote [[06:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23739.4s)]
*  that's just a bit of it [[06:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23741.4s)]
*  the letter goes on for 12 pages [[06:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23743.4s)]
*  describing [[06:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23745.4s)]
*  every petty grievance [[06:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23747.4s)]
*  the concerned relatives and various temple members [[06:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23749.4s)]
*  have with each other and all the attacks against the temple [[06:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23751.4s)]
*  and claiming that it's all [[06:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23753.4s)]
*  the result of an international conspiracy [[06:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23755.4s)]
*  involving Interpol [[06:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23757.4s)]
*  and agencies of the US government [[06:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23759.4s)]
*  as well as private interests [[06:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23761.4s)]
*  and it says that the president has to intervene [[06:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23763.4s)]
*  if not out of humanitarian concern [[06:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23765.4s)]
*  then in the interest of the government [[06:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23767.4s)]
*  because members of congress [[06:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23769.4s)]
*  were being unwittingly dragged into helping [[06:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23771.4s)]
*  a vicious and evil criminal conspiracy [[06:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23773.4s)]
*  which would be a huge embarrassment [[06:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23775.4s)]
*  to them once it's all exposed [[06:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23777.4s)]
*  there's no reason to believe that this letter ever made it to Carter's desk [[06:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23779.4s)]
*  but you've got to imagine the state of mind [[06:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23785.4s)]
*  of the people who [[06:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23789.4s)]
*  you know, believed it was a good idea to send this [[06:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23791.4s)]
*  who thought that if it did make it to Carter [[06:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23793.4s)]
*  that would change everything [[06:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23795.4s)]
*  and they'd be saved [[06:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23797.4s)]
*  as if the secretary of state's going to rush into Carter's bedroom at 2am [[06:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23799.4s)]
*  waving it over his head like [[06:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23803.4s)]
*  sir, we have a situation [[06:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23805.4s)]
*  you know [[06:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23807.4s)]
*  and Carter's going to call an emergency session of congress [[06:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23809.4s)]
*  and give a speech from the Oval Office [[06:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23811.4s)]
*  like my fellow Americans [[06:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23813.4s)]
*  I've been made aware of a dangerous conspiracy [[06:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23815.4s)]
*  against People's Temple [[06:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23817.4s)]
*  and their wonderful pastor, Reverend Jim Jones [[06:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23819.4s)]
*  you know, it appears [[06:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23821.4s)]
*  his former members have allied with dark international forces [[06:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23823.4s)]
*  and treasonous agents within our own government [[06:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23827.4s)]
*  to bring down People's Temple [[06:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23829.4s)]
*  by falsely claiming that Reverend Jones' son [[06:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23831.4s)]
*  is not really his own [[06:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23833.4s)]
*  you know [[06:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23835.4s)]
*  but they're [[06:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23837.4s)]
*  cut off from the outside world [[06:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23839.4s)]
*  in their own heads [[06:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23841.4s)]
*  and reinforcing every crazy idea [[06:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23843.4s)]
*  each one of them has [[06:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23845.4s)]
*  you know, they're spending their nights [[06:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23847.4s)]
*  fantasizing about all the plots against them [[06:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23849.4s)]
*  he's telling the people that back in the United States [[06:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23853.4s)]
*  the fascists have finally made their move [[06:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23855.4s)]
*  and every black person in the United States [[06:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23857.4s)]
*  is being rounded up and thrown into concentration camps [[06:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23859.4s)]
*  and Neo-Nazis and the KKK are working with the government to achieve this [[06:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23861.4s)]
*  and Jim [[06:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23863.4s)]
*  told the people that [[06:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23865.4s)]
*  the whole world is watching to see how things go in Jonestown [[06:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23867.4s)]
*  because they were all that remained of the world revolution [[06:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23869.4s)]
*  and again, with [[06:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23871.4s)]
*  all the other leaders backing him up [[06:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23873.4s)]
*  and he's telling the people that [[06:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23875.4s)]
*  the whole world is watching to see how things go in Jonestown [[06:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23877.4s)]

*  famous radicals like Angela Davis [[06:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23885.4s)]

*  with a famous [[06:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23889.4s)]
*  radical attorney like Charles Gary [[06:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23891.4s)]
*  you know, the guy who [[06:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23893.4s)]
*  represented Huey Newton [[06:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23895.4s)]
*  had represented many other famous radicals [[06:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23897.4s)]
*  trying to help them [[06:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23899.4s)]
*  the people believed all this [[06:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23901.4s)]
*  I've got a very very severe headache [[06:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23903.4s)]
*  terribly severe, terribly agonizing [[06:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23905.4s)]
*  severe headache if you want the god damn truth [[06:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23907.4s)]
*  you might say well [[06:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23913.4s)]
*  the death of the movement would be good [[06:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23915.4s)]
*  because then I won't be alive [[06:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23917.4s)]
*  then I can do my thing [[06:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23919.4s)]
*  but why do you take that right? [[06:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23921.4s)]
*  I wish I could take that right [[06:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23923.4s)]
*  but I can't morally take that right [[06:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23925.4s)]
*  I could die tonight then I'd be out of my misery [[06:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23929.4s)]
*  but the death of the movement [[06:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23933.4s)]
*  all over the United States from [[06:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23937.4s)]
*  one end to the other [[06:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23939.4s)]
*  there was a conversation about People's Temple going on [[06:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23941.4s)]
*  they made it, those people made it [[06:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23943.4s)]
*  thousands of socialists over there in Guyana [[06:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23945.4s)]

*  you can know we're the talk of the left [[06:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23957.4s)]
*  they're watching us, the Soviet Union [[06:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23961.4s)]
*  fascinated by us, they come by the Cubans [[06:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23963.4s)]
*  every day in the Soviet Union [[06:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23965.4s)]
*  totally fascinated [[06:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23967.4s)]
*  in fact a little threatened [[06:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23969.4s)]
*  by our goodness [[06:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23971.4s)]
*  and our lack of elitism [[06:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23973.4s)]
*  but they're going to come and study it [[06:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23975.4s)]
*  they said we could be a model [[06:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23977.4s)]

*  that's not the word I want [[06:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23983.4s)]
*  but I'm under too much pressure [[06:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23985.4s)]
*  spellbound, he was [[06:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23987.4s)]

*  Jim Jones took the church [[06:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23991.4s)]

*  people to atheism [[06:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=23995.4s)]

*  he said you mean you [[06:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24005.4s)]
*  he got the church and got them out of atheism [[06:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24007.4s)]
*  he said we haven't been able to do that with the Soviet [[06:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24009.4s)]
*  Union's churches in 50 years [[06:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24011.4s)]
*  and he said we got control [[06:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24013.4s)]
*  over them, we got the funding over them [[06:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24015.4s)]
*  we have to give them the money [[06:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24017.4s)]
*  so that the religion won't become a vulture [[06:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24021.4s)]
*  on the people, make private collections [[06:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24023.4s)]
*  we maintain the church and let them have their religion as much as they need it [[06:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24025.4s)]
*  but he said we cannot get them out of their religion [[06:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24027.4s)]
*  well, the fact is [[06:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24031.4s)]
*  to be humble, some of us have not [[06:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24033.4s)]
*  out of it, but [[06:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24035.4s)]
*  and then you got that paranormal factor that does kind of [[06:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24037.4s)]
*  confuse things [[06:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24039.4s)]
*  it confuses me when I can [[06:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24041.4s)]
*  raise somebody up like [[06:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24043.4s)]

*  paralyzed, I don't mean crippled, paralyzed [[06:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24051.4s)]
*  hey, that troubles me [[06:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24053.4s)]
*  and why three people die in three years [[06:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24055.4s)]
*  like I mentioned in paraparliamentary procedure [[06:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24057.4s)]
*  and each die on March 10th [[06:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24059.4s)]
*  three members of parliament in one small country [[06:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24061.4s)]
*  very weird, but that doesn't make me believe [[06:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24063.4s)]
*  there's any loving God [[06:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24065.4s)]
*  nooo, that's a long [[06:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24067.4s)]
*  jump from my power to heal [[06:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24069.4s)]
*  to believe there's something loving up there [[06:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24071.4s)]
*  cause if there's been something loving up there [[06:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24073.4s)]
*  they'd have left us alone and never made us [[06:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24075.4s)]
*  take the trip in the first place [[06:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24077.4s)]
*  one of the most remarkable things [[06:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24079.4s)]
*  that happened in Jonestown [[06:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24081.4s)]
*  had to do with [[06:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24083.4s)]
*  race and the division of labor [[06:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24085.4s)]
*  it's not a surprise [[06:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24087.4s)]
*  when you know the history of communist experiments [[06:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24089.4s)]
*  but it's always something [[06:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24091.4s)]
*  to see it happen again and again [[06:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24093.4s)]
*  the Russian revolution was [[06:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24095.4s)]
*  led and carried out [[06:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24097.4s)]
*  by intellectuals on behalf of the working class [[06:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24099.4s)]
*  right, but the Soviet Union that resulted from the revolution [[06:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24101.4s)]
*  was just a new caste system [[06:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24103.4s)]
*  with a lot of people [[06:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24105.4s)]
*  was just a new caste system with intellectuals [[06:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24107.4s)]
*  and bureaucrats [[06:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24109.4s)]
*  instead of aristocrats [[06:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24111.4s)]
*  lording over the same workers as before [[06:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24113.4s)]
*  and any workers who pointed that out [[06:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24115.4s)]
*  were labeled enemies of the people [[06:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24117.4s)]
*  and dealt with accordingly [[06:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24119.4s)]
*  in people's temple [[06:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24121.4s)]
*  the inner circle had always been made up [[06:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24123.4s)]
*  pretty much [[06:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24125.4s)]
*  completely of educated white people [[06:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24127.4s)]
*  and the bulk of the [[06:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24129.4s)]
*  membership was [[06:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24131.4s)]
*  African American [[06:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24133.4s)]
*  back in San Francisco that just meant that [[06:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24135.4s)]
*  you know the white people were in the strategy meetings [[06:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24137.4s)]
*  while the rest of the people [[06:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24139.4s)]
*  only showed up on Sundays [[06:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24141.4s)]
*  but in Jonestown everybody had to work [[06:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24143.4s)]
*  and most of the people [[06:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24145.4s)]
*  were doing hard labor [[06:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24147.4s)]
*  in the fields [[06:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24149.4s)]
*  well the inner circle of educated white people [[06:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24151.4s)]
*  you know they were too important for that [[06:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24153.4s)]
*  somebody had to write the curriculum [[06:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24155.4s)]
*  for the mandatory socialism classes [[06:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24157.4s)]
*  somebody had to write up the daily work [[06:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24159.4s)]
*  schedules and manage that [[06:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24161.4s)]
*  and everybody should do what they're best at [[06:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24163.4s)]
*  and so you couldn't [[06:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24165.4s)]
*  very well have the [[06:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24167.4s)]
*  high school dropout from the ghetto [[06:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24169.4s)]
*  managing the Jonestown communications [[06:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24171.4s)]
*  with the Guyanese government right? [[06:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24173.4s)]
*  what kind of sense would that make? [[06:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24175.4s)]
*  and so you ended up with [[06:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24177.4s)]
*  what you ended up with in Jonestown [[06:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24179.4s)]
*  was a virtually all white elite [[06:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24181.4s)]
*  managing the place [[06:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24183.4s)]
*  doing paperwork, writing schedules [[06:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24185.4s)]
*  and overseeing a virtually [[06:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24187.4s)]
*  all black labor force [[06:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24189.4s)]
*  working out in the fields [[06:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24191.4s)]
*  I don't know what you call it [[06:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24193.4s)]
*  when you have a bunch of white overseers [[06:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24195.4s)]
*  managing a bunch of black field laborers [[06:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24197.4s)]
*  who don't get paid [[06:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24199.4s)]
*  and aren't allowed to leave [[06:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24201.4s)]
*  and are punished, often physically punished [[06:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24203.4s)]
*  for not working hard enough [[06:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24205.4s)]
*  but I know what they called that in Mississippi [[06:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24207.4s)]
*  until the Emancipation Proclamation [[06:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24209.4s)]
*  and some of the people noticed this [[06:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24211.4s)]
*  and they complained about it [[06:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24213.4s)]
*  and the response to that [[06:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24215.4s)]
*  tells you all you need to know [[06:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24217.4s)]
*  about where the temple was at [[06:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24219.4s)]
*  Jim warned everybody [[06:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24221.4s)]
*  that the CIA had sent infiltrators [[06:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24223.4s)]
*  into Jonestown [[06:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24225.4s)]
*  and that anybody could be a spy [[06:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24227.4s)]
*  and that they were going to try to sow [[06:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24229.4s)]
*  discontent among the people [[06:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24231.4s)]
*  and to counter this he said that he was [[06:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24233.4s)]
*  sending out spies of his own [[06:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24235.4s)]
*  to go among the people to complain [[06:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24237.4s)]
*  about conditions in Jonestown [[06:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24239.4s)]
*  or to speak negatively about him [[06:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24241.4s)]
*  or to talk about leaving [[06:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24243.4s)]
*  and so he was trying to [[06:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24245.4s)]
*  talk about leaving [[06:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24247.4s)]
*  and these spies of his would be keeping track [[06:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24249.4s)]
*  of everybody who heard them saying these things [[06:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24251.4s)]
*  and if anybody heard [[06:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24253.4s)]
*  and didn't immediately report it [[06:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24255.4s)]
*  he would know that they were traitors [[06:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24257.4s)]
*  it was very effective [[06:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24259.4s)]
*  everybody suspected [[06:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24261.4s)]
*  everyone else of being an informer [[06:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24263.4s)]
*  and if you were unhappy [[06:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24265.4s)]
*  with anything you couldn't share it [[06:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24267.4s)]
*  with even your family or closest friends [[06:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24269.4s)]
*  because they would worry that you were just testing them [[06:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24271.4s)]
*  and if they didn't report you [[06:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24273.4s)]
*  you'd report them [[06:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24275.4s)]
*  the message that the leadership gave [[06:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24279.4s)]
*  to the community was that [[06:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24281.4s)]
*  even the people who weren't spies had to understand [[06:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24283.4s)]
*  that their negativity was contagious [[06:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24285.4s)]
*  complaining about Jonestown was an attack [[06:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24289.4s)]
*  on community morale [[06:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24291.4s)]
*  and in many ways it was more dangerous [[06:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24293.4s)]
*  than attacking the community with weapons [[06:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24295.4s)]
*  for the good of the community it couldn't be allowed [[06:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24299.4s)]
*  to spread and so the punishments [[06:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24301.4s)]
*  began to get more severe [[06:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24303.4s)]
*  young children who misbehaved [[06:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24307.4s)]
*  or complained would sometimes be lowered down [[06:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24309.4s)]
*  a dark well [[06:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24311.4s)]
*  in this well there was a Jonestown [[06:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24313.4s)]
*  myth for the small children that monsters [[06:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24315.4s)]
*  lived down there and they'd be lowered down [[06:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24317.4s)]
*  and dumped into the water and there would be [[06:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24319.4s)]
*  adults hiding down there who would beat them [[06:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24321.4s)]
*  a box was built [[06:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24323.4s)]
*  about the size of a coffin [[06:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24325.4s)]
*  a little bigger and people would be buried [[06:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24327.4s)]
*  alive in it [[06:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24329.4s)]
*  and they would sleep reaching up to the surface for air [[06:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24331.4s)]
*  and they would sometimes be left there for days [[06:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24333.4s)]
*  then the doctors [[06:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24337.4s)]
*  and the nurses put aside a section [[06:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24339.4s)]
*  of their facility called the [[06:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24341.4s)]
*  extended care unit [[06:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24343.4s)]
*  and chronic complainers would be forcibly [[06:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24345.4s)]
*  given thorazine and anti-psychotic [[06:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24347.4s)]
*  and heavily dosed with sedatives [[06:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24349.4s)]
*  and kept in the extended care unit [[06:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24351.4s)]
*  for long periods of time, sometimes [[06:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24353.4s)]
*  weeks [[06:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24355.4s)]
*  and after weeks of that [[06:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24357.4s)]
*  they were released, they knew the consequences of opening [[06:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24359.4s)]
*  their mouths again [[06:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24361.4s)]
*  and as Jonestown [[06:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24363.4s)]
*  gets into its later stages [[06:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24365.4s)]
*  some people were held there [[06:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24367.4s)]
*  the majority of their time, for months [[06:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24369.4s)]
*  once Jim took a [[06:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24373.4s)]
*  shine to a young black girl [[06:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24375.4s)]
*  a 19 year old girl named Shonda James [[06:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24377.4s)]
*  and he let her know that [[06:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24379.4s)]
*  it was her lucky day [[06:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24381.4s)]
*  she got to enjoy the good fortune [[06:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24383.4s)]
*  of joining him in his cottage [[06:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24385.4s)]
*  but the shine had come off Jim Jones [[06:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24387.4s)]
*  by now and she told him [[06:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24389.4s)]
*  that she was flattered, very honored by his attention [[06:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24391.4s)]
*  but she was already involved [[06:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24393.4s)]
*  with somebody else her own age [[06:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24395.4s)]
*  and so Jim told his security staff [[06:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24399.4s)]
*  that she was a security risk [[06:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24401.4s)]
*  and had her seized [[06:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24403.4s)]
*  and drugged and confined [[06:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24405.4s)]
*  to the extended care unit [[06:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24407.4s)]
*  and occasionally [[06:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24409.4s)]
*  his security staff would [[06:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24411.4s)]
*  take this groggy girl [[06:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24413.4s)]
*  and half carry her to his cottage [[06:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24415.4s)]
*  where he would have sex with her body [[06:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24417.4s)]
*  and then they would escort her [[06:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24419.4s)]
*  back to the extended care unit [[06:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24421.4s)]
*  and this went on for some time [[06:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24423.4s)]
*  his son Stephen [[06:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24425.4s)]
*  actually found out about this [[06:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24427.4s)]
*  Stephen's 18, 19 by now [[06:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24429.4s)]
*  and confronted him, screamed at him [[06:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24431.4s)]
*  they actually had a fight over it [[06:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24433.4s)]
*  Stephen jumped on him, he was broken up very quickly [[06:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24435.4s)]
*  but nobody intervened [[06:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24437.4s)]
*  nobody went in there [[06:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24439.4s)]
*  and carried that young girl [[06:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24441.4s)]
*  out of that place [[06:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24443.4s)]
*  physical beatings [[06:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24445.4s)]
*  became general in the camp [[06:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24447.4s)]
*  and Jim Jones didn't need to order them [[06:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24449.4s)]
*  or even be present [[06:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24451.4s)]
*  if someone broke a rule [[06:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24453.4s)]
*  other people would just rush them [[06:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24455.4s)]
*  and start beating them [[06:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24457.4s)]
*  people were punished for small [[06:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24459.4s)]
*  infractions [[06:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24461.4s)]
*  for failing to memorize newspaper [[06:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24463.4s)]
*  stories he had read to them [[06:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24465.4s)]
*  or not making sufficient [[06:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24467.4s)]
*  progress in their Russian language [[06:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24469.4s)]
*  classes which Jim now made mandatory [[06:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24471.4s)]
*  one follower, a young girl [[06:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24475.4s)]
*  about 17 who made it out on the last day [[06:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24477.4s)]
*  Juanita Bogue [[06:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24479.4s)]
*  said that at the time [[06:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24481.4s)]
*  she believed and some other people believed [[06:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24483.4s)]
*  that people were being [[06:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24485.4s)]
*  killed for disobeying rules [[06:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24487.4s)]
*  it wasn't true [[06:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24489.4s)]
*  but she says quote [[06:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24491.4s)]
*  you either worked the day shift or the night shift [[06:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24493.4s)]
*  they kept rotating everything [[06:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24495.4s)]
*  so you couldn't keep up with anything [[06:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24497.4s)]
*  we were turning into zombies [[06:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24499.4s)]
*  we were starving to death [[06:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24501.4s)]
*  everybody was just so sickly losing so much weight [[06:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24503.4s)]
*  eating up with all kinds of rashes [[06:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24505.4s)]
*  and everything [[06:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24507.4s)]
*  you more or less started doing whatever you were told [[06:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24509.4s)]
*  he would do this ritual [[06:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24511.4s)]
*  thing every night [[06:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24513.4s)]
*  where he would like read a newspaper [[06:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24515.4s)]
*  or something and then make you memorize it [[06:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24517.4s)]
*  and then give everybody tests [[06:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24519.4s)]
*  and if you couldn't pass the test then it was back to the work [[06:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24521.4s)]
*  crew, the chain gang [[06:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24523.4s)]
*  I don't know how anybody could retain anything [[06:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24525.4s)]
*  I don't know how he kept it up [[06:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24527.4s)]
*  everybody in Jonestown [[06:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24529.4s)]
*  was really nice sweet people [[06:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24531.4s)]
*  they were really beautiful [[06:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24533.4s)]
*  people and they don't know how they ended up [[06:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24535.4s)]
*  in that [[06:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24537.4s)]
*  I went through a big head trip about it [[06:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24539.4s)]
*  because loving everybody so much, right? [[06:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24541.4s)]
*  to see how we were so badly abused [[06:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24543.4s)]
*  you didn't even realize you were being abused [[06:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24545.4s)]
*  while it was happening to you [[06:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24547.4s)]
*  or I should say while we all [[06:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24549.4s)]
*  participated in it because we all did [[06:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24551.4s)]
*  I took turns going up there and [[06:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24553.4s)]
*  beating people up too [[06:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24555.4s)]
*  people took turns beating me up [[06:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24557.4s)]
*  it wasn't anything personal [[06:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24559.4s)]
*  we all participated in it, every last one of us [[06:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24561.4s)]
*  that's why none of us [[06:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24563.4s)]
*  are any more guilty than anybody else [[06:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24565.4s)]
*  and a lot of that is hard to live with [[06:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24567.4s)]
*  but you just got to accept it [[06:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24569.4s)]
*  end quote [[06:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24571.4s)]
*  I was going to play the audio [[06:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24573.4s)]
*  of this for you but I think you kind of [[06:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24575.4s)]
*  get the picture by now [[06:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24577.4s)]
*  the two boys were brought up in front of the whole [[06:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24579.4s)]
*  community, screamed on [[06:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24581.4s)]
*  abused, beaten down, physically beaten [[06:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24583.4s)]
*  for like an hour [[06:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24587.4s)]
*  it just went on and on, you're talking about [[06:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24589.4s)]
*  800, 700, 800, 900 [[06:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24591.4s)]
*  people assembled just beating down [[06:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24593.4s)]
*  these two teenagers [[06:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24595.4s)]
*  screaming on them, afterward [[06:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24597.4s)]
*  the two of them were putting leg irons [[06:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24599.4s)]
*  attached to heavy weights like a ball [[06:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24601.4s)]
*  and chain kind of thing which they had to drag [[06:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24603.4s)]
*  around or carry around the camp for weeks [[06:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24605.4s)]
*  while they served out [[06:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24607.4s)]
*  a sentence of hard labor [[06:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24609.4s)]
*  one time [[06:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24611.4s)]
*  an old black man [[06:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24613.4s)]
*  you can, I don't [[06:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24615.4s)]
*  know the guy's age specifically [[06:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24617.4s)]
*  but you can just hear it in the audio [[06:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24619.4s)]
*  this is an old man [[06:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24621.4s)]
*  sounds like he's in his 70s or 80s [[06:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24623.4s)]
*  he hadn't heard from any of his [[06:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24625.4s)]
*  relatives back in the United States for a long [[06:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24627.4s)]
*  time and so he asked [[06:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24629.4s)]
*  a woman who was being [[06:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24631.4s)]
*  sent back to the United States [[06:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24633.4s)]
*  on an assignment from Jim to bring [[06:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24635.4s)]
*  his people a message, just [[06:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24637.4s)]
*  asking maybe why he hadn't heard from [[06:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24639.4s)]
*  him, send me a letter, I'm doing fine [[06:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24641.4s)]
*  well they were at a nightly [[06:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24643.4s)]
*  meeting and she ratted him out publicly [[06:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24645.4s)]
*  and it was the same deal [[06:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24647.4s)]
*  I mean this is, like I said, this is an old man [[06:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24649.4s)]
*  and they are just [[06:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24651.4s)]
*  going off on this guy and he's kind of [[06:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24653.4s)]
*  stuttering his way through trying to explain [[06:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24655.4s)]
*  that he didn't mean anything by it, he just [[06:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24657.4s)]
*  wanted them to know that he was [[06:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24659.4s)]
*  doing alright, he just missed his family [[06:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24661.4s)]
*  and the community is just abusing [[06:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24663.4s)]
*  this guy into submission [[06:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24665.4s)]
*  and not just Jim, I mean [[06:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24667.4s)]
*  people are just taking turns on [[06:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24669.4s)]
*  this guy and it goes on [[06:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24671.4s)]
*  for a long time [[06:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24673.4s)]
*  the audio quality [[06:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24675.4s)]
*  for this clip isn't great [[06:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24677.4s)]
*  and I'm not so good at cleaning it up [[06:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24679.4s)]
*  anyway, like I said, I think you just [[06:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24681.4s)]
*  get the picture by now [[06:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24683.4s)]
*  so I'm not going to play it but [[06:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24685.4s)]
*  the thing to really [[06:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24687.4s)]
*  know about it is that it was not unique [[06:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24689.4s)]
*  I mean this is the kind of thing that was going on [[06:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24691.4s)]
*  every night all the time now [[06:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24693.4s)]
*  Now I mentioned that Jim's wife [[06:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24695.4s)]
*  Marceline had been in San Francisco [[06:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24697.4s)]
*  managing the Temple headquarters there [[06:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24699.4s)]
*  and trying to defend her husband [[06:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24701.4s)]
*  in court and to the press [[06:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24703.4s)]
*  to the extent possible [[06:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24705.4s)]
*  as she was fielding increasingly [[06:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24707.4s)]
*  hysterical calls [[06:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24709.4s)]
*  from the radio in Jonestown [[06:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24711.4s)]
*  and she held up as well as she could [[06:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24713.4s)]
*  as reporters were peppering her with questions [[06:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24715.4s)]
*  about Jim's affairs with dozens of men and women [[06:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24717.4s)]
*  and she played the good soldier [[06:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24719.4s)]
*  defending Jim's rights over a son [[06:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24721.4s)]
*  that had resulted from his adultery with another woman [[06:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24723.4s)]
*  Jim had one of his mistresses [[06:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24727.4s)]
*  back in San Francisco watching Marceline [[06:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24729.4s)]
*  and providing regular reports [[06:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24731.4s)]
*  and one of them she said, [[06:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24733.4s)]
*  Marcy is okay except between 8 to 10 in the morning [[06:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24735.4s)]
*  and then it is tears [[06:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24737.4s)]
*  and all the old tunes that you've heard before [[06:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24739.4s)]
*  about how she has to take a back seat in your life [[06:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24741.4s)]
*  only a wife in name [[06:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24743.4s)]
*  for 12 years now [[06:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24745.4s)]
*  and how she's had to sacrifice all for the cause [[06:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24747.4s)]
*  she took estrogen today [[06:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24749.4s)]
*  so hopefully her moods will improve [[06:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24751.4s)]
*  around this time Marceline returns to Jonestown [[06:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24755.4s)]
*  and she gets there to find Jim [[06:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24757.4s)]
*  living with his two mistresses [[06:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24759.4s)]
*  Carolyn and Maria [[06:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24761.4s)]
*  along with Kimo, his son by Carolyn [[06:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24763.4s)]
*  and John Victor who is now under the care of Maria [[06:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24765.4s)]
*  and told that Grace, his birth mother [[06:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24767.4s)]
*  is dead [[06:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24769.4s)]
*  Marceline is given a separate cottage [[06:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24771.4s)]
*  Jim stays with those two women [[06:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24773.4s)]
*  so she just eats that humiliation [[06:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24775.4s)]
*  even Carolyn by this point [[06:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24777.4s)]
*  Jim was so broken down that [[06:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24779.4s)]
*  she had become more of a caretaker [[06:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24781.4s)]
*  than a lover [[06:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24783.4s)]
*  and she also took on [[06:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24785.4s)]
*  more and more of the day to day responsibilities [[06:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24787.4s)]
*  of running Jonestown [[06:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24789.4s)]
*  as Jim was falling apart from drug abuse [[06:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24791.4s)]
*  and psychosis [[06:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24793.4s)]
*  Maria had become his primary mistress [[06:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24795.4s)]
*  but like the others before her [[06:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24797.4s)]
*  she had to endure watching Jim [[06:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24799.4s)]
*  take others randomly into his bed [[06:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24801.4s)]
*  whenever he felt the urge and had the energy [[06:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24803.4s)]
*  secretly Marceline is taken to the [[06:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24805.4s)]
*  secretly Marceline [[06:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24807.4s)]
*  began moving money into foreign bank accounts [[06:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24809.4s)]
*  in the names of her sons [[06:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24811.4s)]
*  so that they might have [[06:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24813.4s)]
*  something set aside if the walls [[06:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24815.4s)]
*  ever closed in completely [[06:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24817.4s)]
*  Marceline knew Jim better than anybody else [[06:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24819.4s)]
*  and she saw [[06:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24821.4s)]
*  when she got there [[06:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24823.4s)]
*  how completely his mind had fallen apart [[06:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24825.4s)]
*  at some point [[06:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24827.4s)]
*  evidence of what she was doing was discovered [[06:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24829.4s)]
*  and brought to Jim but he didn't do anything [[06:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24831.4s)]
*  Marceline still carried a lot of weight [[06:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24833.4s)]
*  carried a lot of weight and [[06:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24835.4s)]
*  that weight [[06:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24837.4s)]
*  especially with the original Indiana members [[06:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24839.4s)]
*  and those original members themselves carried [[06:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24841.4s)]
*  a lot of weight in Jonestown and it was a fight Jim didn't need [[06:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24843.4s)]
*  but he [[06:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24845.4s)]
*  he didn't trust her [[06:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24847.4s)]
*  he didn't trust anybody completely [[06:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24849.4s)]
*  anymore except for Carolyn [[06:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24851.4s)]
*  and Maria [[06:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24853.4s)]
*  and his mother who I haven't talked about [[06:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24855.4s)]
*  really but she's been here the whole time [[06:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24857.4s)]
*  in all the biography [[06:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24859.4s)]
*  she's always a very very background character [[06:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24861.4s)]
*  but she's a very important person in Jim's life [[06:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24863.4s)]
*  she has been there the entire time [[06:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24865.4s)]
*  she's been in Jonestown the entire time [[06:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24867.4s)]
*  until December 9th, 1977 [[06:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24873.4s)]
*  when she died of a heart attack [[06:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24875.4s)]
*  and with Marceline alienated [[06:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24877.4s)]
*  Jim really lost [[06:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24879.4s)]
*  with the death of his mother [[06:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24881.4s)]
*  the last firm connection he had [[06:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24883.4s)]
*  back to the days before he was God [[06:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24885.4s)]
*  his mother was buried near the settlement [[06:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24887.4s)]
*  and Jim retreated to his cottage [[06:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24889.4s)]
*  and disappeared for days [[06:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24891.4s)]
*  in and out of a drug induced stupor [[06:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24893.4s)]
*  the people [[06:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24895.4s)]
*  may have been happy for the break from the all night meetings [[06:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24897.4s)]
*  and having to listen to him all day [[06:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24899.4s)]
*  on the camp PA system [[06:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24901.4s)]
*  but members of his staff were fretting [[06:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24903.4s)]
*  and they tended to him [[06:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24905.4s)]
*  people were wondering what's going to happen [[06:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24907.4s)]
*  and Jim was very upset [[06:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24909.4s)]
*  and he was very upset [[06:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24911.4s)]
*  and Jim was very upset [[06:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24913.4s)]
*  and people were wondering what's going to happen [[06:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24915.4s)]
*  and so people started writing him letters [[06:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24917.4s)]
*  and so people started writing him letters [[06:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24919.4s)]
*  some of those letters were [[06:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24923.4s)]
*  filled with suggestions [[06:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24925.4s)]
*  about what they should do [[06:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24927.4s)]
*  if their situation became dire [[06:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24929.4s)]
*  and one of those was from a close member [[06:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24931.4s)]
*  of the inner circle named Phyllis Chaikin [[06:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24933.4s)]
*  and it went like this [[06:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24935.4s)]
*  quote, Dad, [[06:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24937.4s)]
*  last night I wrestled with views presented [[06:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24939.4s)]
*  at the meeting [[06:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24941.4s)]
*  coming back to the idea that revolutionary suicide [[06:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24943.4s)]
*  is the only solution we have [[06:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24945.4s)]
*  if the young men in the [[06:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24947.4s)]
*  GDF, Guyanese Defense Force [[06:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24949.4s)]
*  fight because they are told or believe [[06:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24951.4s)]
*  we are a threat to their nation's economic [[06:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24953.4s)]
*  and political survival [[06:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24955.4s)]
*  their suppliers will give them unlimited [[06:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24957.4s)]
*  directions and supplies because they are fascists [[06:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24959.4s)]
*  I don't see we will [[06:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24961.4s)]
*  survive continuous skirmishes [[06:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24963.4s)]
*  with the continually dwindling force and arsenal [[06:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24965.4s)]
*  I see bravado behind [[06:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24967.4s)]
*  many that are for fighting [[06:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24969.4s)]
*  but if we carried on hard enough we could protect [[06:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24971.4s)]
*  you and the integrity of the group [[06:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24973.4s)]
*  I disagree [[06:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24975.4s)]
*  either choice, the leader, the group [[06:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24977.4s)]
*  would not survive [[06:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24979.4s)]
*  our enemies' power and resources are astronomical [[06:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24981.4s)]
*  our powers are limited [[06:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24983.4s)]
*  the thing that disturbs me most [[06:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24985.4s)]
*  about fighting a war is lack of [[06:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24987.4s)]
*  control of the consequences [[06:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24989.4s)]
*  the very people who resist [[06:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24991.4s)]
*  revolutionary suicide because they want to save [[06:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24993.4s)]
*  their asses would make excellent captives [[06:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24995.4s)]
*  for the enemy, saying anything they need [[06:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24997.4s)]
*  to under the illusion that they would be protected [[06:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=24999.4s)]
*  many of us would have to be [[06:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25001.4s)]
*  tortured but I worry we would break down [[06:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25003.4s)]
*  we are not familiar with [[06:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25005.4s)]
*  the life of physical suffering as the brave [[06:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25007.4s)]
*  peasants of China, Vietnam, and Russia [[06:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25009.4s)]
*  ultimately I only [[06:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25011.4s)]
*  trust you [[06:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25013.4s)]
*  the enemy is clever and that [[06:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25015.4s)]
*  which would be fetched from our mouths would be calculated [[06:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25017.4s)]
*  to harm the worldwide struggle of brave [[06:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25019.4s)]
*  people [[06:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25021.4s)]
*  we in a fighting war would not [[06:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25023.4s)]
*  have control of which of us and how [[06:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25025.4s)]
*  many of us would be taken in as captives [[06:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25027.4s)]
*  though the strongest might kill [[06:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25029.4s)]
*  themselves before being taken, the weakest [[06:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25031.4s)]
*  no matter what they might say [[06:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25033.4s)]
*  in public meetings would not kill themselves [[06:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25035.4s)]
*  and would be the first to talk [[06:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25037.4s)]
*  then there is the problem of paralyzed [[06:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25039.4s)]
*  and maimed survivors [[06:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25041.4s)]
*  if we don't have a solution to being sure [[06:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25043.4s)]
*  we are not leaving half alive children [[06:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25045.4s)]
*  when the enemy is not breathing on our back [[06:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25047.4s)]
*  we surely run more of a risk [[06:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25049.4s)]
*  when the enemy is [[06:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25051.4s)]
*  my proposal is the following [[06:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25053.4s)]
*  as it appears we will have to take [[06:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25055.4s)]
*  the ultimate step, we prepare [[06:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25057.4s)]
*  the people by reading the words [[06:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25059.4s)]
*  of strong assertive revolutionaries of the [[06:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25061.4s)]
*  past who took this choice over the PA [[06:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25063.4s)]
*  systems, one aspect [[06:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25065.4s)]
*  of the resistance is its unfamiliarity [[06:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25067.4s)]
*  particularly with leaders who [[06:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25069.4s)]
*  people look up to [[06:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25071.4s)]
*  there should also be discussion of this tactic [[06:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25073.4s)]
*  in the school and socialist classes [[06:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25075.4s)]
*  when the time comes that all [[06:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25077.4s)]
*  of our alternatives have been used up [[06:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25079.4s)]
*  we will meet as a group in the pavilion [[06:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25081.4s)]
*  surrounded with highly trusted security [[06:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25083.4s)]
*  with guns [[06:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25085.4s)]
*  names will be called off randomly [[06:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25087.4s)]
*  people will be escorted to a place of [[06:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25089.4s)]
*  dying by a strong personality [[06:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25091.4s)]
*  Joyce Toucet, Jan Wolsey, [[06:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25093.4s)]
*  Sharon Amis, Carolyn Layton, [[06:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25095.4s)]
*  Maria Katsaris, Paula Adams come to my mind [[06:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25097.4s)]
*  who are loving, supportive [[06:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25099.4s)]
*  but not sympathetic [[06:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25101.4s)]
*  they, the victim slash [[06:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25103.4s)]
*  escort, are accompanied by [[06:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25105.4s)]
*  two strong security men with guns [[06:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25107.4s)]
*  I don't trust people to [[06:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25109.4s)]
*  arrange their own death any more than I trust [[06:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25111.4s)]
*  someone to put himself on learning crew [[06:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25113.4s)]
*  for two weeks, but both can be arranged [[06:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25115.4s)]
*  by outside pressure and no alternatives [[06:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25117.4s)]
*  left open [[06:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25119.4s)]
*  at the place of dying they are shot in the head [[06:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25121.4s)]
*  and if Larry Shock does not believe [[06:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25123.4s)]
*  they are definitely dead their throat is [[06:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25125.4s)]
*  slit with a scalpel [[06:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25127.4s)]
*  I would be willing to help here if it's necessary [[06:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25129.4s)]
*  the bodies would be thrown in a ditch [[06:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25131.4s)]
*  it might be advisable [[06:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25133.4s)]
*  to blindfold the people [[06:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25135.4s)]
*  before going to the death place [[06:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25137.4s)]
*  in that the blood and bodies remaining on the ground [[06:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25139.4s)]
*  might increase their agitation [[06:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25141.4s)]
*  the idea sickens me [[06:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25143.4s)]
*  when I've been on the line in the [[06:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25145.4s)]
*  past and thought I would be fighting [[06:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25147.4s)]
*  I felt exhilarated [[06:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25149.4s)]
*  though I am nothing great with a cutlass [[06:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25151.4s)]
*  I knew I could do something to divert the enemy [[06:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25153.4s)]
*  or add some jobs or give medical help [[06:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25155.4s)]
*  to a fellow fighter [[06:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25157.4s)]
*  actively hit the enemy one way or another [[06:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25159.4s)]
*  there is nothing exhilarating about this [[06:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25161.4s)]
*  plan, it is horrible [[06:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25163.4s)]
*  but it is safe [[06:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25165.4s)]
*  and it is a skillless [[06:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25167.4s)]
*  end quote [[06:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25169.4s)]
*  when Jim finally emerged one evening [[06:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25171.4s)]

*  will and determination [[06:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25183.4s)]

*  then Jim said he had an important announcement to make [[07:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25289.4s)]
*  he said that [[07:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25291.4s)]
*  moves had been made [[07:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25293.4s)]
*  and pieces were being put in place [[07:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25295.4s)]
*  to relocate the entire settlement to the Soviet Union [[07:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25297.4s)]
*  he said that [[07:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25299.4s)]
*  he said that Guyana was such a small country [[07:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25301.4s)]
*  that over time it was unlikely [[07:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25303.4s)]
*  that they were going to be able to stand up to the overwhelming power [[07:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25305.4s)]
*  of the conspiracy against them in the US [[07:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25307.4s)]

*  and that they would have to use what time they had to prepare an escape [[07:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25311.4s)]
*  and then suddenly he collapsed on stage [[07:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25313.4s)]
*  one of his old tricks [[07:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25315.4s)]

*  you know he's done this so many times in front of these people [[07:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25321.4s)]
*  I don't know how it continued to have its desired effect [[07:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25323.4s)]
*  I don't know how it continued to have its desired effect [[07:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25325.4s)]
*  but it did [[07:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25327.4s)]
*  and then he's in a state of shock [[07:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25329.4s)]

*  and history were going to be stepped up [[07:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25375.4s)]
*  because they had to prepare for this trip now [[07:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25377.4s)]
*  and when [[07:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25379.4s)]
*  and when the time came to prove [[07:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25381.4s)]
*  that they were committed and ready [[07:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25383.4s)]
*  always coming. It might come before they were prepared. And if that happened, then it was [[07:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25385.4s)]
*  unfortunate but some people were going to have to stay behind and fight while the others [[07:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25389.68s)]
*  made their escape. Just a few months after moving to the promised land now, the people [[07:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25393.36s)]
*  are now being told to prepare to abandon it. From that point on, it was an accepted fact [[07:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25400.2s)]
*  that they would be leaving. They were going to Russia. It was just a matter of when and [[07:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25405.5s)]
*  word might come down at any time that they were evacuating immediately. So they had to [[07:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25409.280000000002s)]
*  be ready. Keep a bag packed. After the meeting, Jim held back the Jonestown doctor who had [[07:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25413.68s)]
*  tended to him and asked him to ponder a question which the doctor answered in a note back to [[07:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25419.6s)]
*  him. He said, There is a good chance I can develop germicidal means. I am quite capable [[07:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25425.36s)]
*  of organizing the suicidal aspect. Plus, we'll follow through. Plus, try to convey concern. [[07:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25433.48s)]
*  Warmth throughout the ordeal. From that point on, white nights were called periodically every few [[07:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25439.72s)]
*  weeks. After a nighttime meeting, people would finally retire exhausted to bed. And when they'd [[07:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25447.760000000002s)]
*  been given just enough time to get to sleep, Jim would come blaring over the loudspeaker alert, [[07:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25455.960000000003s)]
*  alert, we're under attack, white night, white night. And the people would grab their weapons [[07:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25460.4s)]
*  and rush out to their assigned defensive positions, you know, wavering with exhaustion and screaming in [[07:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25465.6s)]
*  unison at some imaginary enemy out in the jungle. And just imagine the scene. It's just a lot of [[07:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25469.84s)]
*  this story is so wild that you have to stop again. And just remember that all of this happened. It [[07:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25480.039999999997s)]
*  all happened. These are all real people. Just imagine flying over it in an airplane. And there's [[07:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25486.0s)]
*  just an ocean. It's 2am. There's an ocean of jungle in every direction. And then down below, [[07:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25491.72s)]
*  there's just a little patch cleared, lit up by torches and floodlights with 1000 Americans, [[07:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25498.32s)]
*  old people, kids, most of them old people and kids, some of them rushed out to the tree line [[07:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25505.0s)]
*  in their underwear, waving meat cleavers and cutlasses and shovels over their heads and [[07:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25512.32s)]
*  screaming at the top of their lungs at some imaginary enemy out in the jungle. And they're [[07:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25518.28s)]
*  not just playacting. You know, we're talking about a group of people whose sense of reality [[07:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25523.0s)]
*  had been so twisted that they think this is real. Even Jim Jones and his staff, who knew about the [[07:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25528.399999999998s)]
*  staged attacks and knew that black people weren't being rounded up into concentration camps back in [[07:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25534.32s)]
*  America. They thought of those things as little white lies necessary to keep the people focused [[07:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25538.719999999998s)]
*  and prepared for the threats that they really did face. And you just think, okay, how did we get [[07:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25545.0s)]
*  here? You know, just retrace all the steps that led a preacher from a small town in Indiana to this [[07:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25552.12s)]
*  place. And the answers have a lot to do with how an honors grad from Berkeley from a middle class [[07:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25558.72s)]
*  family ended up sending bombs to Diane Feinstein's house with her weed dealer boyfriend who eventually [[07:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25567.36s)]
*  split her skull and drove up the PCH with a bag of her brains. And how a pharmacist daughter and a [[07:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25573.76s)]
*  bunch of other white activists ended up following a mentally ill black convict into a suicidal [[07:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25579.48s)]
*  shootout with the LAPD. Ask these people why they were doing what they were doing. And they would [[07:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25584.8s)]
*  all give very similar answers. They would cite the same influences, they would tell you about the same [[07:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25591.719999999998s)]
*  books, they would repeat the same slogans. At this white night, people show up, they're ready to fight, [[07:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25597.0s)]
*  they got their weapons. And at first, it's no different from others. It's become routine almost. [[07:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25605.6s)]
*  Guyanese soldiers have been spotted nearby, attack is imminent, everybody's called to the pavilion to [[07:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25610.32s)]
*  discuss strategy. Someone suggested fleeing to Russia, but Jim says things aren't in place for that [[07:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25615.52s)]
*  yet. And so they debate what to do through the early morning hours until the sun comes up. Jim's [[07:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25622.52s)]
*  leaving from time to time to get reports from the radio room. And finally, he comes back after one [[07:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25628.64s)]
*  trip with the grim news that the military, the Guyanese military is on its way. The very existence [[07:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25633.920000000002s)]
*  of their socialist community was proving to the world that such a thing was possible. And it was [[07:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25642.48s)]
*  actually stirring up revolutionary movements in the United States and other parts of the world. And [[07:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25648.64s)]
*  so the powers that be had made the decision that this had to end right now. And the military was [[07:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25654.8s)]
*  coming to exterminate every man, woman and child in Jonestown. The number of troops on the way was [[07:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25660.96s)]
*  overwhelming, there was no escape. And so rather than wait for an ugly death at the hands of their [[07:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25667.32s)]
*  enemies, the only way to maintain their dignity and make sure that their children weren't carried [[07:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25673.32s)]
*  off as captives was to embrace Huey Newton's call for revolutionary suicide and go out on their own [[07:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25678.4s)]
*  terms. Nobody argued. And many spoke up with enthusiasm for the heroic revolutionary gesture. [[07:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25684.08s)]
*  And vats of liquid were brought out and everyone was told to line up. And they filled their cups, [[07:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25693.0s)]
*  and they drank and they waited for the end which they were told would come in about 45 minutes. And [[07:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25698.800000000003s)]
*  as soon as everybody had taken their turn, Jim informed them that this had just been a test and [[07:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25704.0s)]
*  that they had all passed. And he congratulated them and they congratulated each other for their [[07:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25709.84s)]
*  revolutionary spirit. And Jim gave them all the day off work. And the exhausted crowd of people [[07:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25714.8s)]
*  stumbled back to their bunks and went to sleep. And now Jim Jones knew that he had a plan that would [[07:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25722.8s)]
*  work. The doctor was instructed right then to put in an order for one pound of sodium cyanide enough [[07:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25729.96s)]
*  to kill nearly 2000 adults. At the next night meeting, writing materials were passed out and [[07:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25737.92s)]
*  the people were told to write essays on the topic. What I would do if this were the last white night. [[07:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25747.36s)]
*  One woman wrote, I will do anything to keep one person free from the imperialist. I will use my [[07:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25754.12s)]
*  life fighting for the freedom of all people. And another wrote, I don't mind dying. I want to fight [[07:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25760.36s)]
*  for this land and also die for it. I sure don't want to die alone. I want to take some of the [[07:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25767.44s)]
*  traitors with me as many as possible. Tie a bomb on me and let me walk or run into them. Or [[07:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25772.239999999998s)]
*  revolutionary suicide. A young girl, Gail Chagin wrote, I am willing to do any mission, including [[07:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25778.64s)]
*  killing any traitor or myself. Grace Stone said that I was the favorite person she used to take [[07:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25788.280000000002s)]
*  care of. I would like to personally kill her. I could attach myself to a bomb, burn myself in front [[07:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25793.96s)]
*  of the US embassy, or tell them that I wanted to destroy the church and ask for a meeting of all [[07:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25800.4s)]
*  those who have left the church, then kill them. And another older woman wrote, age is against me. I [[07:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25805.48s)]
*  know I could do more if I was younger. I have considered what I could do back in the States or [[07:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25813.239999999998s)]
*  in another country. It would be easy to set up a big banquet of the most important officials, then [[07:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25818.079999999998s)]
*  kill them all. I would find a poison that would be immediate but tasteless. I would use this on the [[07:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25823.48s)]
*  mass of them. In the process, I would kill myself because I would eat it too. Then no one could trace [[07:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25828.92s)]
*  who or what or why no one would ever know. But the socialists would be left in a position to move in. [[07:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25835.0s)]
*  Should I perhaps establish connections, they might perchance know that I was a socialist and block me. [[07:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25841.52s)]
*  This would satisfy me just knowing that my children were fighting hard in the cause. If I am [[07:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25847.36s)]
*  imprisoned, I would hold out as long as I could. And then I would dig into my jugular vein or at the [[07:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25852.36s)]
*  side of the neck where you bleed to death in two minutes. I would see that I had plenty of time to [[07:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25857.68s)]
*  accomplish this so that I would not be stopped before I started it. I would prefer taking a batch [[07:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25862.16s)]
*  out with me. I have also considered being a walking bomb. And a mother wrote, I will take orders if [[07:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25867.2s)]
*  necessary and do anything in my power to get all babies aside, then lay my life down to fight until [[07:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25874.72s)]
*  the end, kill myself if it takes place so as not to be left for the fascists. I will leave no one [[07:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25880.48s)]
*  else either. I will kill them off if they are not dead already. There are hundreds and hundreds of [[07:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25886.420000000002s)]
*  these from little children, from old ladies. Everybody wrote them. The nightly meetings became [[07:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25893.18s)]
*  consumed with fantasies of violence and revenge against the traitors. Children were encouraged to [[07:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25905.100000000002s)]
*  describe to the group what they like to do to their own relatives back home. [[07:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25911.86s)]
*  I'm sure one of you have a [[07:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=25941.86s)]
*  good time. [[07:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26061.82s)]
*  By this time, it's becoming clear to everybody in the inner circle that enemies are no enemies. [[07:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26064.78s)]
*  Jonestown is a failing experiment. Several of the most knowledgeable insiders were assigned to run [[07:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26071.94s)]
*  the numbers and provide a report on the settlement's prospects. And they came back saying that there's [[07:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26078.5s)]
*  no way Jonestown is ever going to be self-sustaining. It's just a matter of holding out until the money [[07:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26084.18s)]
*  runs dry and then... Every day, new unexpected costs rolled in. $44,000 for a new tractor, [[07:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26091.62s)]
*  $22,000 for aluminum to patch roofs, $16,000 to replace ruined livestock feed, the constant expense [[07:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26100.579999999998s)]
*  of Charles Gehry's legal retainer, which was high and never seemed to get anywhere. And the [[07:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26108.86s)]
*  concerned relatives knew that and they planned to keep the legal pressure on to keep the expenses [[07:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26115.02s)]
*  high. There were only about 300 Temple members total back in America. There's almost no money [[07:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26119.58s)]
*  coming in from the United States. There were millions of dollars in Temple accounts, but they [[07:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26127.02s)]
*  were draining money at a rate of over a hundred grand a month, even when things were at their [[07:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26132.34s)]
*  best. And so it was just a matter of time. Maybe they could last a few years, but the walls were [[07:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26137.300000000003s)]
*  closing in and Jim did not see a way out. He had visions of the Temple declaring bankruptcy and his [[07:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26146.06s)]
*  people sulking back to the United States in shame for having followed an idiot like him there. [[07:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26153.780000000002s)]
*  Himself a subject of scorn and mockery in the media while he does his time in jail. He imagined [[07:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26158.9s)]
*  his son living with Grace and Tim Stone, learning from them what an evil man his father was and what [[07:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26167.54s)]
*  a joke he was. He told his people that he had terminal lung cancer and not much longer to live. [[07:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26175.46s)]
*  There's no evidence that that's true. He complained of having strokes and heart attacks all the time. [[07:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26182.899999999998s)]
*  He did constantly suffer from migraines. He was terribly depressed and irritable all the time and [[07:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26188.739999999998s)]
*  basically only kept out of bed by inhuman doses of methamphetamines and put to sleep only by other [[07:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26197.14s)]
*  drugs. A common acquaintance put Jim in touch with another lawyer back in the United States, [[07:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26204.3s)]
*  famous guy on the left named Mark Lane, who was a sort of 1970s left-wing Alex Jones kind of figure. [[07:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26212.1s)]
*  He'd written books with conspiracy theories about the Kennedy and MLK assassinations and he had [[07:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26221.54s)]
*  defended James Earl Ray, Dr. King's convicted assassin in court, claiming that the assassination [[07:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26227.38s)]
*  was actually an FBI hit. More than anything, he was a publicity hound always looking for a new way [[07:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26232.18s)]
*  to get his name in the papers and in that way he was very similar to Jim's other lawyer, Charles [[07:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26239.42s)]
*  Gary. Gary didn't want to share the limelight with this guy, Mark Lane, but Lane knew better [[07:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26243.579999999998s)]
*  than Gary how to talk to somebody like Jim Jones. He understood the paranoid mindset. Everything Jim [[07:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26249.86s)]
*  Jones said he agreed with. The CIA is after you? Totally, I agree. They've entered into a [[07:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26255.5s)]
*  conspiracy with your former members and relatives of current members? Yeah, right on. The boy, [[07:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26261.54s)]
*  John Victor's your son because you had sex with his mother because she demanded her or else she [[07:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26266.86s)]
*  would commit treason? Makes total sense. Again, he was a pretty famous guy on the left back then, [[07:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26270.7s)]
*  especially in the radical circles. Jim and his people would have found credible. Jim believed [[07:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26277.260000000002s)]
*  had read his books and believed his theories. The last thing that needed to happen at this point [[07:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26284.94s)]
*  was a guy like this showing up and telling Jim he was right about everything. And he made it even [[07:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26292.66s)]
*  worse. Mark Lane tracked down the private investigator who had previously been hired by the concerned [[07:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26299.539999999997s)]
*  relatives to look into Jim's contacts in Guyana and see about getting John Victor back and he flies [[07:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26305.82s)]
*  this private investigator out to Guyana to talk to Jim. Charles Gary, for all his faults, is begging [[07:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26311.66s)]
*  Jim, cut this guy loose. Do not listen to this guy. But he flies this private investigator out [[07:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26319.3s)]
*  there to talk to Jim and he tells Jim and the staff that Tim Stone is financed by the CIA and [[07:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26323.98s)]
*  that the concerned relatives' efforts against the temple are all part of a CIA operation. He says [[07:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26331.66s)]
*  that Jim had been right about an imminent attack during the six-day siege the first white night. [[07:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26338.74s)]
*  He said that he, this guy's name was Joseph Mazur, at that time had been leading a team of [[07:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26345.34s)]
*  armed mercenaries to the edge of the settlement, that they really were there the whole time, to [[07:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26351.18s)]
*  kidnap Jonestown children on behalf of the concerned relatives. I don't know much about [[07:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26356.38s)]
*  this guy and I can't find out. I have tried. The books about Jonestown just say, you know, [[07:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26362.02s)]
*  well, what a crazy guy. He must have been full of it stringing Jim along to get money out of him [[07:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26369.14s)]
*  and you know, who knows that may be true. If it is, that is dark. I mean, you could probably say [[07:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26374.5s)]
*  that no single person outside of the temple community and its ex-members did more to create [[07:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26381.06s)]
*  the conditions for the mass suicide of Jonestown than this guy. And if he was just making all this [[07:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26388.5s)]
*  up, it is very dark. Because you can imagine the effect that it had on Jim Jones and his people. [[07:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26393.14s)]
*  You're like, oh my God, it's all true. Because even Jim probably had doubts at times. Psychosis and [[07:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26400.379999999997s)]
*  paranoia are funny like that. People with delusions sometimes have intimations that it's all a delusion. [[07:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26409.42s)]
*  But there's a part of them that says, whoa, whoa, whoa, back away from that realization. [[07:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26418.26s)]
*  Because if you admit that to yourself, then you got real problems and you got to deal with the [[07:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26421.86s)]
*  situation you've put yourself in and all the things you've done as a result of your being [[07:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26426.739999999998s)]
*  delusional. And it's much easier in some ways to just ignore that voice and keep the game going. [[07:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26432.1s)]
*  You know, you read accounts of people with paranoid delusions and you see this again and again, [[07:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26438.98s)]
*  even people with extreme psychosis, you can sometimes find nurses and orderlies in psychiatric [[07:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26444.739999999998s)]
*  hospitals, people who are experienced and have learned how to work with these people [[07:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26452.02s)]
*  and know how to deal with them. Sometimes they are able to get through to them just by kind of [[07:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26457.46s)]
*  winking at them a little bit and letting them know that they see through the game. [[07:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26463.219999999998s)]
*  Like, okay, okay, very funny. I get it. You're crazy. I see what you're doing. But [[07:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26466.899999999998s)]
*  come on, we got somewhere to be. Let's go. Let's go. And that'll work sometimes. [[07:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26471.140000000003s)]
*  You'll hear hospital workers talk about these occasional moments where the patient and them [[07:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26475.940000000002s)]
*  have this moment like, yeah, okay, okay. Delusions are not always as cut and dry as [[07:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26480.980000000003s)]
*  they're played out in movies. And sometimes moments of clarity or doubt break through, [[07:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26487.940000000002s)]
*  if only for a few moments before you're sucked back in. But then for somebody like Jim Jones, [[07:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26493.780000000002s)]
*  in a situation he's in to have a famous lawyer bring him a private investigator who for sure had [[07:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26499.86s)]
*  been hired by his enemies. That's definitely true. Who tells him flat out that everything he's been [[07:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26506.260000000002s)]
*  paranoid about is true. It's always been true. He was right all along. And these people are trying [[07:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26513.300000000003s)]
*  to kill you. And then they have tried. And I know because I led the group of mercenaries. [[07:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26519.7s)]
*  You know, if he was just making that up review box, that is dark. I mean, it's not as dark as [[07:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26524.899999999998s)]
*  the other possibility that he was telling the truth. That's so dark that none of the accounts [[07:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26530.82s)]
*  of Jonestown even go near it. I don't know of anyone who's even tracked this guy down [[07:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26537.379999999997s)]
*  and interviewed him. And so I hate to do this to you guys, but I just don't have any more [[07:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26542.42s)]
*  information on this part. The best I've got is that Mark Lane, the lawyer, knew that Jim [[07:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26546.579999999998s)]
*  Jones was a meal ticket, you know, a desperate paranoid with millions of dollars and potentially [[07:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26552.100000000002s)]
*  a story that would make a good book. And Lane had this private eye feeding Jim what he wanted [[07:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26558.100000000002s)]
*  to hear to string him along. I'm not accusing the guy of doing that. It's what the biographers imply. [[07:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26562.74s)]
*  I just don't have anything else for you. [[07:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26569.7s)]
*  And so we're moving into the fall of 1978. Now we're getting close to the end. [[07:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26573.86s)]
*  Marceline's parents visited Jonestown briefly in October and her mother described Jim Jones [[07:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26577.620000000003s)]
*  as very near mental collapse. The final dominoes began to fall when the concerned relatives [[07:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26583.06s)]
*  finally got the attention of a US congressman named Leo Ryan. He seems to have been a decent [[07:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26589.54s)]
*  enough guy for a politician, you know, a media hound for sure. But you know, he's a politician. [[07:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26597.780000000002s)]
*  His publicity stunts were at least in the service of good causes. You know, one time he had himself [[07:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26603.86s)]
*  booked and checked into a California prison as an anonymous inmate for a while so that he could [[07:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26609.059999999998s)]
*  experience the conditions for himself, make his case for prison reform, that kind of thing. [[07:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26613.219999999998s)]
*  Kind of a gonzo politician. Again, good intentions to bring attention to an issue. But one of those [[07:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26618.579999999998s)]
*  intentions was making sure that his name was in the headline for the story about the issue he raised. [[07:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26624.739999999998s)]
*  That's how the concerned relatives sold the Jonestown issue to him and he bit. [[07:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26630.42s)]
*  He put in some inquiries with the State Department but got back the usual disclaimers that, [[07:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26636.42s)]
*  you know, they looked into it. They'd inspected Jonestown regularly. Jonestown wasn't breaking [[07:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26641.46s)]
*  any rules. And you know, the State Department, they really were sensitive about infringing on [[07:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26646.42s)]
*  religious liberty. The federal government got in a lot of trouble in the 70s for messing around [[07:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26651.699999999997s)]
*  with different groups and they just didn't want to do anything about it. And so they went to [[07:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26655.699999999997s)]
*  groups and they just didn't want to deal with it. And so Ryan told the concerned relatives that he [[07:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26659.54s)]
*  was going to go there himself to check on the status of their family members and to meet Jim [[07:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26665.06s)]
*  Jones and to see for himself what was going on. Mark Lane, the lawyer, informed Jim Jones of this [[07:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26669.3s)]
*  and told him that Ryan is probably part of the conspiracy. So Congressman Ryan sends word to [[07:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26677.06s)]
*  Jonestown that he's going to be coming in mid-November 1978. By this point, Jim's emissaries [[07:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26684.58s)]
*  have been bugging the Cuban and Soviet ambassadors about their request to relocate for months with [[07:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26691.86s)]
*  little movement. It doesn't look like it's going anywhere. They're kind of giving up hope on that. [[07:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26697.140000000003s)]
*  His contacts in the Guyanese government are tired of his incessant badgering and they're to the point [[07:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26701.86s)]
*  of throwing his people out of their offices or just not taking their phone calls anymore. [[07:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26706.820000000003s)]
*  Jim had his lawyers inform the congressman that he was not welcome at Jonestown and would not be [[07:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26711.14s)]
*  admitted if he did make the trip. Both of them told Jim that that was not the way to handle things. [[07:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26715.3s)]
*  They found out that Leo Ryan would be making the trip with some other people. He was bringing along [[07:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26722.579999999998s)]
*  several television and newspaper crews to document the whole trip. [[07:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26729.14s)]
*  And his lawyers told Jim that if he refused the congressman entry to Jonestown, [[07:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26734.02s)]
*  then Ryan was going to use the journalist to turn it into a big dramatic scene and then take that [[07:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26738.74s)]
*  back to the U.S. to show how he'd been denied entry while trying to check on the status of U.S. citizens [[07:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26742.9s)]
*  and grow the issue into something even bigger. And so they said, look, just let him in, [[07:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26748.100000000002s)]
*  let him take a look around and talk to some people and he'll see what the U.S. embassy's been seeing [[07:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26752.420000000002s)]
*  all along. Just prepare for the trip, prepare for the inspection, show him you got nothing to hide. [[07:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26757.22s)]
*  And then if that works, you can be done with this for once and for all. And then he's going to be [[07:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26761.54s)]
*  done with this for once and for all. If Ryan comes away satisfied and then, you know, other officials [[07:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26767.06s)]
*  are contacted by the concerned relatives to try to take action against Jonestown, [[07:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26775.38s)]
*  they'll talk to Ryan and Ryan will say, I didn't see anything and they probably won't waste their time. [[07:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26779.620000000003s)]
*  Jim wasn't sure. He didn't want to let anybody in. He was very wary of that, [[07:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26787.22s)]
*  but the people discussed what to do. They argued about whether to let them in, [[07:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26790.420000000002s)]
*  what to do if they were allowed in. Some people suggested lying in ambush and attacking the party [[07:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26796.26s)]
*  once they came, killing them all, burying them in the jungle and then committing suicide. [[07:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26802.1s)]
*  Some people pointed out and many were agreeing with them that it was becoming clear that nothing [[07:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26808.42s)]
*  was going to stop the congressman from coming in and doing this. He got in a congressional [[07:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26813.14s)]
*  committee to authorize the trip, meaning that this was now official U.S. government business. [[07:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26819.059999999998s)]
*  So the government of Guyana was not going to intervene. [[07:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26823.14s)]
*  Several gyms in our circle were now agreeing with the lawyers that you got to let this guy in. [[07:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26827.78s)]
*  Marceline said that, you know, even if a few people wanted to leave, [[07:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26832.34s)]
*  we just let them leave. Who cares? Just a few people. Even at this late date, as this is [[07:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26837.059999999998s)]
*  approaching, I don't actually think even Jim knew what he was going to do. He was starting to realize [[07:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26844.579999999998s)]
*  this was happening, but at night he would rage against his enemies. [[07:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26852.66s)]
*  Oh, [[07:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26913.14s)]
*  let them hear it in the night. [[07:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26929.94s)]
*  Oh, [[07:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26943.14s)]
*  let the night roll with it. [[07:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26961.54s)]
*  Oh, [[07:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26972.98s)]
*  Congressman Ryan arrived in Georgetown, Guyana on November 15th and made his way to the temple's [[07:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26989.06s)]
*  headquarters there in town. And they tried to give him the run around, but after a long trip and a [[07:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=26994.9s)]
*  frustrating day, he wasn't going to be put off. He was going to Jonestown and that was that. [[07:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27000.9s)]
*  Jim's worst fears of Ryan's intentions seem to be proven by the fact that one of the news crews that [[07:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27007.300000000003s)]
*  he brought along with them was from the National Enquirer. And worst of all, Jim found out that [[07:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27012.58s)]
*  several of the concerned relatives, including Tim and Graystone, had accompanied Ryan to Guyana [[07:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27018.5s)]
*  and were expecting to be allowed in to Jonestown. [[07:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27023.620000000003s)]
*  And again, you got to remember like very recently he has been told by the private investigator who [[07:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27026.98s)]
*  was hired by the concerned relatives that Tim Stone was CIA, that he had been hired to lead [[07:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27033.14s)]
*  mercenaries into the camp. Jim believed this. Okay, now these people are accompanying the [[07:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27038.1s)]
*  congressman on this trip. So he's thinking this is it. I mean, he's thinking that [[07:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27044.26s)]
*  these people are here to destroy him, if not kill him, if not kill everybody. [[07:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27051.7s)]
*  Jim closed himself off in his cottage and radioed to Georgetown that no, tell them they're not [[07:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27055.3s)]
*  coming. No, they're not allowed. They're not welcome. And so congressman Ryan takes a harder [[07:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27060.1s)]
*  line. He says that he doesn't see any religious pictures or any other paraphernalia on the walls [[07:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27064.42s)]
*  of the temple headquarters there in Georgetown. And so given their political activity, he thinks [[07:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27069.059999999998s)]
*  he's going to have to go back and really lean on the IRS about removing their tax exempt status. [[07:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27073.7s)]
*  And it'll probably actually be a good thing for the country. [[07:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27079.3s)]
*  And so who knows how much money they're going to owe in back taxes going back many, many, many years. [[07:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27082.5s)]
*  Or they can let him come. And so this gave Jim's lawyers the leverage that they needed to get him [[07:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27094.420000000002s)]
*  to budge a little bit from his position. But he stayed in his cottage and he was still very, [[07:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27100.02s)]
*  very reluctant to let anybody in. At the last minute, when he heard that congressman Ryan was [[07:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27105.38s)]
*  boarding a plane to come out, he sent several of his men to port Kaituma to the airstrip to cut [[07:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27111.94s)]
*  down a bunch of trees and scatter them all over the airstrip to render it inaccessible by air. [[07:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27116.98s)]
*  He hoped that this would at least force Ryan to land at another location further away, [[07:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27122.739999999998s)]
*  which would delay his arrival and shorten the duration of any visit. But when they got to the [[07:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27126.82s)]
*  airstrip, they found it occupied by a Guyanese military plane, which had broken down and was [[07:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27131.3s)]
*  getting repairs. And there were several soldiers around, so they couldn't do that. [[07:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27135.94s)]
*  Marceline was in Georgetown at the time and spoke to Jim via radio and they got into an argument. [[07:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27141.94s)]
*  He's being really obtuse about this visit and she is arguing with them, shouting at him, [[07:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27149.46s)]
*  taking him to task in a way that nobody who was listening in on that [[07:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27154.26s)]
*  on that discussion had ever heard anybody do. [[07:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27158.26s)]
*  She said, you have to take this guy in. And she's screaming at him that she's been holding this [[07:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27163.14s)]
*  whole operation together for a long time and he's destroying it and things like that. But Jim won't [[07:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27168.18s)]
*  change his position, but it didn't matter. Everybody else had changed it for him. The lawyers, his wife [[07:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27173.86s)]
*  and his staff were taking the decision out of his hands. Ryan and his company were going to be [[07:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27181.059999999998s)]
*  allowed in. A few of his staff had anticipated that this visit was inevitable for quite a while, [[07:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27185.219999999998s)]
*  and so they had begun getting things ready and getting the people ready. [[07:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27191.059999999998s)]
*  Ryan's plane touched down in Porcaituma on November 17th with 19 passengers. [[07:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27198.02s)]
*  There was the pilot, Congressman Ryan and his aide Jackie Spear, who today is a serving US [[07:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27203.62s)]
*  Congresswoman. The lawyers, Charles Gary and Mark Lane. There was an official from the US Embassy [[07:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27209.379999999997s)]
*  and one representing the government of Guyana. There were nine members of the media, including [[07:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27216.42s)]
*  NBC News reporter Don Harris. And then there were several concerned relatives, although [[07:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27221.78s)]
*  the Stones, Tim and Grace had the good sense to remain in Georgetown, having some idea of [[07:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27227.7s)]
*  what they might provoke from the temple if they showed up at the Jonestown gate. [[07:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27233.059999999998s)]
*  At first, Ryan and his aid alone were hauled into Jonestown and Marceline was the first person they [[07:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27238.5s)]
*  met. When they got there, they found the camp in immaculate shape. Everything was prepared. The [[07:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27246.02s)]
*  paths were swept. Everything was tidy. Some of the people looked at them warily, but most of the [[07:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27251.7s)]
*  people had been well prepared and they stuck to the script and they smiled. Marceline offered a [[07:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27259.620000000003s)]
*  tour of the camp, but Ryan had a long day and he demanded to speak with Jim Jones. [[07:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27266.34s)]
*  Jim emerged wearing his dark sunglasses, certainly less than 100%, but he held it together. [[07:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27271.78s)]
*  After talking with the congressmen, they came to an agreement that the press and the visitors in [[07:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27279.94s)]
*  Port Kaituma would be allowed in to Jonestown, with the exception of the National Enquirer people [[07:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27284.42s)]
*  he didn't want them in. And so the tractor was sent back to retrieve them while congressmen, [[07:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27289.539999999997s)]
*  Ryan and his aid began interviewing temple members and the congressmen. They were all [[07:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27294.42s)]
*  in the same camp. Jim himself was a little disconcerting and the standoffish behavior of [[07:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27299.78s)]
*  many of the people seemed suspicious, but distrusting the government is not a crime. [[07:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27312.34s)]
*  Congressman Ryan found nothing that indicated he was visiting a concentration camp. [[07:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27318.98s)]
*  He didn't see any armed guards, there were no watch towers. [[07:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27324.1s)]
*  The people seemed, you know, healthy enough. They were skinny, but they were healthy enough. [[07:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27327.94s)]
*  And while some were nervous by his visit, you know, their answers to his questions seemed [[07:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27335.86s)]
*  genuine, plausible. So far, so good. By the time the rest of the visitors arrived, [[07:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27341.94s)]
*  it was getting near evening and everyone was beginning to gather at the pavilion for dinner. [[07:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27350.02s)]
*  The settlers were looking forward to this meal because they knew it was going to be special [[07:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27356.5s)]
*  and it was. For once, they got pork and fried chicken, they had greens, potatoes, biscuits. [[07:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27360.5s)]
*  This is the best meal they had in a long time. Jim sat at the table to one side and answered [[07:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27366.98s)]
*  questions from the reporters. There's video of this and he's shaky, but he held up. [[07:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27373.14s)]
*  At one point, he had John Victor brought to him and he's holding them up and showing the [[07:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27380.02s)]
*  reporters how much they looked alike. The good meal put everybody in a good mood. [[07:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27383.460000000003s)]
*  The Jonestown band's playing R&B hits on stage and people get up and they start dancing and [[07:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27390.5s)]
*  singing along and even some of Ryan's entourage are kind of feeling it. [[07:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27395.940000000002s)]
*  Then the band played Earth, Wind and Fires, That's the Way of the World. You know the song. [[07:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27410.02s)]
*  That's the way of the world. Plant your flower and you grow a pearl. You know a child is born [[07:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27418.58s)]
*  with a heart of gold. Way of the world makes his heart grow cold. [[07:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27429.22s)]
*  One more time for Diane. After the song, Congressman Ryan was invited to say a few words to the [[07:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27459.22s)]
*  community and the members who survived the next 24 hours, even ones who hate Jim's guts today, [[07:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27464.98s)]
*  they all swear that what happened afterward was totally spontaneous. [[07:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27473.86s)]
*  So we are at least friends to that extent. I'm very glad to be here. This is a congressional [[07:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27479.460000000003s)]
*  inquiry. I think that all of you know that I'm here to find out more about [[07:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27485.54s)]
*  questions that have been raised about your operation here. I can tell you right now that [[07:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27489.620000000003s)]
*  from the few conversations I've had with some of the folks here already this evening that [[07:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27492.9s)]
*  whatever the comments are there are some people here who believe that this is the [[07:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27497.46s)]
*  best thing that ever happened in their whole life. [[07:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27500.66s)]
*  As the festivities wrapped up for the night, a few people noticed that members of the NBC News [[07:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27515.54s)]
*  crew seemed preoccupied with something. One member of the temple had passed them a note asking for [[07:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27536.5s)]
*  their help getting out of Jonestown, but no one else knew that yet. The visitors to Jonestown [[07:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27542.18s)]
*  were told that there wasn't enough room for anybody except for Congressman Ryan and one [[07:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27549.38s)]
*  other person to stay in Jonestown for the night, and so everybody else was taken back to Port [[07:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27553.78s)]
*  Kaituma. Then Ryan was informed of the note and over the course of the night starts formulating [[07:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27558.66s)]
*  a plan about what to do. The reporters are back in Port Kaituma drinking beer and kind of going [[07:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27566.1s)]
*  over everything that they'd seen during the day, and by now Jim Jones would have known about the [[07:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27572.18s)]
*  note as well. Only a few people picked up on this as it happened, but a young boy who had seen it [[07:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27576.899999999998s)]
*  being passed called it out. But rather than reacting to the news, Jim just disappeared into [[07:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27583.78s)]
*  his cottage for the night and that was the last anybody saw of him. The next day everybody returned [[07:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27592.42s)]
*  to Jonestown, and right away there was a heaviness in the air. When Jim finally emerged from his [[07:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27599.059999999998s)]
*  cottage, much later than everybody else, it was immediately apparent that something was wrong with [[07:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27607.219999999998s)]
*  him. He ambled around unsteadily, clenching and unclenching his jaw and working his tongue around [[07:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27613.219999999998s)]
*  his mouth non-stop. He was so high he could hardly speak, but he consented to do an interview with [[07:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27620.98s)]
*  NBC News, and the reporter confronted him with the note from the would-be defector. [[07:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27627.86s)]
*  He slurred his way through it, said that the defectors were lying, said they could leave any [[07:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27633.7s)]
*  time they wanted, pointed out that one of the people who said he wanted to leave, the guy who [[07:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27639.06s)]
*  passed the note actually, was leaving his son behind in Jonestown, which was true. The man, [[07:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27643.46s)]
*  Vernon Gosney, was a long-time drug addict who had essentially abandoned his son to the care of [[07:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27650.02s)]
*  the temple, and he was planning to leave without him, and he actually did leave without him, [[07:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27655.38s)]
*  and his son died there that day as his father scurried off. [[07:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27660.5s)]
*  Soon others began to approach the congressman, saying that they wanted to leave. First one, [[07:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27667.06s)]
*  then a handful, then about two dozen in total, and Jim is going around pleading with his people to [[07:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27673.46s)]
*  stay and promising to make changes in Jonestown, whatever it takes, but the people are unmoved. [[07:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27679.22s)]
*  Several of these people were from two big families that had been with Jim since Indiana. [[07:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27685.54s)]
*  One of the families was the Bogues, whose daughter Juanita was three months pregnant, [[07:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27691.38s)]
*  and whose boy Tommy was one of the two who'd been placed in leg irons who were trying to leave camp. [[07:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27694.98s)]
*  Some were leaving while their family members insisted on staying, [[07:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27702.260000000002s)]
*  and some of those wanted to take their children against the will of those remaining. [[07:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27705.94s)]
*  People are screaming at each other, you can't take my kids, you bring my kids back here, [[07:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27709.94s)]
*  as other people are carrying their kids toward the trailer to leave. The whole community is in one [[07:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27714.26s)]
*  place now, and things are getting extremely tense. The defectors were speaking to Congressman Ryan [[07:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27719.38s)]
*  and his aide and telling them that we got to get out of here now. We're in danger, and Ryan, [[07:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27725.46s)]
*  he's totally oblivious, he doesn't understand at all the situation that he's in. He tells them to [[07:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27732.74s)]
*  relax, you're all protected by the shield of the U.S. Congress, there's media here, there's NBC news [[07:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27738.9s)]
*  cameras here, you're fine. Jim tells the reporters, hey, these people could have left any time they [[07:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27744.18s)]
*  wanted. I don't know why there's such a big hullabaloo, they can leave whenever they wanted, [[07:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27750.5s)]
*  they can certainly leave now, and if they ever want to come back, of course they'll be welcome. [[07:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27755.7s)]
*  Farewell. There were enough people now who wanted to leave that they were going to have to be [[07:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27761.219999999998s)]
*  brought to the airstrip in two trips. As arrangements were being made, the sky suddenly, [[07:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27766.66s)]
*  very suddenly, just went black, and thunder tore across it, and wind starts ripping through the [[07:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27773.539999999997s)]
*  camp, and everybody rushed to the covered pavilion as torrents of rain began pouring down, [[07:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27779.699999999997s)]
*  heavier than anyone who was there could ever remember having seen in Jonestown in the whole [[07:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27785.300000000003s)]
*  year that they'd been there. Everybody's on edge, wondering what's going to happen, [[07:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27790.18s)]
*  as nearly a thousand people now are huddled together under the cover, eyeing each other [[07:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27797.300000000003s)]
*  warily, looking at Jim, looking at the defectors, looking at the congressmen. [[07:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27802.5s)]
*  Jim's lawyers are telling him, look, having two dozen people out of [[07:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27808.820000000003s)]
*  a thousand wanting to leave, that is not a problem. On the flight the day before to Port [[07:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27813.300000000003s)]
*  Kaituma, Mark Lane had told the Washington Post reporter that he expected maybe 90% of the people [[07:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27818.9s)]
*  to stay, so that would have meant maybe 90 or 100 people leaving. Turned out that 97% of the people [[07:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27825.06s)]
*  wanted to stay, and so they told him, look, the story is not the defectors, the story is the people [[07:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27832.260000000002s)]
*  who are staying. We can sell that story, that's no problem, there's nothing to worry about. [[07:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27837.940000000002s)]
*  And as quickly as it came, the rain ebbed, and people began to make their way through the muck [[07:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27843.54s)]
*  to be transported to the airstrip. As they were getting there, another man ran toward the trailer, [[07:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27849.38s)]
*  holding a small child under each arm, saying that he wanted to leave as well, but he was tailed by [[07:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27855.86s)]
*  their mother, who was tugging at the kids and screaming that they were her children too, and [[07:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27860.58s)]
*  he couldn't take them. Other people joined the commotion, and people began to argue, and Jim is [[07:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27864.02s)]
*  standing apart with several of his most trusted aides, and they're all whispering to each other, [[07:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27870.100000000002s)]
*  and the trailer was full, and so Congressman Ryan tells them to get moving to the airstrip, [[07:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27874.66s)]
*  drop them off, and come back, and I'm going to stay behind and try to work out a compromise [[07:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27880.420000000002s)]
*  between these quarreling parents, and then I'll come back with a second load. [[07:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27884.18s)]
*  And so the first batch of defectors takes off down the jungle path. [[07:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27888.02s)]
*  At the very last moment, Larry Layton, one of Jim's most loyal lap dogs, Carolyn's original husband, [[07:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27892.260000000002s)]
*  who had given her up when Jim set his eyes on her. This is the guy who used to stand on the [[07:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27899.38s)]
*  side of the stage with a cup while Jim would be ranting all night so that Jim wouldn't have to [[07:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27904.260000000002s)]
*  step away when he urinated. Larry Layton would hold the cup, and Jim would piss into that. [[07:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27909.54s)]
*  He runs off toward the trailer, saying he wants to leave as well, and right then the defectors [[07:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27914.5s)]
*  who were on the trailer are like, no, no, no, no, no, I don't buy this. This guy can't be trusted. [[07:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27919.3s)]
*  There's no way that that guy would want to leave, but he was allowed on board, [[07:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27923.14s)]
*  and the trailer disappeared into the jungle as the remaining members who were staying behind [[07:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27928.34s)]
*  shouted curses at these traitors. Before they were out of hearing range of Jonestown, they heard more [[07:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27933.3s)]
*  shouting erupt. As Ryan was trying to intercede between these two fighting parents, a temple [[07:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27941.06s)]
*  member and former Vietnam vet named Don Sly grabbed the congressman from behind and said, [[07:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27947.14s)]
*  you're going to die, motherfucker, and put a knife to his throat, and he would have killed him. But [[07:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27951.780000000002s)]
*  the temple lawyers happened to be standing right there, and they jumped him and wrestled the knife [[07:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27956.1s)]
*  away. Blood covered the congressman's shirt, but he wasn't cut. It was from his attacker who'd been [[07:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27959.94s)]
*  cut in the struggle. Ryan's shaken, but he's not harmed, and Jim calmly walks over as the congressman [[07:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27965.94s)]
*  is getting his bearings and Don Sly's being dragged away, and he says in a very calm voice [[07:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27974.34s)]
*  that everybody thought was strange, does this change everything? And Ryan replies, well, [[07:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27979.219999999998s)]
*  it doesn't change everything, but it changes some things. The lawyers are trying to salvage this [[07:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27986.18s)]
*  situation. They ask if anything could be done, you know, what do we have to do? And Ryan's trying to [[07:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27993.059999999998s)]
*  hold it together, and he says, you know, look, it's a very stressful situation for everyone. [[07:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=27997.219999999998s)]
*  As long as the guy's handed over to the police, I can live with that. But at this point, alarm bells [[07:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28001.94s)]
*  are starting to go off for Congressman Ryan, and he takes off down the path toward the tractor, [[07:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28007.219999999998s)]
*  which had become stuck in the mud a few minutes out of Jonestown and soon catches up to them. [[07:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28012.42s)]
*  The tractor and the trailer are unstuck, and they continue their way toward the airstrip, [[07:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28018.339999999997s)]
*  and back in Jonestown, Tim Carter remembers Harriet Tropp looking at him and saying, [[07:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28023.14s)]
*  as matter of factly as if she were discussing the weather, well, I guess we're all going to die now. [[07:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28029.94s)]
*  The air was still, and Jim is so high on drugs, he can hardly speak, and people remember him [[07:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28035.38s)]
*  taking it all in and slurring. I've never seen Jonestown so peaceful. [[07:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28043.86s)]
*  There was a problem at the airstrip. The number of people leaving had grown to the point that [[07:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28053.38s)]
*  two planes were going to be needed to bring them all back to Georgetown. And they were [[07:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28059.460000000003s)]
*  haggling over who was going to leave with the first plane. Some of the journalists had short [[07:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28064.02s)]
*  deadlines and so forth, and who was going to stay behind to wait for the second one. Ryan was giving [[07:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28067.7s)]
*  an interview to some of the reporters. Larry Layton took a seat on the first plane with several [[07:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28072.260000000002s)]
*  reporters and a few of the concerned relatives. And at that moment, another tractor with a trailer [[07:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28077.62s)]
*  emerged from the jungle path to Jonestown out onto the airstrip and made its way in a wide circle [[07:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28084.5s)]
*  around the plane and people and placed itself between the group of people and the closest path [[07:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28090.66s)]
*  to the jungle. And then it came to a stop. And several men emerged from the trailer with guns [[07:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28097.379999999997s)]
*  and began firing at the people assembled near the plane. On the plane, Larry Layton pulled a [[07:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28103.94s)]
*  pistol that he had hidden away and began shooting at the seated passengers. He shot two people [[07:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28109.059999999998s)]
*  before others overtook him and wrestled him to the ground. But outside of the plane, the [[07:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28114.1s)]
*  people were tearing into the plane and into the bodies of the people as they scrambled for cover. [[07:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28118.5s)]
*  One defector, a woman who had been with the church since Indiana was shot in the back of the head [[07:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28127.859999999997s)]
*  while she was climbing the gangplank to board the plane. Congressman Ryan went down as did his [[07:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28132.179999999997s)]
*  aide Jackie Spear and Don Harris, photographer Greg Robinson, NBC cameraman Bob Brown and soundman [[07:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28137.94s)]
*  Steve Sung. Anthony Katsaris Maria's brother was shot as were San Francisco Chronicle reporter [[07:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28144.82s)]
*  Tim Reiterman, the US embassy official and a concerned relative named Beverly Oliver. [[07:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28151.3s)]
*  Those who were alive and able to took off into the jungle. Those who were still breathing but [[07:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28157.38s)]
*  couldn't run played dead. One of these was Jackie Spear and she heard the footsteps of the temple [[07:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUHRth307w&t=28162.82s)]
