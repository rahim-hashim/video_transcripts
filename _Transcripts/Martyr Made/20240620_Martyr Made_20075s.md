Video Description: In August 1921, 10,000-20,000 armed coal miners marched on Mingo County, West Virginia to lift the martial law imposed there, free their jailed brethren, and avenge the assassination of one of their local heroes. At least 20,000 more wives, young boys and other civilians followed the army providing medical, logistical and other services. Before it was over, they would storm a mountainside under fire from entrenched machine guns, and while being bombed from the air. It was the largest and most serious armed insurrection in US history since the Civil War. This episode is going to discuss the West Virginia Coal Mine Wars, and The Battle of Blair Mountain.

# #22 Whose America?, ep. 1: Rough Extraction
**Martyr Made:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4)
*  What is up everybody? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=0.0s)]
*  This is Darrell Cooper. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6.0s)]
*  This is the Martyr Made Podcast and you are about to listen to Who's America? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=7.94s)]
*  Episode 1. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14.76s)]
*  This one is called Rough Extraction. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=17.48s)]
*  It's about the West Virginia coal mine wars. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=21.56s)]
*  It happens to be the largest and most serious uprising in the history of the United States [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=25.32s)]
*  since the Civil War. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=32.36s)]
*  You would have had this episode a few days sooner. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=35.92s)]
*  I really wanted to get it out on Labor Day. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=38.36s)]
*  But this story, I love this story. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=41.6s)]
*  As an American, I love this story. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=45.44s)]
*  And it's really important to me to get it right. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=48.96s)]
*  I'm still not 100% sure that I got it right. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=50.76s)]
*  But I put the work in if nothing else. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  I've literally reworked this thing from scratch four times. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=56.6s)]
*  I've tried recording it a couple times. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=62.08s)]
*  I was trying to fit in all of the context and all of the great stories that I think [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=64.0s)]
*  are necessary to really get underneath the skin of this story and to give it the dramatic [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=67.8s)]
*  oomph I wanted to give it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Because I want everybody to love this story as much as I do. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=76.4s)]
*  But every time I tried, I'd get two and a half hours into the thing and realize that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=80.0s)]
*  I haven't even mentioned coal mining yet. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=86.44s)]
*  I know surprise surprise, Martyr Made Podcast takes a long time to get to the point. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=90.04s)]
*  But it was just going on too long. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=95.04s)]
*  And so I would try again. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=96.76s)]
*  I would try again because I didn't want to give up all this great stuff about the Hatfield [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=98.12s)]
*  and McCoy feud, most famous Klan feud in American history. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=103.6s)]
*  In just a few decades, a couple decades actually before the story I'm telling here in the very [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=107.72s)]
*  same valley there along the West Virginia Kentucky border. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=112.32s)]
*  And telling that story, telling its background, the social history, the history of the economic [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=117.16s)]
*  and political changes that were happening in southern Appalachia at the time, which [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=122.12s)]
*  in a lot of ways led to the Hatfield McCoy feud, which shed a lot of light on this story. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=127.32s)]
*  And so I wanted to get that in there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=131.6s)]
*  I wanted to talk about the philosophy and politics behind America's push toward industrialization [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=135.2s)]
*  and how it came into conflict with those few remaining traditional communities that still existed in the country. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=141.96s)]
*  I wanted to tell you all about the history of the Scots Irish and the English borderers [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  who settled Appalachia and whose culture of honor, the miners of West Virginia, wherever [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=157.96s)]
*  they'd come from, were assimilated into. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  In the end, I had no choice but to drop or abbreviate a lot of that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=171.56s)]
*  And I am quite sad about it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=175.32s)]
*  I'm still not. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=177.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I just can't redo this thing again. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=179.24s)]
*  So the good news, there is a silver lining here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=183.4s)]
*  The good news is that I've got a Substack page. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=187.48s)]
*  That's martyrmade.substack.com. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=190.67999999999998s)]
*  It's linked in the show notes. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=193.48s)]
*  And all of that other material that didn't make it into this episode is going to make [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=195.76s)]
*  for some great content that will be appearing there very soon. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=199.44s)]
*  The Hatfield McCoy feud by itself is, I could probably make a series out of that, but I'll [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  at least get one hell of an episode out of it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=208.6s)]
*  So if you want to learn how everything you thought you knew about the Hatfield McCoy [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=211.72s)]
*  feud, probably wrong. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=215.28s)]
*  Head on over to the Substack and sign up. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=218.56s)]
*  It'll be over there soon. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=220.16s)]
*  Paid subscribers to the Substack have access to a whole list of articles and podcasts not [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=222.16s)]
*  available on the main feed, the history feed, including episode three of my series on Jeffrey [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=227.84s)]
*  Epstein. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=233.24s)]
*  Those of you who follow the main feed have probably heard the first two. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=235.12s)]
*  It's on there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=238.68s)]
*  The final episode can be found on Substack and I promise you I bring my flamethrower [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=240.0s)]
*  to that one. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=245.52s)]
*  Last but not least, I want to encourage everybody out there to go to originmain.com. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  That's origin. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=256.8s)]
*  You all can spell that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=257.8s)]
*  Main with an E like the state.com. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=259.76s)]
*  That is the website for Jaco's company, Jaco Willink, my cohost on the unraveling. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=263.56s)]
*  If you have not checked out that podcast, you really should. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=270.88s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, to answer a question I've been getting a lot lately. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=274.08s)]
*  We will be putting out new unravelings very soon. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=279.4s)]
*  Jaco has had a busy schedule to say the least lately. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=282.0s)]
*  I know that's a shock too. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=286.2s)]
*  I want you to go over there to originmain.com and not just because Jaco is my buddy. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=289.6s)]
*  They make a whole range of some of my favorite things. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=294.24s)]
*  They make my favorite energy drinks for one. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=299.6s)]
*  I am unfortunately a caffeine addict. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=301.76s)]
*  These energy drinks, Jaco Go they're called, are available in some stores now. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=304.92s)]
*  I think Wawa is out on the East Coast and hopefully some more soon. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=310.04s)]
*  They're pretty much the only energy drinks that don't make me crash and send me back [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=315.0s)]
*  to the well after an hour or two. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=318.0s)]
*  I love them. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=319.64s)]
*  They're not all packed in with sugar or anything like that, or even artificial sweeteners. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=320.64s)]
*  I think they're sweetened with monk fruit. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=324.04s)]
*  They're really good. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=325.4s)]
*  The Rift Jujitsu Gi that they make is just without question the best Gi I've ever rolled [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=327.56s)]
*  in. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=332.68s)]
*  So if you're into that kind of thing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=333.68s)]
*  One of you guys out there, this was crazy. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=336.8s)]
*  One of you guys was kind enough to get me a pair of the Buffalo Hide boots that Origin [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=338.76s)]
*  makes. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=343.88s)]
*  I gotta say that by itself probably made all the hours doing this podcast over the years [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=345.12s)]
*  worth it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=350.56s)]
*  It was a huge surprise and it really meant a lot. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=351.56s)]
*  But then on top of it, they're easily the best boots I've ever had, just by far. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=356.2s)]
*  They're the kind of things that you want to go out and do hard work in, but then they [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=361.0s)]
*  feel so nice that you almost don't want to do that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=366.68s)]
*  So I'm not exactly sure how to use them yet, whether to wear them out in the fields or [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=369.84s)]
*  just wear them out when I go to a nice dinner, but I'll figure that out. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=374.0s)]
*  And now, just now in fact, they've got gear from Jaco's new hunting line. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=379.2s)]
*  And so if you're into hunting at all, go check it out. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=385.72s)]
*  I don't know how to describe this stuff exactly. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=390.64s)]
*  And I've been into hunting often on my whole life. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=394.16s)]
*  I've never quite seen anything like what Jaco's got going here. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=398.12s)]
*  I don't know how quite to describe it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=402.0s)]
*  I mean, it looks like you're going hunting while preparing for combat, I guess, maybe. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=403.88s)]
*  But just go check it out. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=408.88s)]
*  Trust me, just go check it out. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=410.52s)]
*  And again, that is originmain.com. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=411.79999999999995s)]
*  The link is in the show notes. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  OK. Oh, actually, one other thing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  Many of you guys have heard me mention my good friend, Daniele Bollelli before. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=420.4s)]
*  He's the host of one of the very best OG history podcasts out there called History [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=425.44s)]
*  on Fire. History on Fire was one of the biggest and most popular history podcasts [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=430.84s)]
*  out there, which is why the company Luminary, a podcast subscription service, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=436.35999999999996s)]
*  made him an offer he couldn't refuse a few years ago. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=440.91999999999996s)]
*  And so he's been behind a paywall for the last few years. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=443.52s)]
*  But once he was able to, he opted for freedom and he's now back out in the wild. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=446.79999999999995s)]
*  Not everybody knows that yet. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=451.88s)]
*  And so this is a public service announcement for anyone who wants more good [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=453.35999999999996s)]
*  history content, check out History on Fire. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  For those of you who aren't longtime history podcast nerds and haven't been [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=463.36s)]
*  introduced to History on Fire, it's a long form, deep storytelling kind of thing [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=468.0s)]
*  like you're used to with Martyr Made. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=473.08000000000004s)]
*  Although I will say there are some topics that he covers that honestly, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=475.24s)]
*  I think only he can do right. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=479.6s)]
*  The Caravaggio series is one for sure. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=481.68s)]
*  If you want to dip your toe in to see what it's like, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=484.68s)]
*  I recommend the series on Crazy Horse. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=486.64000000000004s)]
*  That's one of my favorites for sure. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=489.48s)]
*  Or the one on the Conquest of Mexico. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=491.72s)]
*  That's an excellent one. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=493.96000000000004s)]
*  So it's called History on Fire and I highly recommend it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=494.96000000000004s)]
*  Like I said, Martyr Made taking a long time to get to the point. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  Surprise, surprise. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  But that's about it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=505.04s)]
*  So again, you're about to listen to Martyr Made number 22. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=506.0s)]
*  Who's America? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=511.56s)]
*  Episode 1, Rough Extraction. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=512.96s)]
*  I hope you enjoy this story as much as I do. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=517.44s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=521.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm content to die for my beliefs. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  So cut off my head and make me a martyr. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=529.2800000000001s)]
*  The people will always remember it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=535.2s)]
*  No. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=539.36s)]
*  They will forget. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=541.28s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=543.8s)]
*  God is a thought. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=546.2s)]
*  God is an idea. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  It is a place. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=550.96s)]
*  It is somewhere. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=552.12s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=555.16s)]
*  But its reference is to something that transcends all things. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=558.32s)]
*  I must cut my head. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=567.24s)]
*  I must tear ourselves apart for this small question of religion. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=568.24s)]
*  Who's America? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=577.52s)]
*  Who is America? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=580.04s)]
*  We started asking some version of those two questions when the Pilgrims landed in North [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=583.32s)]
*  America, probably. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=591.6800000000001s)]
*  We're still asking those questions. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=594.4s)]
*  And the answers have changed over the years. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=597.12s)]
*  Who does America belong to? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=602.5999999999999s)]
*  Who is America? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=604.92s)]
*  Who are the Americans? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=606.3199999999999s)]
*  Back during the Civil War, people went to war against the federal government out of [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  loyalty to their states. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=613.4s)]
*  People in Virginia were Virginians first. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=616.88s)]
*  Their loyalty to the United States was born out of that state's participation in the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=620.8s)]
*  federal system. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=625.12s)]
*  Their grandparents or great grandparents had lived in Virginia before there ever was a [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=628.12s)]
*  United States. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=632.5200000000001s)]
*  And so when those two loyalties came into conflict and the two identities could no longer [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=633.5200000000001s)]
*  coexist, they held to the older one, the one that to them was closer to home. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=639.72s)]
*  Later in the 20th century, the advent of post-colonial liberation movements in the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=648.44s)]
*  Third World, a lot of American citizens whose national origins were in the global south, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=655.36s)]
*  the formerly colonized world, have often been encouraged to think of themselves as diaspora [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  populations, you know, as Hispanics or Africans or Asians or Middle Easterners who just happen [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=669.6s)]
*  to be residing in the United States. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  But that national origin or that ethnic identity, you know, they're told from a certain standpoint [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=678.2s)]
*  should be their primary mode of identification. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=683.88s)]
*  Marxists never got much hold in the U.S., but they would have had us understand ourselves [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=689.1600000000001s)]
*  in terms of class relations, right? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=693.32s)]
*  A bunch of bourgeois exploiters and then the real Americans, the workers. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=696.4000000000001s)]
*  Some groups, Catholic immigrants, for example, Jews, you know, Irish, Italians, Slobs, other [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=703.56s)]
*  Europeans, over the years were castigated for not assimilating quickly enough, not assimilating [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=710.52s)]
*  into American society, being hyphenated Americans, they were called, even as their assimilation [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=717.88s)]
*  was resisted and sometimes blocked by important segments of American society. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=725.4799999999999s)]
*  So who's America? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=731.86s)]
*  The author Colin Woodward brought out an interesting formulation in his great little book, American [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=736.42s)]
*  Nations it's called, subtitled The History of the Eleven Regional Cultures in North America. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=745.3000000000001s)]
*  I know you've heard me mention the book Albion Seed before about the four major British migrations [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=752.66s)]
*  into what became America. It's a fantastic book and this is actually a great supplement for that book [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=760.82s)]
*  and it's one for people who want a little bit easier and shorter read. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=766.42s)]
*  So Woodward ignores state and national boundaries altogether and he gives us a gerrymandered map [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=771.7s)]
*  of the U.S., Canada, and northern Mexico that tries to mark the cultural and economic zones created by [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=779.62s)]
*  patterns of settlement and migration of successive waves of new Americans over the years. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=788.1s)]
*  As they come in and break against geographic and rival cultural barriers and slosh around and bump [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=793.86s)]
*  up against each other. As the book's title says Woodward identifies 11 of these regions [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=801.78s)]
*  and he gives them names like Yankee-dom, which is probably pretty self-explanatory you would think, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=808.9s)]
*  but yes founded when the pilgrims hit Plymouth Rock but then spreading to eventually encompass [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=815.3s)]
*  New England and the northern strips of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=822.18s)]
*  and then the Great Lakes region up into Michigan and Wisconsin, and even on the other side of the [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=828.9799999999999s)]
*  Great Lakes the Canadian shoreline and Windsor around there he defines as Yankee-dom for cultural [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=834.18s)]
*  and economic and historical reasons that he goes over. Encompassing northern Mexico, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=840.42s)]
*  west Texas, the southern parts of the southwest, and Baja in southern California is the nation he [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=848.8199999999999s)]
*  calls El Norte, which he reminds us is the oldest of the American nations settled by the Spanish in [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=855.9399999999999s)]
*  the 16th century in which today even in the northern Mexican locales like Chihuahua, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=863.14s)]
*  Sonora, or Baja has an economy that faces more toward America than it does toward Mexico City [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=870.98s)]
*  or anything south of it. He points to the deep south founded by English slavers who came from [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=878.42s)]
*  Barbados and brought with them a particularly harsh and despotic racial caste system. He talks [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=888.66s)]
*  about the cavalier tidewater region of the Virginia lowlands and Maryland, southern Delaware, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=895.14s)]
*  northeastern North Carolina I guess would be in there. There's the Midlands, the far west, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=901.38s)]
*  the left coast, and the tiny and short-lived little region of New Netherland he calls it, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=908.3399999999999s)]
*  and there's New France up in Canada over in the east, and then there's the region that I want to [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=914.98s)]
*  talk to you about today. Woodward calls it Greater Appalachia. Quote, Greater Appalachia was founded [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=920.5s)]
*  in the early 18th century by wave upon wave of rough bellicose settlers from the war-ravaged [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=931.22s)]
*  borderlands of Northern Ireland, Northern England, and the Scottish lowlands. Lampooned by riders [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=937.54s)]
*  and journalists, filmmakers and television producers as rednecks, hillbillies, crackers, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=944.18s)]
*  and white trash. Today you'd probably number them among the deplorables. These clannish Scots-Irish [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=949.9399999999999s)]
*  and North English frontiersmen spread across the Highland South and on into the southern [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=957.6999999999999s)]
*  tiers of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. The Arkansas and Missouri Ozarks, the eastern two-thirds of [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=962.18s)]
*  Oklahoma and the hill country of Texas clashing with Indians, Mexicans, and Yankees as they migrated. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=968.74s)]
*  In the British Isles, this culture had formed in a state of near constant war and upheaval, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=977.94s)]
*  fostering a warrior ethic and a deep commitment to individual liberty and personal sovereignty. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=984.02s)]
*  Intensely suspicious of aristocrats and social reformers alike, these American [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=990.82s)]
*  borderlanders despised Yankee teachers, tidewater lords, and deep south aristocrats. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=996.34s)]
*  In the Civil War, much of the region fought for the Union with secession movements in Western [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1003.7800000000001s)]
*  Virginia creating West Virginia, Eastern Tennessee, and Northern Alabama. The borderlanders' [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1009.0600000000001s)]
*  combative culture has provided a large portion of the nation's military from officers like Andrew [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1015.7800000000001s)]
*  Jackson, Davy Crockett, and Douglas MacArthur to the enlisted fighting men in Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1021.46s)]
*  They also gave the continent bluegrass and country music, stock car racing, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1028.58s)]
*  and evangelical fundamentalism. You know, when the federal government sends out census takers [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1033.38s)]
*  to get a read on the demographics of the country every 10 years, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1043.46s)]
*  they always ask about our ethnicity or national origin. You can say Latino, Mexican, Scottish, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1046.74s)]
*  British, African, or Nigerian, whatever you think applies from a broad range of options. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1061.38s)]
*  Throughout the greater Appalachia region, settled by those Scots, Irish, and English borderers [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1068.58s)]
*  who were then joined over the years by Southern blacks, Central and Southern Europeans, and others, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1075.78s)]
*  the vast majority of people in that region simply give their ethnicity as American. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1084.02s)]
*  It's the only region in the country where that's the case. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1093.3799999999999s)]
*  And today I want to tell you a story about these Americans. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1097.7s)]
*  In the summer of 1912, in the mountains of southern West Virginia, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1101.86s)]
*  the Americans were near a state of revolution. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1109.3799999999999s)]
*  Over the course of just a couple decades, they had had imposed on them a social, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1115.4599999999998s)]
*  a cultural, and political, and economic transformation more than ever before. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1124.26s)]
*  More total and more jarring, more rapid than any group had experienced in American history, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1131.86s)]
*  with the possible exception of the Native Americans. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1139.3799999999999s)]
*  At the time of the Civil War, which at the time is within living memory for many of the residents [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1144.34s)]
*  here, southern Appalachia was as isolated politically, culturally, and economically [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1150.5s)]
*  as any place in the United States. I mean, these people were up in the mountains [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1156.8999999999999s)]
*  living their own lives by themselves, and had been for a hundred years. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1161.3s)]
*  There were parts of it that were not electrified until the 1960s. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1166.98s)]
*  The terrain there, and I was there last year for a week, and it is gorgeous country out there, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1174.5s)]
*  but I gotta tell you, the terrain, it's rough. It consists of rugged, wooded hills [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1179.78s)]
*  interrupted by narrow valleys along numerous creeks and small rivers, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1188.8200000000002s)]
*  which makes it totally unsuitable for large-scale farming or cash crop export. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1195.38s)]
*  The hillsides, they just jut straight out of the ground, and they're so steep that they can't be [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1201.14s)]
*  cultivated, and they really can't be used for much of anything other than hunting or, depending on [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1205.94s)]
*  the hillside, maybe grazing a few livestock. What this land could support, though, was small, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1211.38s)]
*  self-sufficient family farms, and so slowly but surely the people worked their way south [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1220.3400000000001s)]
*  through the hills following old Indian trails. The first arrivals would come in and claim the [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1227.38s)]
*  river and creek beds where the tillable land was, and the new arrivals and the grown sons [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1233.94s)]
*  of those families would then move down to the next hollow for their plot, and that's how Appalachia [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1238.5s)]
*  was largely settled. You couldn't build towns there. There's no room to build them and no [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1243.54s)]
*  infrastructure to support them. In this story, we're going to be spending a lot of time in the [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1251.62s)]
*  Tug Valley, which cups a river fork called the Tug that serves as the border between West Virginia [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1258.58s)]
*  and Kentucky. Well, there were no roads into that valley until the 1900s, after Americans had been [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1265.22s)]
*  living there a good hundred years. The whole community had been up there for a hundred years. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1272.98s)]
*  There were no roads into that area. Trade outside the region, virtually nonexistent. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1277.3s)]
*  Even trade from one valley to the next valley was extremely limited because it was just not a simple [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1285.78s)]
*  matter to get around these mountains, especially with cargo before the roads and the railroads came. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1292.02s)]
*  And unlike much of the eastern United States with the Ohio River, the Mississippi River, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1299.78s)]
*  all these navigable rivers that made it easy to transport people and cargo and information [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1305.62s)]
*  over large swaths of land, there was none of that. You've got a bunch of very small [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1311.62s)]
*  and usually short rivers running through rugged mountains. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1316.26s)]
*  If you wanted to get a message to someone in the Tug Valley, you had to hike in there and go tell them. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1321.14s)]
*  Each one of these isolated little valleys had its own little community and its own little culture. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1330.74s)]
*  Sometimes there were even differences in dialect. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1339.78s)]
*  There was no division of labor. It was a primitive economy in that sense. Every household was a [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1343.06s)]
*  self-sufficient unit. Up until the day the coal and railroad companies showed up, these people [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1348.6599999999999s)]
*  were still tanning their own leather to make their own shoes. They were making their own thread and [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1356.5s)]
*  wax, making their own string and rope and cloth from flax and wool, but they were still [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1363.1399999999999s)]
*  carving their own dishes and bowls from cucumber and poplar wood and the hills around them. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1371.54s)]
*  This is a traditional community. And so outsiders, and I don't just mean people from New York and [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1378.8999999999999s)]
*  Philadelphia, but people from the growing towns to the east and north right there in West Virginia [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1385.06s)]
*  or in the other direction in Kentucky, looked at them and saw desperately poor people living [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1390.1799999999998s)]
*  poor people living a primitive lifestyle, people desperately in need of the uplifting hand of [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1397.7s)]
*  the more educated and reform-minded people in the cities. But what they couldn't see was that there [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1406.58s)]
*  was a real tight-knit community life there of a kind that was fading and dying out in [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1414.18s)]
*  the rest of America by that point in our history. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1423.38s)]
*  And the poverty even was, you know, sort of in the eye of the beholder. I mean, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1428.74s)]
*  the people weren't rich obviously by any measure, but they also didn't spend 14 hours a day working [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1435.7800000000002s)]
*  like people in the northern factory cities did. They didn't employ slaves. These people [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1442.5s)]
*  were isolated. They were impoverished from an income standpoint. They were living [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1451.46s)]
*  a primitive lifestyle, traditional lifestyle in many ways, but they were free. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1457.3s)]
*  That's why they had come to America. These people, more than anyone else, came from part of England [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1463.62s)]
*  where they had just been run over in one direction or another by external authority for hundreds, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1468.02s)]
*  really thousands of years. You can follow it all the way back to Julius Caesar. These people have [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1473.3s)]
*  been resisting control by outside authorities. And when they came over to America, they didn't [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1477.22s)]
*  linger in the cities on the coast. They didn't want to be around all that. They went straight [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1483.46s)]
*  out over into south central Pennsylvania and then down into Appalachia and they found their home. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1487.7s)]
*  They were free and they had everything they needed to live and they had plenty of leisure time besides. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1493.94s)]
*  In Altina Waller's great book on the culture of southern Appalachia in the aftermath of the Civil [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1499.14s)]
*  War, she writes, quote, if the importance of land was an 18th century heritage, the Tug Valley social [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1504.1000000000001s)]
*  structure was much more egalitarian in practice than that of Tidewater, Virginia. In the mountainous [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1513.7800000000002s)]
*  terrain, it was not possible to imitate the plantation of the Tug Valley. The Tug Valley [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1520.5s)]
*  was not possible to imitate the plantation system and its polarized society and small farms dominated. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1527.3799999999999s)]
*  In 1850, and I just check this part out, okay, just think about what this means as far as the [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1534.26s)]
*  type of society we're talking about and the relationship the people there have to one another. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1543.22s)]
*  In 1850, more than two-thirds of Pike and Logan counties, those are the two Tug Valley counties [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1548.18s)]
*  straddling the West Virginia-Kentucky line, more than two-thirds of Pike and Logan County households [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1555.06s)]
*  owned their own farms. But even the one-third of households who reported no land holdings do not [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1561.62s)]
*  represent a pauper class. Many such households consisted of young families living on the larger [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1567.86s)]
*  farm of one or the other spouse's families. Such households were part of the parents' domestic [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1573.78s)]
*  economy until such time as the children obtained their own land. Thus, most residents owned or [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1579.7s)]
*  could soon expect to own self-sufficient small farms of 30 to 35 cultivated acres and 300 acres [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1587.14s)]
*  of unimproved land, often mountainsides too steep for anything but hunting or perhaps cattle grazing. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1595.8600000000001s)]
*  Whatever social differentiation existed, economic activity was virtually the same for everyone, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1602.34s)]
*  and poverty was almost unknown. All families participated in a domestic semi-subsistence economy [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1608.1s)]
*  that included cultivating corn, wheat, oats, tobacco, and vegetables. Men and women tended [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1613.86s)]
*  domestic animals such as cattle, swine, sheep, horses, and sometimes oxen. When the family [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1620.5s)]
*  was in the middle of the world, women engaged in home manufacturers for family consumption while [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1627.62s)]
*  men supplemented the family diet with the abundant wild game and fish. Differences between an average [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1631.78s)]
*  and a wealthy family were not in quality of life, but simply in quantity of land, animals, and [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1639.06s)]
*  production of home manufacturers. The undiversified subsistence economy of Tug Valley residents [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1646.26s)]
*  extended up and down the social scale. It sustained a pre-modern lifestyle of hard work [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1652.26s)]
*  alleviated by seasonal rhythms and individual flexibility, a lack of distinction between work [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1658.5s)]
*  and recreation, and a sense of predictability. This subsistence or semi-subsistence economy, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1665.3799999999999s)]
*  however, did not preclude economic and social interaction, interactions that fostered a [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1672.9s)]
*  strong sense of community. If trade beyond the mountains was almost nonexistent, barter and [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1678.02s)]
*  market exchanges within the Tug Valley community itself were extensive. Families were productive [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1683.3799999999999s)]
*  economic units whose tasks were shared with relatives, neighbors, and friends more frequently [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1689.94s)]
*  than not. Hunting, fencing, planting, harvesting, horse trading, and house building were all tasks [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1694.98s)]
*  shared by the men in the neighborhood. Women got together for canning, sewing, and quilting." [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1702.5s)]
*  There's a Japanese proverb that goes, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1710.5s)]
*  negara mawitata desa mawikara, and I know with 99% certainty that I just annihilated that. Sorry, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1713.78s)]
*  but that's how it was spelled in English. It's a very common phrase in Japanese. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1721.38s)]
*  What it means is, the capital has its order, the village its customs. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1725.6200000000001s)]
*  You might say the capital has its laws, the village its customs. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1742.98s)]
*  Well, that had very much applied to the Scots-Irish and the borderlanders for well over a thousand [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1746.34s)]
*  years back in the British Isles, and it followed them, that tendency, to Appalachia when they [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1755.3799999999999s)]
*  migrated to North America. The Mountaineers were far, very far from the attention of state and [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1761.06s)]
*  federal government authorities. Even local government, which they did have, county governments, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1771.62s)]
*  didn't supersede the natural and organic community hierarchy. They reflected it, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1778.42s)]
*  reinforced it. The heads of the prominent and respected families in the area, in other words, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1786.18s)]
*  the men who were already looked to as the leaders in the community, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1793.3799999999999s)]
*  they would hold the government posts like sheriff or judge or what have you. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1797.3799999999999s)]
*  The majority of the people in the late 1800s there were still illiterate, and they had an [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1802.02s)]
*  oral culture's understanding of customary versus legal culture. They lived in a world where deals [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1810.58s)]
*  were made by handshakes with eye contact, where they were binding not because of the letter of [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1816.74s)]
*  some abstract law or contract, but because in a tight-knit community, everybody knew everybody [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1823.3799999999999s)]
*  else's business. Everybody would have known what the agreement was and outlined. In all but the [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1830.66s)]
*  most complicated or difficult cases, there tended to be a consensus over who was in the right or [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1836.3400000000001s)]
*  who was in the wrong. The respected men serving in local government positions exercised their [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1842.1000000000001s)]
*  authority, in other words, not as representatives of some distant system or power structure. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1848.98s)]
*  So, I don't know, not like the U.S. Marshal in old West stories where he's the lone representative [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1855.22s)]
*  of United States law in these here parts. It wasn't like that. The leading men who occupied [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1861.38s)]
*  those local government posts, they exercised their authority as fellow members of the community, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1867.3000000000002s)]
*  and their decisions weren't guided by legal technicalities because they weren't representing [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1874.98s)]
*  some... They weren't representing the laws and decisions of the state legislature or the U.S. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1879.94s)]
*  Congress. They were there to help lead and manage their community, so they didn't make their [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1887.6200000000001s)]
*  decisions by legal technicalities. They made them by common sense and local custom as they perceived [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1891.7s)]
*  it. Of course, modern people hear that. By that, I even mean people from the more developed parts [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1898.3400000000001s)]
*  of the country back then heard it, and they think, well, this is a government of men, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1905.94s)]
*  not a government of laws. Why? How could objectivity and equality before the law [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1912.3400000000001s)]
*  ever exist in a place like that? And the answer is it couldn't. Objectivity was not the goal. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1919.54s)]
*  And to outsiders, it looked like anarchy and disorder, but it wasn't that. Like any community, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1928.5800000000002s)]
*  there were rules, and everybody knew what they were. If two men came in with a dispute, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1935.22s)]
*  he said he said dispute or something happened, and one of them... Everybody in the community [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1943.3s)]
*  knows everybody else. They all know each other very well, and they know that this guy over here [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1947.22s)]
*  doesn't lie, is honest in his dealings, is generous and helpful in the community, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1953.22s)]
*  and this other guy over here is kind of an heir to wealth, who's always causing problems. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1960.34s)]
*  These guys end up in court, and one of them says one thing, one of them says the other. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1964.1799999999998s)]
*  It's not going to come down to a technicality in the law. They're going to look at these two people, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1968.34s)]
*  and everybody's going to kind of know what happened. Just like in a very, very small [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1973.3799999999999s)]
*  group of people, like your friends or family, when something happens, you usually don't have [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1978.26s)]
*  to hear all the details. Given who's involved, you can probably get a pretty good idea. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1982.58s)]
*  A defendant in a civil or criminal dispute was not coming in and arguing his case [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1987.86s)]
*  before some objective standard. He was arguing his case to the community in which he lived, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=1993.94s)]
*  and on which he depended. In a court presided over by a leading citizen, everybody in the community [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2001.46s)]
*  agreed was a reasonable and a fair man. And so, it was not anarchy, because this guy was [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2007.54s)]
*  decisions that were made through these means were almost always respected [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2016.82s)]
*  for the simple reason that anyone who tried to buck the system knew that they would be going [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2022.18s)]
*  against the whole community, and it very rarely happened. These were some of the very last people [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2025.86s)]
*  in America who were still living in a truly traditional way. It was self-sufficient households [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2033.78s)]
*  organized into a community that governed itself by common agreement. It could have done just fine [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2041.8600000000001s)]
*  without any government at all. No question about that. The Civil War gave him the opportunity to [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2047.94s)]
*  prove that. During the Civil War, civil society just completely broke down in southern West [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2054.6600000000003s)]
*  Virginia in many ways. When Union forces under future President James Garfield came in and [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2062.1800000000003s)]
*  started burning things down, arresting people, they burned down the courthouse. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2068.02s)]
*  So, the courts, for example, didn't function throughout the Civil War in there. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2073.06s)]
*  The local citizens were out in the forest fighting a guerrilla war against the northern occupiers. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2076.9s)]
*  When the war was over, those leading citizens in the county, those natural leaders that everyone [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2083.54s)]
*  looked to without having to be told to, most of those guys were now excluded from local government [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2090.98s)]
*  by the Northern Reconstruction Regime because of their real or suspected sympathies for the [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2097.22s)]
*  Confederacy. So, the Civil War ends and the whole traditional way that these people were used to [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2102.5s)]
*  governing themselves was completely thrown out and turned on its head. Those positions were all [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2110.3399999999997s)]
*  taken up now by people from the cities, people from other walks of life. They weren't the natural [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2115.2999999999997s)]
*  leaders in the community at many, many times. Residents of southern Appalachia, after the war, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2121.7s)]
*  went to work immediately trying to put their communities back together along lines that they [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2130.58s)]
*  recognized. But even as they were getting started with the rebuilding project, there was another war [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2136.02s)]
*  coming their way. Like many wars, this one was first announced by the arrival of refugees driven [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2141.8599999999997s)]
*  before the invading force. See, long before any of the residents had any idea, land speculators [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2150.5s)]
*  from the big cities knew that railroads and mining companies, steel concerns and Wall Street firms [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2160.9s)]
*  were gearing up to develop the coal resources in Appalachia. It's one of the richest coal regions [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2168.9s)]
*  in the world. That meant that those impoverished mountaineers living up there on their small farms [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2175.14s)]
*  were sitting on land that was going to explode in value very soon. And so, very quietly at first, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2183.3799999999997s)]
*  out-of-towners started coming in, you know, waving hundred dollar bills like the song goes, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2191.94s)]
*  to try to get these families to sell out cheap because they didn't know any better. A few did, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2198.1s)]
*  but not very many, not enough. And so, clever men went to the county registrars to see which of those [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2203.3s)]
*  mountaineer families' ancestors had failed maybe to cross every i and dot every t during the Wild [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2210.1800000000003s)]
*  West period three or four generations back when the hills were settled. They checked to see who [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2215.94s)]
*  was fully current on their property taxes going back a hundred years. You know, these people, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2223.7000000000003s)]
*  these people had never really thought about government, okay? You know, the government had [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2229.94s)]
*  never much thought about them. Their ancestors settled these places 100, 120, 150 years ago, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2235.2200000000003s)]
*  and they just lived out there in the wilderness, growing and fishing and hunting just enough food [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2242.18s)]
*  to feed themselves, taking care of themselves, not bothering anybody, not asking anything from anybody. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2247.2200000000003s)]
*  There's very little cash money circulating in the area at all, and for the most part, the furthest [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2253.6200000000003s)]
*  thing from any of their minds was that they might owe tribute to some distant government. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2260.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, pretty soon, families started getting served with summons to come to court and prove [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2267.7000000000003s)]
*  that the land they lived on for generations was really theirs. Some rich guy or some corporate [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2272.34s)]
*  from a far away city would have went and found someone with a discrepancy and said, well, they [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2279.7s)]
*  don't really own this land, so I'm putting a claim down on that land. I'll pay X amount to it for the [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2284.02s)]
*  county, to the county, etc. Those clever rich men from the big city who dragged these people into [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2288.58s)]
*  court, once they got there, obviously had massive advantages. Like, for example, I don't know, they [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2294.58s)]
*  had lawyers or they were literate. They were dragging these mountain people into a world they [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2300.98s)]
*  didn't understand at all, and they just took advantage of them hard. There were many recorded [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2305.14s)]
*  instances of outright fraud. Many of them. In one case, an out-of-town businessman signed a contract [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2310.42s)]
*  in the presence of witnesses with a local firm, a local police officer, and a local police officer [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2317.78s)]
*  to purchase a piece of his land for such and such amount. The farmer put his mark to the paper. He [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2325.54s)]
*  was an illiterate farmer, put his mark to the paper, and the businessman gave him his down payment, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2337.7799999999997s)]
*  and they went on their way, the farmer expecting to settle up the rest of the payment soon. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2342.58s)]
*  Well, when that wasn't forthcoming, the farmer went to the courthouse [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2348.1s)]
*  to go complain, and he brought his copy of the contract. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2352.7400000000002s)]
*  It was only then that this illiterate farmer was made to understand that he had not signed a contract [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2358.6600000000003s)]
*  to sell part of his land for such and such an amount, but had in fact signed to sell all of it [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2365.38s)]
*  for the amount of the small down payment that he'd already gotten. The farmer just did not live in a [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2372.26s)]
*  world where a trick like that was really possible, because in his world, many people would have been [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2379.22s)]
*  privy to the engagement as they were. They were witnesses. So when it went to court, the judge, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2386.5s)]
*  who would have been the head of a prominent local family, would listen and voice the decision of the [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2392.66s)]
*  entire community, the common sense, ethical decision as they would understand it, when he said, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2398.8999999999996s)]
*  well, this businessman, obviously what he did wasn't fair. You took advantage of this man's [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2404.18s)]
*  illiteracy in front of witnesses, no less. So I'm going to give you protection to get you out of the [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2408.74s)]
*  county safely, but I would not advise a return visit. That's how it would have been handled. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2414.74s)]
*  All of a sudden, that's just not how things were. All of a sudden, we had gone very quickly from [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2420.2599999999998s)]
*  a customary culture to a legal culture. In the case of this farmer, it was he who soon enough [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2427.7s)]
*  received a court summons. When he went to court expecting to confront the man who was trying to [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2435.22s)]
*  steal his family's inheritance, the land they'd settled for several generations, that man wasn't [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2440.8199999999997s)]
*  even there. He lived out of state. It was just his lawyers there. Now the farmer tried to plead his [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2446.8199999999997s)]
*  case in terms that made sense to him, in terms of fairness and common sense. He made a moral and [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2454.9s)]
*  an ethical plea. He's trying to make the point that this just wasn't right. The people in the [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2461.38s)]
*  courtroom may have even agreed with him, but the lawyers just kept saying, well, what does the [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2467.14s)]
*  contract say? What does the contract say? You say our client agreed to different terms verbally, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2473.2200000000003s)]
*  but where's the proof for that? The writing on the page is pretty plain, and that is your mark, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2479.54s)]
*  is it not? That farmer lost his family's land, and something like that happened to a lot, a lot of [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2484.98s)]
*  families. Pretty soon, even the people who could prove clean title and that they were documented [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2496.74s)]
*  to be up to date on their taxes, were finding that the neighborhood wasn't quite what it used [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2504.9s)]
*  to be. The neighbors to the left and the neighbors to the right had both been run off their land. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2510.02s)]
*  On both plots of land, to either side, you're starting to see a lot of people you don't recognize. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2517.46s)]
*  A lot of people no one recognizes coming around all the time. They start cutting down all the [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2523.3s)]
*  trees and using the lumber to lay railroad tracks and build buildings. They start importing strange [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2529.3s)]
*  machinery and punching holes into the mountainside. And then, like a flash flood, I mean, that's the [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2536.26s)]
*  only metaphor I can think of that makes sense. Like a flash flood, they begin importing thousands, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2546.1000000000004s)]
*  and then tens of thousands of workers from big East Coast cities, many of them straight off the [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2552.7400000000002s)]
*  immigration boat, speaking any number of mutually indecipherable languages. This is in a sparsely [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2557.7s)]
*  populated community, and they are just overwhelming them. A newspaper article from a century ago [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2564.66s)]
*  written by a visiting New Yorker read, quote, miners came into the valley with a rush. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2572.4199999999996s)]
*  Welsh coal diggers from the pits of Kidwelly, Englishmen from Lancashire, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2579.9399999999996s)]
*  Belgians from the coal basins of Hainaut and Liege, these mingled with much larger numbers [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2584.34s)]
*  of Italians, Slavs, Austrians, and Poles. The hills of the state resounded to the languages of foreign [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2590.1000000000004s)]
*  lands. More than 30 nationalities are represented among the workmen in the mines today. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2596.98s)]
*  American miners, however, outnumber the foreigners. They have come from the coal fields of Ohio, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2603.2200000000003s)]
*  Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and other states. Negroes from the Southern cotton fields [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2608.58s)]
*  have found employment in the mines, and not the least, the mountaineers of the state themselves, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2614.42s)]
*  end quote. Well, now these men came from all walks of life, and they weren't screening them [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2620.2599999999998s)]
*  when they put them on the train and sent them down to dig coal, and so a lot of them were [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2627.94s)]
*  unattached men who had questionable backgrounds. And so now to that person who hasn't sold out his [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2632.9s)]
*  land and wants to stay, now he's starting to see a new element move into the neighborhood. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2643.86s)]
*  Your one mine operator recalled that quote, the thousands of men, soon tens of thousands, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2650.6600000000003s)]
*  who dug that first coal were a hard-bitten lot. They drank and fought and gambled and hoarded. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2656.26s)]
*  With the forest stripped from the mountainsides, the game that the people and their ancestors had [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2663.78s)]
*  hunted for meat for so many years was no longer to be found in abundance. The rivers were all fished [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2670.82s)]
*  out by the countless new arrivals. The people had depended on hunting and fishing to supplement [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2678.1800000000003s)]
*  their diets. It was a necessary, not just important, a necessary aspect of their lives, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2684.7400000000002s)]
*  and everybody knew that in the community, and that's why it had always been considered [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2690.1s)]
*  not just unwise but utterly immoral and antisocial for people to cut down their forest to sell his [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2694.98s)]
*  lumber. Like really, it was looked at the way people might look at a drug dealer or a pimp today [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2702.82s)]
*  if you were going around doing large-scale timber operations. You'd cut down a tree here and a tree [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2708.42s)]
*  there to build a barn or whatever you got to do, but everybody understood that we need these [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2713.54s)]
*  forests here to support the herds of game, the squirrels, the rabbits, everything else that we [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2719.54s)]
*  all need to live. To make matters worse, in what forests remained, government agents were all of [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2723.22s)]
*  a sudden out there on the prowl for poachers, a term that in the past meant to these people that [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2732.18s)]
*  you were trespassing to hunt someone else's land without their permission, but which now had acquired [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2737.54s)]
*  the novel meaning of hunting outside the limited parameters defined by the state or federal government. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2743.38s)]
*  Now I'm all for conservation and conservation laws, but again these people, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2749.7000000000003s)]
*  this was, this was, they couldn't eat without it. This was how they lived. The hills were also all [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2757.54s)]
*  of a sudden crawling with revenue agents who were coming in and busting the local people for making [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2765.1400000000003s)]
*  money and trading their own liquor without paying the liquor taxes. The people were just doing what [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2770.74s)]
*  they had always done, what their ancestors had always done, putting aside a little plot to grow [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2777.22s)]
*  some grain and cobbling together a makeshift home distillery. These people couldn't exactly go to [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2782.1s)]
*  Bevmo and whip out their visa card. You know, if they wanted liquor, they made it themselves. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2788.02s)]
*  It's just the only way to do it. They drank it themselves or they shared it with friends and family [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2793.8599999999997s)]
*  or on market days or community gatherings. They might sell or trade some of it to other people [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2800.74s)]
*  and nobody cared because nobody cared what these people were doing by themselves up in their hills. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2806.2599999999998s)]
*  But now all of a sudden very important people with a lot of resources looked at those hills and saw [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2814.5s)]
*  dollar signs and so they cared very much what the people who lived there were up to. So the place [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2820.5s)]
*  was just not what it had been even five or ten years earlier. And pretty soon that farmer who [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2830.42s)]
*  had the clean title and was all up to date on his taxes, he just decides there's nothing left for him [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2837.46s)]
*  to do except sell his land and try to move somewhere else. Many of them headed to other parts of [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2841.78s)]
*  Appalachia to family or to find a new place to settle, but they were already pretty far south [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2849.46s)]
*  on the path of settlement. There wasn't a whole lot of extra room left to move into. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2856.58s)]
*  Where they did move, they brought with them warnings, you know, about this invasion that was heading their way. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2861.7s)]
*  Many of them had nowhere to go. They either left the state entirely or they did the only thing there was to do. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2870.1s)]
*  And so as the same New York newspaper editorial read, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2879.62s)]
*  watching the mines creep nearer and nearer to their cabins, residents have looked with foreboding at first [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2886.42s)]
*  and then realizing the futility of any efforts to stand aside. They've shouldered picks and entered [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2892.98s)]
*  the mouths of the black tunnels. One of the men who followed that path was named Frank Keeney. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2899.78s)]
*  Frank Keeney's family had hunted and farmed the hills of Clay County, West Virginia, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2909.86s)]
*  for a hundred years when they got word that mining and lumber companies had claimed ownership of [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2915.46s)]
*  their land. They lost their land and some of the family was able to find farmland some distance [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2921.14s)]
*  away and went there to set up until the corporations came for them as well. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2928.66s)]
*  Others went to work for the timber companies that had taken their land from them because they didn't [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2933.3s)]
*  know what else to do. Some of them, Frank Keeney's parents, moved down to Conawa County [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2937.54s)]
*  to a place called Cabin Creek and they became coal miners there. This is the story of, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2946.82s)]
*  I would say, a lot of people, you know, just about everybody up in those hills. That's their story [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2956.02s)]
*  in the late 18 and early 1900s. In Conawa County, Frank Keeney was born there. All this happened [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2963.7s)]
*  two years before he was born and so two years after his family gets to Conawa, he's born and [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2971.94s)]
*  by the time he was a boy, he could climb to the top of the highest mountain and look around in all [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2977.14s)]
*  he would lay his eyes on were coal mines as far as the eye could see. In the earlier quote from [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2985.14s)]
*  Altina Waller's book, she mentioned that at the time of the Civil War, virtually everybody [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2992.5s)]
*  in these southern counties lived on a self-sufficient farm that either they or [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=2998.42s)]
*  their family owned. Just like that. I mean just like that. In the blink of an eye, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3002.58s)]
*  the length of one boy's short childhood, that number was down from virtually everybody to [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3008.7400000000002s)]
*  single digits. The companies owned everything. They owned all the land. They owned the roads [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3014.26s)]
*  that came in and out and moved around within the land. They began importing workers but there was [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3026.0200000000004s)]
*  nowhere for them to live and so the companies built houses and they owned all the houses [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3032.6600000000003s)]
*  and they took the rent out of the miners' paychecks. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3037.78s)]
*  The workers and their families needed food and they needed supplies for daily life. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3040.66s)]
*  There wasn't any market infrastructure for that so the company built and stocked up a store [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3045.94s)]
*  and deducted what the miners owed to it from their paychecks. The company didn't provide anything [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3051.46s)]
*  to the miners for work. They didn't provide boots. They didn't provide helmets. They didn't provide [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3058.82s)]
*  they didn't provide picks or shovels or any other tools or supplies that the miners needed to [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3064.9s)]
*  actually mine the coal. The miners had to buy all of that themselves from the company store [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3070.9s)]
*  just to work in the mines. They had to pay the company to sharpen their tools. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3076.5s)]
*  The miners even had to buy the explosives that they used to break apart the earth from the company [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3082.34s)]
*  store of the company that they were digging coal for. Well since many of the miners were destitute [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3087.94s)]
*  immigrants or former black sharecroppers or just penniless locals they had to go into debt [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3093.78s)]
*  to the company store just to get started on their first day as a miner and the company made sure [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3102.1000000000004s)]
*  that many of them never ever got back to even. The law said that children had to go to school [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3108.98s)]
*  and so the company built the school and hired the teachers. The company controlled the curriculum to [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3117.54s)]
*  prepare the miners children for their own graduation into the life of a miner. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3125.46s)]
*  School only went up to eighth grade in most places. There was no high school [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3131.54s)]
*  because after that the boys were expected to be up on the mountain working as trapper boys opening [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3135.86s)]
*  and closing the mines air vents or in some other capacity to prepare them for that life. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3140.98s)]
*  The company owned the church and hired the minister. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3147.54s)]
*  His sermons were monitored and were expected to reinforce company policy. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3153.86s)]
*  Many of the ministers provided regular reports on what the miners were saying and thinking. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3159.62s)]
*  In fact company teachers, doctors, store clerks, saloon keepers, preachers, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3166.7400000000002s)]
*  preachers, all the company employees who were not miners they formed a separate class [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3174.02s)]
*  above the miners. They were company people. The miners were a liquid labor force that could come [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3183.7s)]
*  and go and every single one of them was replaceable and so the company men, the teachers, doctors, etc [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3190.58s)]
*  were all expected as part of their job description to act as company spies and report on the words [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3198.82s)]
*  and the activities of the miners. Well so many workers coming in from all walks of life [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3204.82s)]
*  speaking any number of languages most of them young single men. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3212.82s)]
*  You know it was a that's a environment asking for a little bit of disorderliness and so someone had [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3220.7400000000002s)]
*  to keep order and so the company paid the police force. They bought the police force [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3228.1800000000003s)]
*  either by hiring and arming sheriff's deputies or by bringing in private mercenaries that they called [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3233.6200000000003s)]
*  mine guards. The mine guards came from the Baldwin-Felts detective agency which sounds like [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3239.2200000000003s)]
*  some kind of Sherlock Holmes outfit. It ain't that. Like the Pinkerton detective agency and other [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3248.7400000000002s)]
*  less notorious ones from the 19th and 20th century. Baldwin-Felts was more like a domestic version of [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3255.86s)]
*  Blackwater. You know the private military company we put to use in Afghanistan and Iraq and their [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3263.78s)]
*  primary purpose from the steel mills of Pennsylvania to the factories of Chicago and the mines of West [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3270.58s)]
*  Virginia and Colorado and Montana and all the rest of the country their purpose was to make sure that [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3277.94s)]
*  no one mentioned the words labor union in the same sentence. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3283.06s)]
*  In 1892 Pinkerton's and if you don't know about them you will before this series is over. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3290.58s)]
*  As an American you should spit whenever you say that name. In 1892 Pinkerton's opened fire on a [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3297.86s)]
*  crowd of people during the homestead strike at Andrew Carnegie steel mill killed and wounded [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3304.02s)]
*  more than a dozen people. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3310.2599999999998s)]
*  The journalist I was just quoting he toured many of these company towns and he provided a [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3314.5s)]
*  maybe surface level outsider's account but it's an insightful one. One that bears insight into the [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3320.66s)]
*  effects that this kind of life can have on the people who live it. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3326.8199999999997s)]
*  I just want to drive that home again I'm sorry to interrupt but this all happened less than 20 years. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3333.54s)]
*  Just imagine the level of transformation we're talking about here. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3342.34s)]
*  The world was a lonely settlers hut around the slope of an inhospitable mountain. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3363.54s)]
*  Bears lumbered through the wilderness and wild cats howled at night. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3369.86s)]
*  No railroad had yet penetrated the region. People lived in small groups here and there in the valleys. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3374.26s)]
*  Life on the whole was simple and devoted chiefly to agriculture. The earth reposed peacefully. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3381.86s)]
*  As you ride up the valley of the guayandot river or through mcdowell mingo and other counties [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3388.7400000000002s)]
*  where the hills stood in untouched quietness two decades ago. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3397.5400000000004s)]
*  Evidences of the transformation are on every hand. The houses of those who work in the mines [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3401.78s)]
*  are never out of sight. Large mouths gape blackly at you from the hillsides. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3407.5400000000004s)]
*  Gaunt tipples head houses and other buildings stare at you from the slopes of the mountains. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3413.86s)]
*  Railroads send their sightings in many directions. Long lines of squat mine cars [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3420.02s)]
*  run along their narrow gauge tracks and disappear around the curves of the hills. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3425.06s)]
*  The earth is scraped and ugly. The blackness of coal is over everything [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3429.86s)]
*  and mounds of fine coal stand about. Peacefulness and quiet have departed. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3436.7400000000002s)]
*  And let us see what kind of civilization has resulted. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3443.86s)]
*  The typical coal mining town is not a town in the ordinary sense at all. The place where the town [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3447.94s)]
*  stands is the point at which a seam has been opened, buildings have been erected, and machinery [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3454.42s)]
*  has been installed. The dwellings that cluster about the tipple or straggle along the bed of [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3459.7000000000003s)]
*  the creek are not occupied by self-dependent citizens of a community which gives many [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3464.6600000000003s)]
*  opportunities for employment and presents a variety of facets to the world at large. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3469.86s)]
*  They are occupied solely by the men who work in the mines. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3475.1400000000003s)]
*  The town is the adjunct and necessary convenience of an industry. If the mines should disappear, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3479.54s)]
*  it too would cease to exist. It is not even called a town in the language of the locality. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3486.42s)]
*  It is called a camp. No one owns his own house. He cannot acquire so much title the property. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3492.82s)]
*  No one runs a store, operates a garage, or sells groceries or haberdashery to his fellow townsmen. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3500.5s)]
*  No one amuses them in a movie theater. There is no main street of small independent businesses [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3506.98s)]
*  owned by different people and making up that mosaic of commercial life that is typical of [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3512.6600000000003s)]
*  villages everywhere. There is little, if any, participation in common group activities. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3517.1400000000003s)]
*  No body of elected councilman ever passes on repairs for roads. No group of people ever gets [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3523.94s)]
*  together and decides that the old schoolhouse is too ramshackle for the children or that the old [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3529.46s)]
*  church needs repainting. No family physician builds up a successful practice by competing [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3534.1800000000003s)]
*  with other physicians. No lawyer settles disputes over property rights among his neighbors. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3539.46s)]
*  It is not accurate to say that no one does these things. The coal company does them all. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3547.38s)]
*  It owns all the houses and rents them to the miner. Even in the more enlightened company towns, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3554.42s)]
*  the company owns the store, the pool room, the movie theater, the school, and the church. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3559.94s)]
*  The company employs the physicians and collects a small monthly sum from each miner to help pay him. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3565.38s)]
*  The company owns all the land and everything upon it. It therefore controls the life and [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3571.06s)]
*  activities of the little community. It is responsible for the sanitation. The company's [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3575.94s)]
*  ownership sometimes extends to the roads so that it can control ingress and egress. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3581.3s)]
*  In some counties, the company is the employer of the deputy sheriffs and is therefore responsible [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3586.7400000000002s)]
*  for police supervision. In Logan County, the mine operators paid out $61,000 last year in salaries [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3591.7000000000003s)]
*  for deputy sheriffs. Miners in West Virginia are not paid as workers elsewhere are paid. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3598.9s)]
*  They do not receive in cash all that they have earned. On their semi-monthly paydays, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3606.5s)]
*  they are given statements showing how much they owe the company and how much the company owes them. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3611.2999999999997s)]
*  Among the items charged against them in this account is the indebtedness incurred at the [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3616.42s)]
*  company store. Other items are rent for their houses, lighting, heating, doctor's services, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3620.2599999999998s)]
*  use of a hospital, and even the sharpening of tools and the use of a company wash house in [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3626.66s)]
*  which to clean up after a day's work. The law of West Virginia prohibits companies from issuing [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3632.1s)]
*  scrip and payment of wages, specifying that if such scrip is issued, it shall be held to be a [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3637.86s)]
*  promised to pay the sum specified therein in lawful money. But the law is never enforced, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3643.94s)]
*  and the companies generally issue the scrip. I'll read one last paragraph here from this. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3649.54s)]
*  This is from Winthrop D. Lane about 100 years ago in the New York publication called Survey. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3657.06s)]
*  This is an important part. That's why I broke here. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3663.06s)]
*  What began as a means of taking care of the emergent needs of workers became a settled [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3667.22s)]
*  condition everywhere. Today, 400,000 men, women, and children in West Virginia are living this [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3674.02s)]
*  subservient existence. They are caught up in a civilization within a civilization, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3682.1s)]
*  an alien order embedded in a democracy. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3689.7000000000003s)]
*  Since the company houses were property, the workers had no right to privacy. They had no [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3700.7400000000002s)]
*  right to personal space. It wasn't their personal or private space. They didn't even have tenants [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3708.1800000000003s)]
*  rights, the kind of thing you would think of normally if you were paying rent on a house. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3713.3s)]
*  You would get certain rights that go with that house. None of that applied. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3717.38s)]
*  The company decided which visitors you were allowed to have. Homes could be searched, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3721.62s)]
*  and were searched, at any time. They could wake you up in the middle of the night, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3726.42s)]
*  march your family out, and go tear your place up if they wanted to without warning [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3730.42s)]
*  the way corrections officers would do a cell inspection. Among the items that were most [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3734.9s)]
*  commonly searched for were any books and pamphlets that were considered contrary to the company's [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3741.38s)]
*  interests because the company decided what books and what newspapers and other media was allowed [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3746.34s)]
*  on its property. Very often the only newspapers allowed were the ones that the coal mine operators [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3751.2200000000003s)]
*  themselves had set up. Anybody found with unauthorized reading material was just fired [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3757.38s)]
*  on the spot. If he had a family, he and his family were given notice to get out of their company [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3763.94s)]
*  house and get out of town. Anybody who was fired was also blacklisted because the coal companies [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3769.3s)]
*  worked together to keep track of people that they considered troublemakers. So a fired worker [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3776.26s)]
*  couldn't just move over to the next mountain or the next coal field. He would find that he was not [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3782.26s)]
*  welcome anywhere. So this destitute worker with no money because he's not paid in cash, he's paid in [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3786.42s)]
*  company script for a company store that he's no longer allowed to use, would take his meager [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3793.1400000000003s)]
*  belongings. You just have to leave the region all together with his family. I mean literally leave [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3799.46s)]
*  the whole region. Ownership of the company store and any saloons or other facilities the miners [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3803.78s)]
*  used would give the company a way to reduce the miners' pay kind of through the back door. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3812.1000000000004s)]
*  They didn't want to cut their wages maybe and start a big fight so they would just raise prices [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3819.0600000000004s)]
*  on the supplies that they sold the miners that they needed to actually go up and mine. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3823.6200000000003s)]
*  They would raise the prices on food or other supplies that they needed at home. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3829.6200000000003s)]
*  Sometimes when the miners would successfully negotiate a pay raise, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3834.7400000000002s)]
*  the coal companies would argue and fight about it and act like they were trying to put it off and [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3841.1400000000003s)]
*  then they would give them a little compromise pay raise and then they would just raise prices in the [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3846.6600000000003s)]
*  company store accordingly to make up for it. Company mine guards would patrol voting stations [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3850.82s)]
*  during elections intimidating workers to make sure they voted the way the company wanted or [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3860.66s)]
*  just not vote at all. Sometimes workers were just handed out ballots from the company that had [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3866.1s)]
*  already been filled out for them. Anybody who was heard promoting political candidates or policies [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3871.94s)]
*  that were not favored by the company was just immediately fired and evicted from the town. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3879.46s)]
*  And so in this way the coal companies with control of this whole population of miners [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3885.46s)]
*  were able to fill up the sheriff's offices, fill up the county courts and other offices, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3890.66s)]
*  even a lot of the state government with its own hired men. When a miner was heard or killed on the [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3895.2999999999997s)]
*  job, the question of whether the mine operator was responsible went before adjudicators who were [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3901.46s)]
*  chosen and paid by the company. When accusations of abuse were made against the mine guards or [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3907.14s)]
*  other company officials, those reports had to be made to sheriffs who were elected and very often [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3913.7s)]
*  simply paid by the company. They were heard by judges who were approved and elected by the company. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3920.42s)]
*  I mean that quite literally. The historian David Allen Corbin writes, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3928.42s)]
*  The Logan County Coal Operators Association formed its police bulwark from a local source. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3933.3s)]
*  It simply hired the county sheriff, Don Chafin, and his deputies. The treasurer of the Logan [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3938.9s)]
*  County Coal Operators Association testified that the association had paid Chafin $2,725 a month to [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3944.58s)]
*  work for it. That is $40,000 a month today. Sheriff Chafin only had an official salary from the [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3952.18s)]
*  department of several hundred dollars a month. I think it was like $365 a month is what he made. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3960.8199999999997s)]
*  And when he was already in his mid-30s, he already reported over a million dollars in assets. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3967.54s)]
*  So it gives you an idea of the scope of this. The deputy sheriffs, like the county sheriff, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3973.38s)]
*  were paid by personal checks from the coal operators. In one year, the association paid out [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3980.1s)]
*  $61,517 to these deputies for protection against the union. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3986.98s)]
*  The anti-union activities of the Logan County sheriffs and his deputies became a national [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3991.94s)]
*  disgrace and part of the region's folklore. Two deputies were stationed at each railroad depot [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=3996.5s)]
*  and on each train to prevent union organizers from entering Logan County. All strangers upon [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4002.34s)]
*  coming into the county were searched and forced to identify themselves. When the clerk for the West [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4008.5s)]
*  Virginia Department of Mines, Toby Heiser, arrived in Logan, he was accosted by several deputies in [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4014.1s)]
*  order to identify himself. He refused to do so, and the deputies dragged him off the train, beat [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4019.94s)]
*  him, and forced him to leave the county. A newspaper reporter from Washington, D.C., [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4025.62s)]
*  after a visit to Logan County wrote, Everywhere one goes down in this county, he hears the name [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4030.98s)]
*  of Don Chafin, High Sheriff of Logan County. One can see that he has struck terror into the hearts [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4036.3399999999997s)]
*  of the people in the union fields. Although a state officer, they do not trust him. Every kind [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4042.5s)]
*  of crime is charged against him and his deputies. He is the king of the kingdom of Logan. He reigns [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4048.42s)]
*  supreme by virtue of a state machine blocked by the power of the operators. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4054.34s)]
*  The American Civil Liberties Union declared that Logan County had become a national scandal, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4060.6600000000003s)]
*  and a U.S. Senate investigating committee denounced the Logan deputy sheriff system as vicious and [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4065.86s)]
*  un-American. They said it was contrary to the genius and spirit of our institutions. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4071.1400000000003s)]
*  A United Mineworkers of America official told the U.S. Senate committee, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4078.6600000000003s)]
*  I would just love to see this committee go down to Logan County without anybody knowing who they [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4082.82s)]
*  were. And Senator Burton K. Wheeler responded, They'd probably throw the Senate committee in jail. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4087.3s)]
*  So that's what's going on. The companies run everything. Everyone works for the company, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4098.66s)]
*  including the government. And most of the company employees who weren't miners were expected to be [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4108.580000000001s)]
*  involved with keeping the miners under control. Again, company teachers, preachers, doctors, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4115.3s)]
*  store clerks, saloon keepers, all those type of employees, they were all expected to act as [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4122.1s)]
*  company spies. The company owned and ran the post office, and all the miners' incoming and [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4127.620000000001s)]
*  out-coming mail was monitored. Anyone heard complaining about any of this was fired, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4135.46s)]
*  and evicted, and blacklisted, and sometimes beaten. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4146.34s)]
*  All of this was done, of course, according to the companies, to protect the miners from the predations [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4152.58s)]
*  of those radicals at the United Mineworkers Union. It had already gotten its claws into the coal [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4158.1s)]
*  fields of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other states. It was even making inroads into the northern parts [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4164.9s)]
*  of West Virginia. But the operators were determined that the union would never, under any circumstances, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4170.74s)]
*  be allowed to infect their coal fields in southern West Virginia. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4179.78s)]
*  Give you some idea of the scope of this thing. You know, everybody can kind of understand when [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4185.7s)]
*  you go to work each day, you're at the store, the office, or wherever it is that you work, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4192.34s)]
*  that the company runs the show. It's their property. It's their rules. But in West Virginia alone, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4197.62s)]
*  the operating coal fields were larger than the states of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4206.26s)]
*  and Delaware combined. And 94% of the miners there lived this way that I'm describing in [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4211.78s)]
*  company towns. So that's an area the size of three states in which the laws and constitution [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4218.5s)]
*  of the United States and the state of West Virginia were not the day-to-day practical ruling authority [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4225.94s)]
*  in which, as Winther Blaine wrote, represented a civilization within a civilization, an alien [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4234.9s)]
*  order embedded in a democracy. It was an industrial dictatorship, like a really a [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4241.7s)]
*  dictatorial government the size of three states in West Virginia alone just planted right here in [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4249.139999999999s)]
*  the middle of America. The president of the American Federation of Labor, Samuel Gompers, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4253.78s)]
*  wrote in 1913, a powerful and subtle conspiracy between organized capital and the governmental [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4263.22s)]
*  agents of the state of West Virginia gives indications of the existence of an invisible [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4270.02s)]
*  government that steals from the workers the liberty they are told they have. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4274.26s)]
*  A U.S. congressman visiting the coal fields from Wisconsin said, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4279.620000000001s)]
*  one cannot imagine the power of the mining companies. It elects senators and judges. It [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4284.26s)]
*  owns both the Republican and Democratic parties in a state. All laws are made to suit the mine owners. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4290.740000000001s)]
*  All the judges are elected through their influence, even up to the judges of the state supreme court. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4298.820000000001s)]
*  Maybe the thing that gets me more than just about anything in this whole story, this whole sequence [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4307.38s)]
*  of events, for some reason the one that just gets me the most is that most of these coal operations [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4315.38s)]
*  that exerted so much social and political and economic control over the lives of the people in [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4322.26s)]
*  West Virginia were owned by people who had never set foot in the state, would never set foot in the [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4328.66s)]
*  state. And some were meant owned by men in Charleston, the capital of West Virginia, or other [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4335.3s)]
*  cities closer to home, little towns, but most were not. Most were owned by out-of-state interests, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4342.34s)]
*  big out-of-state corporate interests. J.P. Morgan's U.S. Steel Company owned or operated 150,000 acres [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4348.42s)]
*  in West Virginia. The Norfolk and Western Railway conglomerate ran the Pocahontas Coal and Coat [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4356.5s)]
*  Company, owned just about all of it. At the time of purchase in 1902, I think, it was about 300,000 [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4363.139999999999s)]
*  acres. Those are just two, there's many more like that. Giant, distant corporations. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4369.94s)]
*  Owning a chunk of a U.S. state the size of, you know, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Massachusetts, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4378.099999999999s)]
*  and running them as dictatorships and police states, really. It comes to very much resemble, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4389.3s)]
*  actually very much resemble, the economic relationship between the core and the periphery [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4397.46s)]
*  under colonialism, under traditional colonialism. West Virginia had essentially been reduced to an [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4403.22s)]
*  economic colony of Wall Street and other out-of-state financiers and corporations. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4411.06s)]
*  It really, really does resemble that system. Under colonialism, the colonies had two primary [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4417.860000000001s)]
*  economic roles. They were to provide cheap labor to extract natural resources. They would then be [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4423.7s)]
*  shipped back to the mother country, and then the mother country would use those natural resources [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4430.98s)]
*  to manufacture the higher value added finished products for which the colony then served as a [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4436.5s)]
*  market. That was its secondary function. And in that system, the colonies would be forbidden or [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4442.259999999999s)]
*  prevented from using the resources that they extract to create higher-end finished products [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4450.66s)]
*  themselves. They performed the low-end work of resource extraction so that the imperial core [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4456.74s)]
*  could profit from the manufacturing part. Actual ownership of all the resources remains with the [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4464.0199999999995s)]
*  core. The people in the place where the resources are extracted, they might receive wages, but not [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4471.94s)]
*  profits. It's a system that prevents the colonized territories from ever truly developing [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4480.74s)]
*  economically. It's actually designed to prevent that because a colony is not perceived [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4489.46s)]
*  by the core as a society. It's perceived as an operation. As one of the quotes said, it's an [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4497.86s)]
*  appendage to an industrial operation. And so things like economic development or these things [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4505.14s)]
*  just don't play a role. It's not a society. The fact that children are born and families live their [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4512.34s)]
*  whole lives there for multiple generations, it's all incidental. The miners were viewed as a liquid [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4519.14s)]
*  commodity, fungible labor, easily replaceable, faceless people. You just could be swapped out [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4527.7s)]
*  with the next batch of clueless immigrants that just arrived, desperate and hungry from central [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4537.3s)]
*  or eastern Europe. More than one person over the years has expressed in one way or another [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4541.38s)]
*  bewilderment or outrage that industrial civilization at the time ran on coal. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4550.58s)]
*  Coal heated virtually all the homes and businesses around the country. It powered the country's [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4559.46s)]
*  railroads and its power grids through coal-fired power plants. Even the U.S. Navy ran on coal. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4566.26s)]
*  And so if you were an alien from Mars who was coming and hovering over the planet Earth and [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4574.820000000001s)]
*  looking down and seeing a whole civilization that runs on this one precious resource, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4578.740000000001s)]
*  you could be forgiven for thinking that the people who lived where those resources were and dug out [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4586.1s)]
*  of the ground were probably some of the richest people on the planet. But in fact, they were [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4590.66s)]
*  poor as dirt and living under, I mean, honestly what approached slave-like conditions in many ways. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4596.74s)]
*  It's taken on different guises over the years from direct conquest and enslavement of the [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4608.9s)]
*  natives like in the early days of New World colonization to the more familiar style mastered [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4615.139999999999s)]
*  by the Dutch and the British and against which the American colonies fought a violent rebellion. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4620.66s)]
*  You know, all of this core periphery stuff I'm talking about, it's all in the Declaration of [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4626.26s)]
*  Independence all the way up to the more modern post-World War II version where, you know, I [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4629.62s)]
*  don't know, the CIA overthrows a populist leader in Africa and replaces him with a dictator who [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4636.74s)]
*  gives good terms to Exxon Mobil and then uses the money from that to kill his challengers and stuff [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4642.34s)]
*  is Swiss bank account, you know, modern colonialism. Well nowadays we usually think [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4648.42s)]
*  colonialism and we think of the traditional terms of European imperialists colonizing less [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4653.7s)]
*  developed countries in the global south but in very large countries, you know, there's a reason [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4658.9800000000005s)]
*  that a country like the Netherlands or a country like England did that because they didn't have a [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4663.9400000000005s)]
*  lot of land. They wanted to open new markets or develop more resources, they had to go do it [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4668.74s)]
*  somewhere else. But in very large countries like the United States, like Russia, like China, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4674.82s)]
*  you often see similar dynamics, I mean really similar dynamics that emerge within the borders [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4683.139999999999s)]
*  of the country itself. If internal colonialism, internally colonized populations. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4689.62s)]
*  And so again to repeat this point one more time because I really want to drill it in there, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4699.38s)]
*  the hills of southern West Virginia over the course of about 20 years [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4705.219999999999s)]
*  were transformed by outside financial interests from a society of self-sufficient [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4711.54s)]
*  yeoman farmers into an economic colony wholly owned by faraway corporations. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4720.66s)]
*  It all happened more quickly than the people affected by it could react. Before they were [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4729.219999999999s)]
*  able to wrap their heads around what was happening, it had already happened. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4734.34s)]
*  The communities that used to exist there were completely shattered by the transformation. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4740.18s)]
*  It wasn't an easy task to rebuild any kind of community under conditions where [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4745.78s)]
*  people spoke a dozen or more languages and where the coal companies were suspicious of [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4751.06s)]
*  any collective activity on the part of their miners. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4755.9400000000005s)]
*  The power of the operators depended on their ability to negotiate as a monolith with miners [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4758.34s)]
*  who could only negotiate as individuals. Every individual miner is immediately replaceable. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4765.9400000000005s)]
*  You'd be the best coal miner in the whole wide world and they could replace you with a guy who's [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4775.38s)]
*  just learning the job and the whole operation is not going to be affected one percent. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4781.22s)]
*  And so no matter who you are, Mr. Miner Man, if you don't like the working conditions, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4786.66s)]
*  or you don't like the pay, you don't like the attitude of the mine guards or the rules in the [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4792.099999999999s)]
*  company town, no problem. There are thousands of other people who can be plugged into your slot. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4796.58s)]
*  The only way that the miners could ever hope to meet on something like equal terms [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4805.38s)]
*  hope to meet on something like equal terms, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4812.66s)]
*  really meet with the men who ran these companies as fellow human beings, was to do it together. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4816.82s)]
*  Because a miner is easily replaceable, but the miners are not replaceable. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4825.46s)]
*  The United Mine Workers of America, our branch of the international union, was founded in Ohio [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4834.18s)]
*  in 1890 and right away began making inroads into coal fields in the Midwest. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4841.54s)]
*  During the business depression of 1894, operators pretty much everywhere started cutting the pay of [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4848.1s)]
*  their miners without warning or negotiation and so the UMW called for a nationwide strike. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4855.94s)]
*  It's their first major strike that they had called for. There were a lot of British and German miners [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4861.7s)]
*  up in the Midwest and these men understood the goals and purpose of a labor union and so the [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4867.54s)]
*  Midwestern coal miners walked off the job. But the coal fields of southern West Virginia, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4874.26s)]
*  places only very recently developed and built up, you know there were some of the last ones to be [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4881.78s)]
*  built up, they were worked by locals or recently arrived central and southern Europeans and [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4886.34s)]
*  southern blacks who had no union experience whatsoever and so they didn't walk out and they [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4894.1s)]
*  kept working and so as all those mines up in the Midwest and the northern areas shut down, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4900.18s)]
*  the ones in southern West Virginia kept going and as a result business from those striking [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4906.1s)]
*  Midwestern coal fields was taken up by the non-union West Virginia mining operations. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4911.06s)]
*  Did a lot of damage to those Midwestern coal companies and it completely failed to get the [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4918.26s)]
*  UMW anything that they had wanted and eventually the operators up there just came to them and said [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4922.74s)]
*  look we're we're gonna all go bankrupt here if you keep this up because there's this other region [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4928.34s)]
*  down here that's just taking all the business and so the UMW just had to call it off. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4933.54s)]
*  Well after operators continued to cut wages, three years later the UMW called another strike. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4939.94s)]
*  This time 1897 and this time they were better prepared and met with unprecedented success in [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4947.46s)]
*  coal fields everywhere in the country. Tens of thousands of union and non-union miners walked off [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4958.34s)]
*  the job en masse everywhere in the country that is except for southern West Virginia and so labor [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4965.0599999999995s)]
*  organizers from all over the United States pour into West Virginia to get these miners there [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4975.06s)]
*  organized, explain to them what a union is and what it's for and why they need one and [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4979.46s)]
*  just to get them organized. Samuel Gompers, the head of the AFL, he came in and he said the success [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4984.660000000001s)]
*  of this strike depends, this is a nationwide strike, he said it depends on one factor [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4991.14s)]
*  that the miners of West Virginia will suspend operations. Gompers was joined by a whole bunch [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=4995.620000000001s)]
*  of well-known labor activists at the time. Eugene Debs was there, a whole bunch of people [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5002.5s)]
*  but the coal companies in West Virginia were very well prepared. Company police and mine guards [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5009.62s)]
*  rode the trains and patrolled the train stations. They turned back any labor organizer that tried [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5015.38s)]
*  to enter into those southern counties, not just onto their property by the way but into the counties [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5020.34s)]
*  period. The organizers who got through anyway and were discovered were thrown in jail, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5025.62s)]
*  they were fined, very often they were beaten, sometimes they were shot at by company guards or [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5034.42s)]
*  police. John Mitchell who was vice president to the United Mine Workers of America at the time, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5040.66s)]
*  he was chased and shot at by company guards, had to flee for his life by swimming across a mountain [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5048.5s)]
*  stream. The operators went to their pet judges and got rubber-stamping junctions against the [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5052.98s)]
*  labor organizations, ordering them to cease all efforts to organize the miners of West Virginia. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5059.54s)]
*  The state very quickly became a focal point of the whole nationwide labor movement. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5067.0599999999995s)]
*  The AFL, the Knights of Labor, the UMWA, 28 other national and international unions sent [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5072.58s)]
*  representatives to convene a council in Wheeling, West Virginia to try to coordinate and publicize [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5078.58s)]
*  their efforts. Mass meetings were held all over the country by workers to express indignation at [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5084.42s)]
*  the court's interference with the constitutional rights of the organizers and miners in West [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5090.42s)]
*  Virginia. Still, southern West Virginia was impenetrable to the union. One organizer [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5094.74s)]
*  reported that he'd managed to establish a local at a mine in McDowell County, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5104.58s)]
*  but that it soon dissolved because the miners there were unwilling to participate for fear of [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5109.22s)]
*  being fired, evicted, and blacklisted. David Allen Corbin in his great study, it's called Life, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5113.62s)]
*  Work, and Rebellion in the Coalfields, the West Virginia Miners, 1880 to 1922 by David Allen [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5120.5s)]
*  Corbin, great book, he writes, the miners knew their operators. When local unions were formed [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5126.26s)]
*  and miners took offices in the locals, the coal companies reacted swiftly and harshly. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5134.02s)]
*  The truth is, an organizer wrote, that as fast as men organize, the companies are discharging them [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5139.22s)]
*  and turning them out of their houses. The coal companies also reacted against the organizers [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5144.820000000001s)]
*  when they became successful. Most of the organizers were threatened, some of them were beaten, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5150.18s)]
*  and nearly all of them had their efforts halted by injunctions or were jailed, often on charges [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5155.38s)]
*  such as holding meetings on Sunday and thereby violating the Sabbath. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5160.5s)]
*  Well, despite all that, the strike overall was still a huge success. Membership in the UMWA [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5167.46s)]
*  increased tenfold and the union dues from that refilled the union's empty treasury and gave them [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5175.7s)]
*  a sense of confidence going forward into the future because for the first time, miners' solidarity [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5181.46s)]
*  had been put on display in large sections of the country. The operators' associations up in Ohio, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5187.94s)]
*  and Illinois, Indiana, and Western Pennsylvania, great big giant coal field called the Central [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5196.74s)]
*  Field up there, finally broke with precedent and agreed to sit down and negotiate with United Mine [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5201.86s)]
*  Workers regarding wages and working conditions. The result was the Central Competitive Field [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5208.0199999999995s)]
*  Agreement, which made the unionization of the Midwestern Coalfields official. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5213.62s)]
*  It recognized the UMWA as the miners' instrument for collective bargaining. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5221.0599999999995s)]
*  The wage increases and other accommodations were really secondary to getting their union recognized. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5226.74s)]
*  So without a union, wage increases and other accommodations can always be rolled back tomorrow. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5233.94s)]
*  You need a union. Now critically, those Midwestern coal companies that made this agreement, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5238.900000000001s)]
*  they extracted a very important promise from the United Mine Workers of America. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5247.7s)]
*  They told them that the concessions they were making in the agreement were going to drive up [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5253.9400000000005s)]
*  their operating costs and would allow the non-union fields to the south in West Virginia to [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5260.1s)]
*  undercut and outcompete them like they had before. And so as part of the agreement, [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5267.780000000001s)]
*  the United Mine Workers committed themselves to unionizing southern West Virginia come hell or [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5274.26s)]
*  high water. And the coal companies there, though, were not going to observe any limits to prevent [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5280.660000000001s)]
*  that from happening. As far as the coal companies of southern West Virginia were concerned, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5287.62s)]
*  a unionized workforce was a threat to their very existence. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5297.3s)]
*  The coal fields in West Virginia were further away from the major coal consuming regions on [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5302.98s)]
*  the eastern seaboard or the Great Lakes or even the Mississippi Valley. West Virginia didn't really [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5308.9s)]
*  consume a lot of coal, so it all had to be sold out of state for the most part, whereas the coal [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5316.18s)]
*  fields in Ohio and Pennsylvania, they sold a lot of coal to their own states very short distance [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5320.58s)]
*  away, which meant that the transportation costs for them were a lot lower. So the built-in costs [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5326.42s)]
*  in West Virginia were going to be higher. And the only lever that they had to keep themselves [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5331.22s)]
*  competitive was wages. The cost of extracting the coal was the labor to do it was the only other [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5337.3s)]
*  major cost besides transportation. And since their transport costs were higher, there was just a [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5344.02s)]
*  constant downward pressure on the wages of West Virginia miners. A lot of corner cutting and a lot [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5349.14s)]
*  of things that became more advanced in the northern mines as far as safety and things like that that [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5354.660000000001s)]
*  didn't make it to the southern mines in West Virginia because they cost money. And so as a result, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5361.620000000001s)]
*  the West Virginia mines were the most dangerous in the country. The West Virginia mine operators [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5366.740000000001s)]
*  they actually they were really paranoid. They actually saw the United Mine Workers of America [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5374.82s)]
*  as a tool that was being used against them like in a conspiracy. They really believed that this was [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5380.5s)]
*  happening to like buy the Midwestern coal companies to try to cripple their operations and steal their [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5386.0199999999995s)]
*  business. That's what they thought. So they were determined to keep the union out at all costs. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5391.86s)]
*  As far as the union was concerned, southern West Virginia mines had to be unionized or else they [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5398.0199999999995s)]
*  would always and forever make it mathematically untenable for other mines around the country to [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5403.86s)]
*  accept the union to irreconcilable positions. The UMWA had not made headway into southern West [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5408.74s)]
*  Virginia so far and part of that was because of the efforts of the coal mine operators. But a big [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5419.94s)]
*  part of it had to do with the fact that they had so far consistently failed to understand [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5427.62s)]
*  or really address the concerns of the West Virginia miners which were different from [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5433.38s)]
*  people in other parts of the country. Whether it was because the immigrant black and local miners [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5437.62s)]
*  were kind of accustomed to being poor and were isolated from the temptations of civilization, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5445.7s)]
*  maybe it was that or maybe it was because a portion of the miners saw the job as a part-time [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5452.42s)]
*  supplement to a mixed lifestyle that included hunting and fishing and small-scale gardening. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5457.78s)]
*  Whatever the reason was, the miners in southern Appalachia were simply not that concerned about [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5464.179999999999s)]
*  how much they were being paid. Not that they didn't care at all, it just was not a priority. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5469.94s)]
*  Negotiating higher wages was how the union sold itself to miners everywhere else. It's how it [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5476.42s)]
*  tried to sell itself to the West Virginians but for the most part they were not receptive. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5481.94s)]
*  It took the UMWA a long time to figure out that the highest priority in West Virginia, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5487.94s)]
*  the central issue for the miners of West Virginia, was the oppressive conditions [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5495.62s)]
*  of the company town and especially, especially the abuses of the private security forces hired [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5502.58s)]
*  by the companies. That's what they wanted help with. The UMWA didn't really get this at first [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5509.0599999999995s)]
*  and so it hindered their organizing efforts but they were soon to learn the hard way just what [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5516.5s)]
*  the miners of southern West Virginia had been dealing with. Corbin writes, quote, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5521.86s)]
*  the coal operators were determined to prevent the UMWA from again invading the state, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5527.3s)]
*  believing as did Justin Collins that if the coal operator undertakes to fight the union, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5532.74s)]
*  he will have to fight force with force. More and more operators formed police barricades against [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5538.02s)]
*  these invaders by hiring mercenaries from the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency. By 1910, [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5543.54s)]
*  Baldwin-Felts guards could be found in nearly every company town in southern West Virginia. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5549.62s)]
*  The principal work of these guards, according to the head of the agency, Tom Felts, was to protect [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5554.66s)]
*  the operators against organized labor. In protecting the coal establishment from union agitators, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5559.94s)]
*  the Baldwin-Felts guards were effective and brutal whereas in earlier years, during quiet periods, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5566.5s)]
*  national organizers moved relatively unmolested around the state. By 1907, they were surrounded [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5572.74s)]
*  and harassed by Baldwin-Felts guards from the time they boarded a train in Cincinnati headed [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5579.0599999999995s)]
*  for West Virginia. The arrival of UMWA organizers often meant headlines for local labor newspapers. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5584.0199999999995s)]
*  The February 10, 1910 issue of the Labor Argus read, horrible butchery of representatives of [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5592.0199999999995s)]
*  United Mine Workers by brutal and bloodthirsty guards in the New River Field. The September 8, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5598.18s)]
*  1910 edition of the paper headlined, guards brutally assault union men, two members of [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5604.42s)]
*  the International Executive Board of United Mine Workers of America beaten up by coal company thugs. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5610.42s)]
*  The United Mine Workers Journal stigmatized West Virginia as the black belt, clarifying, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5617.38s)]
*  we do not mean that they employ nothing but colored men, but that it is a region where it [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5622.900000000001s)]
*  is not safe for an organizer to let his business be known. By 1912, UMWA officials openly admitted [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5627.06s)]
*  that they no longer encouraged organizers to enter the state of West Virginia because of the danger [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5634.5s)]
*  posed by the Baldwin-Felts guards. The vigilance of the Baldwin-Felts guards against union agitators [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5640.18s)]
*  carried over into the everyday internal affairs of the company town. If a miner showed too much [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5646.580000000001s)]
*  independence or became inquisitive or complained, he was suspected of being a union agitator and [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5652.42s)]
*  might be beaten and driven out of town. The guards forcibly prohibited the assembly of more than three [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5658.02s)]
*  miners at night, a practice they called bunching for fear that one of the miners might be an [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5664.18s)]
*  organizer preaching unionism. Describing the guards' activities, a miner recollected, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5669.3s)]
*  they rode horses and wouldn't let anyone they didn't like walk on the railroad tracks. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5675.54s)]
*  Worse though, you couldn't go into the office and tell about mistakes or complain about the store. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5680.1s)]
*  The guards would just kick you off the porch. These guards gained a national reputation for [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5684.900000000001s)]
*  their beating, maiming, and murdering of union miners and organizers. In fact, Edward Levinson [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5690.9800000000005s)]
*  in his book, I Break Strikes, a general study of industrial spy and strike breaking agencies [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5697.14s)]
*  throughout the United States, awarded the Baldwin-Felts agency the blue ribbon for wanton, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5702.820000000001s)]
*  cold-blooded murders. Miners throughout the country reported that they were appalled by the [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5708.66s)]
*  activities of the Baldwin-Felts guards in West Virginia, and they made it known that they would [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5714.26s)]
*  not permit themselves to be subjugated in such a manner. Indeed, in the speech that precipitated [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5719.3s)]
*  the massacre by miners of 19 mine guards at Heron, Illinois, a miner had declared, [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5725.38s)]
*  We must show the world that this ain't West Virginia. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5731.78s)]
*  The southern West Virginia miners hated the Baldwin-Felts guards more than did any other [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5737.46s)]
*  group of miners. During one strike, when the miners finally unleashed their wrath against these guards, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5742.099999999999s)]
*  a miner told a journalist, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5748.26s)]
*  End quote. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5761.94s)]
*  Story gets me worked up, guys. Take a breath here and settle down a little bit. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5766.82s)]
*  All right. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5774.9s)]
*  So it took until 1912 for the coal miners of southern West Virginia to finally rise up. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5779.22s)]
*  In the end, it was the very measures the coal companies took to prevent that from happening [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5787.14s)]
*  that ended up ensuring that it did happen. The West Virginia miners had shown little interest [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5792.740000000001s)]
*  in striking for higher wages or better working conditions, very little interest in the union, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5799.54s)]
*  but the paranoid operators used subversion and brute force just to make sure, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5804.660000000001s)]
*  and that was what drove the miners to rebellion. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5809.38s)]
*  Began at a place called Paint Creek in Conowah County. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5812.34s)]
*  Miners there at Paint Creek had been some of the few in southern West Virginia who had managed to [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5819.14s)]
*  negotiate a collective agreement with their operators, but on March 31st, 1912, that contract [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5824.1s)]
*  expired and negotiations between the miners and the Conowah Coal Operators Association began. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5830.9800000000005s)]
*  The miners were asking for a pay raise of two and a half cents per ton of coal dug. Miners, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5838.18s)]
*  by and large, were not paid by the hour. They were paid according to how much coal they delivered, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5843.22s)]
*  and the miners also demanded recognition of their union, of their right to bargain collectively. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5848.66s)]
*  But the operators refused. They said they couldn't remain profitable if they accommodated [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5856.1s)]
*  the coal. They said they were not going to be able to do that. They said they were going to [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5860.740000000001s)]
*  remain profitable if they accommodated that two and a half cent pay raise. So the miners [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5866.18s)]
*  compromised. They said, okay, fine, we'll accept another contract on the existing pay scale, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5870.58s)]
*  just accept our union. And still the operators refused. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5875.860000000001s)]
*  And so the miners cleaned up their work areas and walked off the job on April 19th, 1912. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5881.38s)]
*  Well, soon the more skittish operators worried about maintaining their downstream relationships, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5889.06s)]
*  hurried back to the table and agreed to concessions. And their mines were opened up [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5895.7s)]
*  again by early May. That was in much of Conowah County, but the operators at Paint Creek refused [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5899.54s)]
*  to compromise and instead imported 300 Baldwin-Feltz mine guards to watch over their property and be [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5906.5s)]
*  their enforcers. The guards, well, they did what they knew how to do. From Corbin, quote, [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5913.78s)]
*  the Baldwin-Feltz guards built iron and concrete forts that they equipped with machine guns [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5922.74s)]
*  throughout the strike districts, then evicted striking miners from their company houses, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5928.099999999999s)]
*  destroying $40,000 worth of miners' furniture in the process. The guards then began to intimidate [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5933.0599999999995s)]
*  the strikers in their tent colonies at Holly Grove and Eskdale. The guards often prevented [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5940.0199999999995s)]
*  the strikers from leaving their tent colonies and prohibited them use of company-owned bridges, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5945.299999999999s)]
*  forcing the strikers and their families at gunpoint to wade through waist-high streams. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5950.66s)]
*  They also stopped the strikers and their families from using the passenger trains into Charleston. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5957.3s)]
*  The son of a miner who attempted to do so was kicked in the face and warned, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5962.42s)]
*  get off, you damn son of a bitch, or I will shoot your brains out. He was then literally [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5966.34s)]
*  thrown off the train. The mine guards also began to kill the striking miners, both individually, [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5971.46s)]
*  for example, a black miner chasing his stray cow, and collectively. On June 5, the guards [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5977.94s)]
*  launched a surprise attack on one of the tent colonies, wounding several people. Thereafter, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5984.5s)]
*  according to a local union leader, every day or two they would sneak into the hills and sprinkle [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5990.179999999999s)]
*  the canvas tent cities with showers of lead and pellets, caring not if their bullets hit men, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=5995.299999999999s)]
*  women, or children. End quote. About two years after this strike, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6000.179999999999s)]
*  mine guards from Baldwin-Felts and the Colorado National Guard, which was being manned and funded [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6007.54s)]
*  by a Rockefeller mining company, indiscriminately attacked a miner's tent city in Ludlow, Colorado, [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6015.22s)]
*  and sprayed it with machine gun fire and then burned it down with people hiding in little pits [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6024.26s)]
*  under the tents from the gunfire. They got burned to death, 20 people, 12 children and two women. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6029.14s)]
*  Some men were massacred in one night. The full story of the Ludlow massacres is in the prologue [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6035.38s)]
*  to this podcast series. The guards were very callous in carrying out the evictions most of [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6042.34s)]
*  the time. It would surprise families in the morning, march them out of their homes at gunpoint [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6050.1s)]
*  if necessary. And one or two would guard the family, while the rest of them carried the [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6055.62s)]
*  family's furniture and their other belongings outside and dumped it by the creek. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6062.34s)]
*  They forced their way into the home of Charlie and Ed Fish and found Ed's wife, Willie Fish, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6068.18s)]
*  holding a sick newborn. They marched her and her newborn outside, deposited the crib along [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6074.1s)]
*  with the rest of the furniture on a wagon out there. They told Willie's sister-in-law that they [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6080.66s)]
*  used to hate doing this kind of work, but chuckled and said they'd gotten used to it. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6086.34s)]
*  On Wednesday, May 29th, 1912, for the first time, the miners struck back. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6092.66s)]
*  That morning, a group of mine guards had poured themselves some coffee and they were walking by [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6104.42s)]
*  the company store to get some breakfast when shots rang out from the nearby hillside. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6109.06s)]
*  They started peppering around them, so they rushed back to their barracks and shots started [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6115.46s)]
*  coming down from another hillside. The guards grabbed their rifles. The shots were hitting the [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6119.06s)]
*  wall of their bunkhouse and started returning fire. Guards in another larger bunkhouse nearby [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6128.02s)]
*  rushed out with weapons and began firing at puffs of smoke on the hillsides. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6133.14s)]
*  The attack was wild and poorly planned and nobody on either side was hit, but the psychological [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6138.42s)]
*  impact was large. The mine guards were shaken by the fact that the miners had actually come at them. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6144.98s)]
*  A swivel-mounted gatling gun was stationed in front of the company store, [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6152.9s)]
*  covering the whole hillside with its field of fire. Next to the machine gun was a giant [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6158.419999999999s)]
*  search light which would sweep the trees and the cabins from dusk till dawn. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6162.9s)]
*  Early the next morning, a guard patrol spotted a group of miners making their way through the [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6169.62s)]
*  woods, took off after them, gunfire going in both directions. It was a group of Italians and one of [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6174.58s)]
*  the miners was shot and killed and the black miner who was just out looking for his cow was also hit. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6181.86s)]
*  The leader of this group of guards who was chasing them up into the hills was a man named Ernest [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6189.54s)]
*  Gaugeau. He was one of the most notorious of all the guards. This is a guy who was a known murderer [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6193.54s)]
*  before he was ever hired to Baldwin-Feldts. He was known by all the paint-treak miners as one of the [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6199.86s)]
*  meanest bullies employed by the company. His posses tearing through the hills, kicking in the doors of [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6206.339999999999s)]
*  cabins looking for miners, any miners they can find really, and they come up on the home of Ed [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6212.66s)]
*  and Charlie Fish who had not been involved in the shooting. Ed was sick in bed, only their wives were there. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6218.58s)]
*  And so Ed's wife, Willie Fish, it's a girl who's just about 18 years old, she remembered what happened. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6225.94s)]
*  Quote, they, meaning the miners, came through my yard jabbering in Italian but I couldn't understand [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6233.299999999999s)]
*  half of what they said. I was telling them to go on and scatter. As quick as I got them out, I turned [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6239.299999999999s)]
*  my chickens out. I had about two or three hundred chickens and put them in the yard so they would [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6245.0599999999995s)]
*  scratch out as much of the tracks as they could. The guards came out and they were all over the place. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6249.78s)]
*  The guards came and asked, how long you been out here? I've been out here about an hour feeding my [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6255.22s)]
*  chickens. They said, have you seen anybody? I said, I haven't seen a soul. I'd look them right in the [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6260.5s)]
*  eye and lie like a sailor. End quote. Then the guards came to the cabin of Tony and Janina Savilla, [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6266.9800000000005s)]
*  another Italian family. Tony was away out of state looking for another job and so Janina and the [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6274.9800000000005s)]
*  children were the only ones there. She remembered what happened. Quote, I heard this shooting and I [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6281.78s)]
*  went to the door to see what was the matter. I saw the guards coming down the hill. Those guards were [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6288.179999999999s)]
*  going into the other neighbor houses there and they began to pick up the men they could find in [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6293.54s)]
*  the houses. They came to our house and they opened the door and then they came in and looked under [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6297.7s)]
*  the bed and on the bed was my baby and it was asleep and I told the guard to let the baby alone. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6302.82s)]
*  They struck me and I fell down and they kicked me in the stomach and they hit me with their fists [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6310.02s)]
*  here. She's pointing to where they hit her and then they knocked me down again. End quote. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6314.740000000001s)]
*  When the guards left Janina Savilla was on her knees weeping and praying that the five-month-old [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6322.18s)]
*  baby in her belly was okay. Six of the Italian miners were rounded up and marched out of the [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6329.14s)]
*  hills at gunpoint. One of them named Frank Rusi was released after a few days and made his way [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6336.98s)]
*  home to take care of his sick and pregnant wife and then 10 days later mine guards broke down his [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6343.7s)]
*  door. He wasn't around. They found the wife there alone pregnant and sick and so she runs to the [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6349.78s)]
*  home of a nearby friend whose husband was the mine foreman while the guards cleaned out her [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6356.179999999999s)]
*  house and dumped everything they had out on out in the dirt and then a few days after that the [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6360.419999999999s)]
*  friend's husband, the one that took her in, the mine foreman, was fired from his job because his [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6365.46s)]
*  wife had held Rusi's wife. Having adopted this strategy of cruel, really cruel brutality against [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6370.18s)]
*  the miners, you know, there was nothing business-like about it. These Baldwin-Felts guys that they would [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6380.18s)]
*  hire, you know, sure some of them would be former cops and maybe those guys would be the leaders [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6386.18s)]
*  that everybody else had to follow but a lot of their ranks were just manned up by thugs from the [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6391.46s)]
*  cities. Guys, I mean, Ernest Gouger was a known murderer and they're hiring him and giving him a [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6397.62s)]
*  gun and saying go up there and throw these people out of their homes. Go do this, go do that. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6403.14s)]
*  You know, these are hard men and they had to be hard men because they're going up there to go [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6407.78s)]
*  against coal miners, to throw them out of their houses and chase them away from the mine. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6411.62s)]
*  The coal miners are tough people and so the guys who got sent up there against them had to be tough [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6417.14s)]
*  people but they weren't always the most savory bunch and there was really a cruel streak to how [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6422.660000000001s)]
*  the operators in southern West Virginia handled these things. And so the company then set about [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6428.9800000000005s)]
*  replacing the miners, started bringing in train loads of scab labor from other parts of the country. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6436.42s)]
*  And this the miners were not prepared to tolerate because that was the one way [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6442.42s)]
*  that they could truly defeat their strike. Now these poor replacement workers, most of these guys [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6446.5s)]
*  had no idea what they were walking into. They were walking into something that was becoming a war zone [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6453.860000000001s)]
*  very quickly. The story of Lawrence O'Brien who was a replacement worker brought in from New York [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6458.66s)]
*  City. His story provides an illustrative example. Lawrence O'Brien's this guy who lives in New York [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6466.34s)]
*  City. He's a skilled machinist. O'Brien gets laid off from his job and he's out looking for work and [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6472.42s)]
*  he sees an ad. They're looking for machinists and boiler makers and other skilled workers [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6480.26s)]
*  to get on a train and go down to West Virginia to work on motors and other gear at the mines. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6484.82s)]
*  He signs up on the spot along with several of his Irish buddies, a whole bunch of Italian and Polish [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6490.259999999999s)]
*  immigrants who literally just got off the boat. I mean they are still trailing their luggage behind [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6499.62s)]
*  them from their trip. They came straight from the docks and they don't even have time to go home for [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6504.9s)]
*  a change of clothing. He calls his wife, tells her that he's found a good job. It's in West Virginia [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6510.58s)]
*  but they pay five dollars a day. He has to leave right now and he'll write for his suitcase when [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6517.22s)]
*  he gets there. So he's on the train. Two hundred other guys. Right away he notices the guards [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6522.02s)]
*  and he thinks, huh that's interesting. No food was served and so when they change trains in Washington [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6530.34s)]
*  he tries to go into the station to buy a sandwich but the guards won't let him leave. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6538.66s)]
*  When they get to the Paint Creek area, guards take out their rifles, start patrolling the cars [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6542.42s)]
*  and they tell everyone, order everyone to pull down the blinds on their windows. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6549.54s)]
*  So Brian's starting to worry maybe he made a little mistake here. The train stops at different [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6555.38s)]
*  mining camps along the way and each time deposits a few workers in the hands of some guards who march [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6560.82s)]
*  them off. When O'Brien and his friends get to their destination they're told that by the [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=6567.7s)]

*  keeney began working in the mine when he was just 12 years old to support his mother and two sisters [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8830.5s)]
*  now he's 30 years old and keeney frank keeney he's an impressive looking guy but he's small and he's [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8835.859999999999s)]
*  supposed to be soft-spoken but quick-tempered and certainly not a man to be trifled with [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8842.9s)]
*  his great-grandson is actually a history professor out in west virginia today [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8850.34s)]
*  last year i was out there in an event when he was present and an older man whose father had known [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8855.06s)]
*  frank keeney gave the introduction to our little event and to the great-grandson he looked at him [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8860.9s)]
*  and he said one of the things he said was when he asked his dad what frank keeney was like [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8869.54s)]
*  that his dad paused for a moment and then just said when he spoke people listened [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8874.980000000001s)]
*  and so that kind of that that stuck with me a little bit because i think that does say a lot [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8882.580000000002s)]
*  without saying very much at all frank keeney had emerged as a leader among the miners because the [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8886.02s)]
*  union was perceived to be moving slowly even reluctantly as this conflict continued to spiral [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8892.26s)]
*  one day frank keeney walked into the union headquarters and demanded help from the umw [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8901.94s)]
*  to arrange mass meetings in the strike district but the union officials refused to send anybody [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8906.98s)]
*  and so frank keeney reads him the riot act and basically from that point on took the reins of [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8912.34s)]
*  the paint creek and soon the cabin creek strike himself well keeney had been in charleston trying [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8917.22s)]
*  to get some more union leaders to come up to cabin creek to help organize his miners [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8923.619999999999s)]
*  couldn't get anybody to come the national union had put down word that it was too dangerous [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8927.939999999999s)]
*  their organizers were to avoid the area and so when keeney heard that mother jones was in town [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8933.38s)]
*  he sought her out to see if she would come i'll come up she says i've been thinking of invading [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8939.539999999999s)]
*  that place for some time and so she told frank keeney that she would be there tuesday night [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8945.22s)]
*  and to spread the word that there was going to be a mass meeting mother jones tells the rest herself [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=8952.179999999998s)]

*  and since different company towns had different churches [[03:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12499.619999999999s)]
*  many miners would have had occasion to attend church in six maybe ten or more denominations [[03:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12503.22s)]
*  over the course of his life sometimes even miners who stayed put had their denomination [[03:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12509.22s)]
*  unexpectedly switched up on him when the coal mine changed ownership so while there was some [[03:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12515.38s)]
*  sectarian tension in the early days when operators were importing thousands of new people from all [[03:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12522.42s)]
*  over the place to populate the hills before long that was all washed away by the ecumenical nature [[03:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12528.18s)]
*  of the miner's life the irish catholic and the english anglican both had to attend the baptist [[03:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12534.34s)]
*  church and are both preached at by a company minister so they didn't see much use in fighting [[03:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12541.54s)]
*  over who was right this same spirit extended to racial and ethnic tensions of course no place is [[03:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12546.5s)]
*  perfect in that respect but the coal fields of southern west virginia were not only some of the [[03:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12555.7s)]
*  most diverse but also some of the most tolerant places you were likely to find anywhere in the [[03:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12561.300000000001s)]
*  country in those days as corbin said the blacks in another community well they would have attended [[03:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12566.5s)]
*  a black church in the black part of town where a black minister would preach the gospel in a manner [[03:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12573.86s)]
*  that is intended for a black audience their children would go to black schools and the black [[03:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12579.62s)]
*  adults would socialize with other black people well this was not possible in the company town [[03:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12586.1s)]
*  to the operators a miner was a miner they came and went occupying and vacating the company houses [[03:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12593.300000000001s)]
*  and facilities and then moving on maybe coming back sometime in the future but a miner was a minor [[03:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12600.900000000001s)]
*  so there was no sense in building separate areas for different groups of people black and white [[03:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12607.619999999999s)]
*  usually lived right next to each other in identical houses they ate identical food they went to the [[03:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12613.06s)]
*  same church their kids went to the same schools they socialized at the same saloons or recreational [[03:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12619.78s)]
*  centers and they bitched about the same mine operators in the few towns where a separate area [[03:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12625.38s)]
*  was built for black miners everything was the same quality as the rest of the town and very often [[03:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12632.26s)]
*  the black section would be half occupied with white miners with nowhere else to put them [[03:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12638.34s)]
*  or else the black section would overflow and there'd be black families living over in the [[03:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12643.14s)]
*  white section so nobody really thought much of it especially after a while because the black miners [[03:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12649.06s)]
*  saw that you know they and their ancestors had been through everything in the south but here in [[03:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12656.42s)]
*  west virginia the white miner was worked and abused and cheated and harassed and threatened [[03:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12662.02s)]
*  just like he was and the white miners saw that when the chips were down the black miner held the [[03:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12666.98s)]
*  line with him against the white operators and their white mine guards and the same went for [[03:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12674.1s)]
*  the various european ethnicities this was totally contrary to the intentions of the mine operators [[03:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12680.34s)]
*  themselves one mine operator told the journalists that they'd purposely hired all different kinds of [[03:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12687.460000000001s)]
*  miners americans dagos slobs niggers hungarians and poles they're pretty well mixed and you bet [[03:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12693.460000000001s)]
*  your life we try to keep them mixed as long as you've got them mixed they cannot talk to one [[03:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12701.86s)]
*  another so well and it keeps them out of mischief you can control them better when you got them mixed [[03:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12706.98s)]
*  the thing is it might be true for a while but only for a while [[03:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12714.42s)]
*  see the operators were worried that if they didn't mix the miners by race and ethnicity [[03:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12720.02s)]
*  that people of the same type would be able to come together and organize [[03:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12724.58s)]
*  but if they'd kept them separate that might have happened but the problem would have been smaller [[03:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12729.14s)]
*  scale maybe more containable oh the polish miners are starting to organize over there [[03:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12735.62s)]
*  no problem tell the hungarian miners that the poles are causing problems and get them fighting [[03:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12741.300000000001s)]
*  with each other then get rid of the poles the black miners are organizing over here [[03:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12745.380000000001s)]

*  its course but that didn't work when all the races were mixed together over time people [[03:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12754.34s)]
*  stopped identifying themselves by race or religion which would have kept the workers [[03:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12761.86s)]
*  chopped up into manageable groups and instead began to identify themselves as coal miners [[03:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12766.66s)]
*  it was the only identity that mattered it was their class not their religion not their race or [[03:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12773.300000000001s)]
*  ethnicity that determined their lot in life determined how they were treated where they were [[03:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12778.74s)]
*  everything they knew they could expect no solidarity from people of their own race if [[03:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12784.34s)]
*  those people were part of the ownership class they knew they could only rely on other miners [[03:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12790.1s)]
*  miners of all races and creeds they drank together they socialized together they fought together [[03:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12798.18s)]
*  they argued together they sang the same union songs together and over time they developed a [[03:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12804.98s)]
*  real spirit of brotherhood [[03:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=12811.78s)]

*  the u.s navy still ran on coal and needed the cleanest purest coal possible for its ships and [[03:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13336.58s)]
*  that coal was to be found in west virginia and the quality of west virginia's coal was the major [[03:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13342.74s)]
*  reason that the government built our largest navy base nearby there in norfolk virginia in 1917 [[03:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13349.779999999999s)]

*  and no labor unrest for the duration of the war coal miners were exempted from military service [[03:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13391.14s)]
*  because they were doing a job that was so central to the war effort but many of them volunteered [[03:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13398.1s)]
*  anyway so many of the miners had friends or brothers or cousins over there in france [[03:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13402.74s)]
*  and before you think the coal miners got off easy avoiding the war i should tell you that during [[03:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13409.539999999999s)]

*  had put a ceiling on the price to justify cutting miners wages but even still the miners did not go [[03:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13448.980000000001s)]

*  were necessary to end tyranny and make the world safe for democracy that violence was sometimes [[03:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13498.34s)]

*  to the dreary and oppressive life of a coal miner in a company town and so they sent men from [[03:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13511.14s)]
*  unionized districts down to mingo county to get them organized frank keeney who by this point was [[03:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13517.7s)]
*  the umwa district 17 president he comes down pistol on his hip to supervise the operation [[03:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13524.740000000002s)]
*  billy blizzards another one the union local president gave speeches to the miners in pouring [[03:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13532.1s)]
*  rain nobody went anywhere it was a real moment you had you had men of all races and ethnicities [[03:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13538.34s)]
*  coming together as miners in mingo county in 1920 there was one gathering where 500 miners prayed [[03:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13544.18s)]
*  and sang songs together and then a black miner stands up this is mostly a white crowd he says if [[03:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13551.14s)]
*  i wouldn't be a union man i'd go home and ask my wife to chain me in the yard with the dog [[03:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13556.82s)]
*  and everybody you white black immigrant didn't matter laughed together slapped them on the back [[03:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13562.1s)]
*  they were miners mother jones came in and gave a speech in mate one about 100 yards from the [[03:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13567.14s)]
*  kentucky border there frank keeney had warned the operators that in their present temper the mingo [[03:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13573.7s)]
*  miners are not to be fooled with they will oppose to the last any use of private armies enlisted by [[03:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13581.220000000001s)]
*  the coal companies the operators of course paid no attention to that and they just imported more and [[03:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13588.42s)]
*  baldwin felts guards [[03:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13596.58s)]
*  and so the miners begin going on strike many of them left their company homes voluntarily [[03:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13600.74s)]
*  taking up with their families on land rented by the union and tents provided by the union [[03:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13607.62s)]
*  within the early months of 1920 some 3000 miners in the tug valley had signed up for the united [[03:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13613.78s)]

*  back with everything they had figuring sid for an impulsive hillbilly the baldwin felts agency [[03:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13627.94s)]
*  tried to bribe sid hatfield offered him 300 a month to work for them which was a hell of a [[03:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13634.74s)]
*  lot of money for a poor kid from the tug valley back then you know that's a hell of a lot of [[03:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13640.9s)]
*  people today who would call that a pretty helpful dose of money in their lives [[03:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13646.58s)]
*  well sid told them to get bent then they tried to pay him just to let them install a machine gun [[03:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13651.62s)]
*  on the roof of a building in mate one he told him again to back off and they better get out of town [[03:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13657.78s)]
*  so the operators started cracking down on the union organizing and the miners strike began to [[03:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13664.74s)]
*  pick up and like clockwork baldwin felts guards were everywhere intimidating working miners [[03:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13670.34s)]
*  and driving the striking ones out of their homes one wet and cloudy day in may 1920 [[03:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13676.82s)]
*  13 baldwin felts men including two brothers of tom felts the president of the company [[03:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13686.1s)]
*  came in to mate one on a train most of them were big men with a very serious look [[03:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13692.98s)]
*  in dark suits and carrying cases that everyone who saw them knew contained guns [[03:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13700.34s)]
*  they get off the train and they go to mate one's hotel for a quick lunch and then as soon as they [[03:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13706.26s)]
*  arrive they climbed into three cars and headed up along mate creek to a company town where there [[03:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13710.74s)]
*  were several striking miners who were still living in their company homes and the people in town knew [[03:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13716.1s)]
*  exactly what that meant before long they got confirmation word starts coming back that the [[03:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13721.06s)]
*  detectives have already kicked one family out into the rain they've got plans a whole list for [[03:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13726.58s)]
*  many more and so the men in the town decided they were not going to let this happen and so they [[03:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13730.98s)]
*  headed back to their homes and got their guns sid hatfield was in town and he was more angry [[03:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13736.5s)]
*  than any of them he goes to the mayor and tells them what's going on and together they go up to [[03:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13743.38s)]
*  the side of the houses to go talk to al felts one of the brothers directing these evictions [[03:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13748.66s)]
*  when they get there they see a husband and a wife standing in the road in the rain the wife had been [[03:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13753.46s)]
*  washing clothes out back when they came in holding guns and told her to get out so she asked can i [[03:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13759.699999999999s)]
*  finish my laundry and wait until my husband gets back but they said no get out they start dumping [[03:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13765.3s)]
*  her furniture outside in the dirt her husband arrived just as sid and mayor testament were [[03:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13770.74s)]
*  getting there and so sid marches up to the leader al felts he demands to know what's your legal [[03:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13776.18s)]
*  authority for making these evictions felts tells him first of all this is not within mate one city [[03:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13781.62s)]
*  limits so it's not your jurisdiction and second anyway sure i've checked with the courts i got [[03:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13787.54s)]
*  all the authority in the world and so sid says well let me see it and al just blows them off he [[03:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13792.820000000002s)]
*  says go back to mate one and make some calls and figure it out yourself well sid's getting pretty [[03:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13797.460000000001s)]
*  heated by this point so the mayor comes in and intervenes pulls him back from the escalating [[03:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13802.820000000002s)]
*  situation and they go back to town with a big crowd of miners following behind them [[03:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13807.06s)]
*  when they get there they make some calls and they find out that in fact the baldwin felts guys were [[03:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13812.1s)]
*  not acting under any legal authority whatsoever and so sid announces with great satisfaction [[03:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13817.38s)]
*  that this gives him the power to arrest them for unlawfully throwing people out of their homes [[03:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13822.66s)]
*  and so he asked the deputy sheriff over the phone to write up and send arrest warrants for the guards [[03:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13829.46s)]
*  the deputy said they'd be on the next train to mate one that afternoon [[03:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13834.82s)]
*  somewhere in the conversation sid is supposed to have said that he'd like to kill the baldwin felts [[03:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13839.300000000001s)]
*  men which may have been a figure of speech at the time he made it but which would acquire importance [[03:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13843.54s)]
*  as the day proceeded just to be sure sid asked the mayor to write up his own arrest warrants on [[03:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13849.86s)]
*  the authority of the town so that for the time being until the county warrants arrived he could [[03:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13857.460000000001s)]
*  hold the men for illegally brandishing firearms within town limits and so the mayor did that [[03:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13862.66s)]
*  and by now everybody had heard what's going on miners were out in the streets most of them carrying [[03:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13868.18s)]
*  the rain started to pick up and more stories started trickling in of families with all their [[03:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13875.7s)]
*  belongings set out in the weather there was one story of a pregnant woman a sick child and a baby [[03:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13880.1s)]
*  in its crib set out in the rain with nowhere to go and so by the time the detectives roll back [[03:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13885.22s)]
*  into town just after four o'clock the miners were in an excitable mood [[03:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13890.82s)]
*  the guards went back to the hotel for dinner and afterward they came out into the street to catch [[03:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13898.34s)]
*  the five o'clock train the one with the county warrants coming in [[03:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13903.539999999999s)]
*  well sid hatfield goes and steps directly to al felts the leader of the men [[03:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13908.98s)]
*  both of them had holstered pistols and this is a scene straight out of an old west movie [[03:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13915.14s)]
*  the champion of the miners standing nose to nose with the chief of the baldman felts detectives [[03:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13920.42s)]
*  they're outside a hardware store and the tension was thick as armed miners are peeking through the [[03:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13928.26s)]
*  doors and windows to see what's going to happen here nobody knows exactly what's going to happen [[03:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13934.099999999999s)]
*  and so sid right now felts's face tells him i've got one thing i want to do and i'm going to do [[03:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=13938.019999999999s)]

*  all the miners would go on strike on july 1st unless the operators of the holdout districts [[04:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14437.78s)]

*  because there were some operators that were pretty solid and they saw no reason to invite the trouble [[04:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14487.460000000001s)]
*  or even to pay the union dues fair enough from the standpoint of the individual worker but the [[04:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14492.820000000002s)]
*  union's position was that it had to be all or nothing if any coal fields were left without a [[04:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14498.5s)]
*  union it would always undercut unionized fields and make the union's position in those fields [[04:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14504.58s)]
*  untenable some non-union miners received pay hikes or other benefits every time union organizers came [[04:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14509.62s)]

*  would be temporary because every individual miner is expendable and sure they raise your pay now but [[04:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14522.9s)]

*  workers he would have to negotiate not with individual men but with the mine workers of America [[04:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14554.9s)]
*  miners who resisted unionization were seen as a wedge that the companies could use to splinter [[04:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14562.98s)]
*  and break up the whole movement and so they were not looked on kindly very often by the miners who [[04:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14568.98s)]
*  were trying to organize and of course scabs as sympathetic as many of their stories were [[04:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14573.699999999999s)]
*  uh and the miners were aware that most of the scabs were just poor schmucks looking for a job [[04:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14579.939999999999s)]
*  but the miners viewed them like soldiers in the enemy trench and not bad men necessarily and [[04:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14586.099999999999s)]
*  in more peaceful days they could have all been friends like the French and German boys freezing [[04:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14593.539999999999s)]

*  then so be it it was determined as they were to gain recognition of their union the operators were [[04:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=14610.099999999999s)]

*  awed the miners especially the veterans suddenly a miner in the crowd blurted out [[05:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=18562.58s)]
*  my god we wouldn't revolt against the national government and with that the tension broke and [[05:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=18568.82s)]
*  some of the vets started rushing forward to try to shake his hand and tell the general about [[05:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=18575.06s)]

*  and then saw them off on it well that experience had won general banhols over too and what he saw [[05:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=18584.02s)]
*  were not blood-crazed anarchists but good american boys who just gotten a little riled up that's all [[05:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=18591.86s)]
*  and so he wired washington dc and said keep the troops on standby they won't be needed for now [[05:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=18597.940000000002s)]

*  but there were still miners headed to logan and still chafin's forces were arrayed on the ridge [[05:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=18609.379999999997s)]
*  to oppose them it was also captain brachis that vengeful commander of the state police whose men [[05:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=18615.54s)]
*  had been humiliated by some of the miners he had spent the interval getting the names of all the [[05:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=18622.899999999998s)]

*  and so he took a force of 70 state troopers on an expedition to go arrest them early one morning [[05:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=18633.94s)]
*  and so he rendezvoused with chafin who reinforced him with another 230 men bringing his number up [[05:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407acHQpzR4&t=18642.739999999998s)]
