# #7 - Approaching the Aztecs - A Drunken Introduction
**Martyr Made:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI)
*  Hey everybody, this is Darrell Cooper and you're listening to the Martyr Made Podcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=0.0s)]
*  You're about to hear a somewhat lighthearted episode inspired by my friend Daniele's History [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=7.96s)]
*  on Fire podcast series on the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=13.96s)]
*  I thought it would be fun to explore some related themes like mythology, human sacrifice, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=17.8s)]
*  and cannibalism, and this is just a little intro episode to kick things off. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=24.6s)]

*  You can find the Substack at martyrmade.substack.com. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=48.42s)]
*  Without further ado, here we go. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=53.74s)]
*  I am content to die for my beliefs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=58.699999999999996s)]
*  So cut off my head and make me a martyr. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=63.419999999999995s)]
*  The people will always remember it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=69.3s)]
*  No, they will forget. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=73.46s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=77.86s)]
*  God is a thought. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=80.25999999999999s)]
*  God is an idea. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=81.78s)]
*  It is a place. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=84.97999999999999s)]
*  It is somewhere. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=86.18s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=89.22000000000001s)]
*  But its reference is to something that transcends all things. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=92.34s)]
*  I ask why we must tear ourselves apart for this small question of religion. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=101.14000000000001s)]
*  So this is definitely not how I intended to start this series off. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=107.38s)]
*  Let's just begin with that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=117.06s)]
*  I had a few too many Bloody Marys at breakfast this morning and I'm still feeling that pretty [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=119.06s)]
*  strongly and this is not so much a fully prepared episode as it is a very long introduction [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=123.94s)]
*  to what I'm going to be doing over the next few months. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=129.82s)]
*  It seems like every project that I put my hand to the same thing happens. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=133.86s)]
*  It always ends up growing into this monster that I can't control. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=137.46s)]
*  And before I know it, instead of digging into one topic that I wanted to talk to you guys [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=141.18s)]
*  about I'm trying to solve some ancient human problem that people infinitely smarter than [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=145.86s)]
*  me have been banging their heads against for centuries. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  As if I'm going to unlock the hidden secret to it or something. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=152.5s)]
*  But I can't help it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=156.82000000000002s)]
*  It just seems to be the way my brain works. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=157.82000000000002s)]
*  And so I've got a few notes here but this is going to be very informal. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=160.74s)]
*  I'm going to be winging this half drunk with you guys because I've got a little bit more [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=164.3s)]
*  work to do on the first real episode but I wanted to check in and kind of let you know [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=168.62s)]
*  what I got cooking. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=171.86s)]
*  See I've got this really bad habit that makes getting these episodes out to you guys in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=173.34s)]
*  a timely manner very difficult if you hadn't noticed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=179.94s)]
*  I usually pull out the excuse that you know unlike many of the other podcasters maybe [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=184.46s)]
*  I've got a full time day job and takes up most of my time and that's true. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=189.62s)]
*  That is true. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=193.22000000000003s)]
*  But the truth is I still probably managed to put in at least as many hours per day as [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=194.22000000000003s)]
*  anybody else that I know that does this kind of stuff. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=198.78s)]
*  It's not really the issue. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=200.94000000000003s)]
*  The real problem is that I have not learned and I have tried but I've not learned at all [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  for any other podcasters that end up listening to this have some tips for me. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  I'd love to hear it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  I have not learned at all how to restrict the scope of these discussions so that I don't [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  fall into this trap of mission creep you know where it just expands and expands and we'll [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=217.32s)]
*  take the last series I did Fear and Loathing in the New Jerusalem. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=222.72s)]
*  It was a series on the Arab-Israeli conflict. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=225.68s)]
*  When I started that that was supposed to be one or two episodes maybe an hour to a piece. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=229.66s)]
*  That's what I thought and I thought that to make one or two episodes of an hour to a piece [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=235.0s)]
*  we're going to take me from the beginning of the story where I did start all the way [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  up to the present day. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=243.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  Six episodes and 25-26 hours later I'd managed to tell the story of the Arab-Israeli conflict [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=245.96s)]
*  only up to the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948 and even then there's still [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=252.8s)]
*  a ton of stuff that I had to skim over or just leave out altogether that felt like cutting [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  off one of my arms. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  They felt completely vital even with the length that that thing ended up being. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  It turns out that the more I investigate a topic any topic it seems like instead of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=272.36s)]
*  having more to say about it you know instead of having more to say the more I know I end [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=276.72s)]
*  up having less and less and less that I feel like I can say with any confidence at all. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=281.54s)]
*  When I read six books on the Arab-Israeli conflict just stay away from me. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=289.24s)]
*  If you ventured too close to me I'd sit you down and explain the whole history of the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=296.16s)]
*  conflict and what it all meant and whose fault everything was and what should be done about [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  it and I would just if you were unlucky enough to venture into my vicinity and be patient [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=304.8s)]
*  enough to listen to me talk it was just not a good idea. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=309.0s)]
*  You know I had all the answers when I'd read six books about it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=311.6s)]
*  By the time I'd read my 60th book on it you know I was in a place feeling like the issue [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  is so complicated that you can't understand anything about it at all without taking it [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=320.12s)]
*  all the way back to fundamental questions about human sociability and social identity [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=325.88s)]
*  and group dynamics and psychology. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=331.64s)]
*  I mean it just keeps growing and growing but people who show up for a discussion of the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=333.8s)]
*  Israeli-Palestinian conflict presumably wouldn't have a lot of patience for dry lectures on [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=338.84s)]
*  those abstract ideas certainly not for me you know but I just I tend to have a really [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=343.92s)]
*  hard time figuring out which layer to draw that line under. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=349.36s)]
*  You know you work your way down and you say well you know ideas and customs and our modes [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=353.56s)]
*  of daily interaction in society our habits of life all these things that kind of make [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  up our cultural milieu all of these build on one another like a pyramid. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  Each layer above it is dependent on the layer below it being fully secure and in place. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=372.84s)]
*  Now when we look at a pyramid our eye is naturally drawn by the outline up the sides toward the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=378.92s)]
*  peak and then maybe from there vaulted up into the sky up into the heavens to some star [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  constellation or dwelling place of the dead to which we imagine the thing is pointing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  right because you know that might even be the point of the shape of a pyramid to draw [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=396.6s)]
*  us upward like that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=400.16s)]
*  We rarely spend much time and wonder or contemplation or awe over the base of the pyramid or those [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=402.56s)]
*  middle layers that are almost there just to hold up that peak at the top you know that's [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=407.0s)]
*  the way we treat it sometimes even though the lower levels are closer to all of us and [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=411.96s)]
*  the base does more to set the parameters of the overall structure than any section built [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=418.92s)]
*  above it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=423.56s)]
*  I'm kind of stretching this analogy but again I'm not talking really about a literal pyramid [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=424.56s)]
*  Well the ideas that form the base right this this cultural pyramid this pyramid of ideas [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=430.72s)]
*  the ideas that form the base are the ones that we don't even think about because they're [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  so self evident and they're so fundamental to this particular version of the world that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=441.52s)]
*  we've built out for ourselves. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=446.16s)]
*  When you get yourself up to the top of the pyramid that is pyramid of ideas or cultural [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=449.32s)]
*  pyramid maybe it's crowned by a lofty idea like universal human rights for example right [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=453.58s)]
*  we use universal human rights by the time you get up to something like universal human [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=460.58s)]
*  rights that that could even pop into somebody's head in your culture you're already standing [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=464.85999999999996s)]
*  on the shoulders of ideas that were in their own time in their own day of novelty they [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=471.46s)]
*  were world historical achievements of the human race. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=476.53999999999996s)]
*  At some point if you trace our line of development back far enough we had to figure out and [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=481.46s)]
*  I mean this on a very fundamental cognitive level we had to figure out how to abstract [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=487.62s)]
*  the idea of the human out from actual instances of individual humans right that didn't come [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=493.18s)]
*  naturally to us we didn't climb out of the trees onto the savanna and naturally have [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=500.26s)]
*  the ability to draw an abstract concept concept out from particularities that way was something [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=505.06s)]
*  we had to learn how to do over a long period of time and when we did I mean this was a [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=511.74s)]
*  tremendous achievement. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=515.78s)]
*  It's an antecedent to something like universal human rights we don't even think about the [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=517.98s)]
*  fact that first you have to be able to abstract out the idea of the human to even think about [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=523.58s)]
*  something like abstract human rather universal human rights. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=528.7s)]
*  But we did and we had to go through that at some point it's one of those lower levels [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=533.34s)]
*  of the pyramid right so we had to be able to posit the idea of abstract values good [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=538.1800000000001s)]
*  bad right wrong and so forth we had to abstract those out from their attachment to a given [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=543.58s)]
*  event or circumstance or person or thing right that bad thing that good person. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=548.1800000000001s)]
*  We had to be able to abstract the principle of the good or the principle of bad out that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=555.82s)]
*  we had to learn that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=560.3s)]
*  A whole mountain of axioms of a priori axioms had to be drilled into us so deeply and so [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=562.3s)]
*  firmly that they were completely solid and seemed unquestionable and self-evident before [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=567.5s)]
*  we could build anything on top of it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=572.22s)]
*  As you move from the top down toward the base of the pyramid I might be stretching this [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=576.26s)]
*  analogy a little bit now the consequences of destabilizing it of beginning to question [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=581.74s)]
*  things become more and more serious the lower you go. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=587.26s)]
*  You start asking questions about how the base is put together and suddenly everything above [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=592.38s)]
*  it starts shifting around and that's kind of what happens when I start looking into [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=597.3s)]
*  a topic like I am here the Mesoamerican civilization the Aztecs and the confrontation with the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=602.3s)]
*  Spanish. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=608.8199999999999s)]
*  I can study Aztec mythology for an explanation of the role human sacrifice played in their [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=611.18s)]
*  society for example. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=616.42s)]
*  That's maybe up at the top of the pyramid but once I'm down at the level of asking [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=619.3s)]
*  fundamental questions about their social forms and their individual psychology then all the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=623.6999999999999s)]
*  consciously conjured explanations start to look secondary and almost superfluous. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=629.18s)]
*  And so sure enough once I started going really hard on a lot of the topics involved here [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=636.26s)]
*  I started getting pulled down into that vortex where I start out reading an anthropology [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=643.0999999999999s)]
*  book specifically about Aztec sacrifice and by the time I look up from my reading I'm [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=648.6999999999999s)]
*  on my third book about developmental psychology. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=653.8199999999999s)]
*  Something that is absolutely vital to understanding sacrifice I think but at a certain point if [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=657.8599999999999s)]
*  you have a mind like mine you end up having to take it all the way back to the Garden [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=665.3399999999999s)]
*  of Eden and work your way or the Big Bang and work your way up from there because everything [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=669.58s)]
*  seems completely important when you start getting down that deep. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=674.0600000000001s)]
*  Dealing with the Aztecs makes me particularly vulnerable to this not just because I've been [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=680.1s)]
*  fascinated with Mesoamerican culture for a long time but because to a modern westerner [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=684.4200000000001s)]
*  the Aztecs are so profoundly alien that it's very difficult not to be pulled into basic [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=690.38s)]
*  questions about what it means to be a human being. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=698.42s)]
*  I'm starting this off this way because I think that there's a tendency partly natural and [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=703.14s)]
*  partly ideological to imagine that peoples of different cultures and past ages were more [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=708.5s)]
*  or less just like us only with different ideas maybe that you know different beliefs that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=714.6999999999999s)]
*  informed their their ways of life. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=720.4599999999999s)]
*  I don't think that that is true I don't believe that at all actually. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=722.98s)]
*  In fact I'm going to make the case over the next few episodes that the consciously held [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=726.3399999999999s)]
*  beliefs the things that people will tell you they believe you know their religious doctrines [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=731.4599999999999s)]
*  and so forth those are way up at the top of the pyramid and you could honestly change [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=735.9799999999999s)]
*  a lot of them back and forth and you would not see a tremendous structural change in [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=739.54s)]
*  a culture. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=744.2199999999999s)]
*  By the time you get up to the consciously held and outwardly spoken beliefs you know [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=745.2199999999999s)]
*  those are it's like shaving a couple inches off the top of that thing you know the difference [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=749.6999999999999s)]
*  is between cultures the things that really make cultures different are far deeper. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=756.22s)]
*  You know an alien peoples especially a culture is isolated and as profoundly alien as the [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=762.1800000000001s)]
*  Mesoamericans are to us. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=767.1s)]
*  I think that these cultures are producing profoundly different kinds of human beings. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=769.5400000000001s)]
*  I have to unpack that a little bit because well I have to unpack what I mean by it and [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=776.78s)]
*  the extent to which I take it seriously because you know for one thing it's a statement that [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=782.38s)]
*  is not without controversial political baggage you know but but also because it's going to [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=787.74s)]
*  inform the way that I approach this great world historical confrontation between the [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=793.1800000000001s)]
*  Aztecs and the Spanish as we move through this series of episodes. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=797.5400000000001s)]
*  You know many people would hear me say that peoples of past cultures are profoundly different [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=802.7800000000001s)]
*  and they would interpret that as a slur somehow but I think that that tells us a lot about [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=808.82s)]
*  how this particular point of ideology functions. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=813.58s)]
*  The propagators of this kind of universalistic mainstream ideology in the West today have [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=817.72s)]
*  kind of pulled a very interesting Jiu-Jitsu trick. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=822.66s)]
*  See we decided somewhere along the line very remarkably if you look at history I don't [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=826.1s)]
*  know if there are too many parallels to this but we decided to disavow our own past of [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=830.3s)]
*  you know our own history of conquest and colonization and to replace the false glory of that past [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=836.58s)]
*  with this universalist religion based on tolerance and human rights and some of the accessories [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=842.74s)]
*  that go with those things right. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=847.5s)]
*  Well down at the core of that ideology is a deep belief that people everywhere are pretty [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=850.02s)]
*  much the same. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=854.74s)]
*  Now conveniently for our geopolitical goals I think and for our own cultural self-understanding [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=857.7s)]
*  we interpret that the idea that everybody everywhere is pretty much the same we interpret [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=864.78s)]
*  that to mean that everyone is just like us and must in their heart of hearts if they [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=870.0600000000001s)]
*  were free to express it or if they just had things explained to them properly that they [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=875.22s)]
*  would want what we want value what we value they're just like us. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=878.94s)]
*  So of course the next thing you know we're invading countries so that their people can [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=884.1s)]
*  be free to express their true inner nature which we imagine must be that of a docile [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=887.5s)]
*  progressive Democrat from New Hampshire or something. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=893.18s)]
*  Former President George W Bush's defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld he promised us that when we [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=896.9399999999999s)]
*  went into Iraq we were going to be greeted with flowers in the streets by grateful people [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=901.78s)]
*  and while there was I'm sure some willful blindness and probably a little cynicism in [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=907.26s)]
*  that claim I don't think he was just lying because it reflects a bias that's very common [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=911.78s)]
*  on both the left and the right in the United States. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=916.5799999999999s)]
*  Simply put there is only one kind of human being we have identified that type and we [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=920.66s)]
*  best exemplify it's true nature right and deviations from post 1960s Western norms wherever [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=926.5s)]
*  they're found in history or around the world today we don't take them on their own terms [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=935.14s)]
*  but try to figure out even if we don't put it this way what's wrong with them. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=940.3s)]
*  We see people throughout history that are profoundly different from us that requires [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=946.62s)]
*  explanation. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=952.1s)]
*  Of course there are a lot of ways in which we're all similar especially with regard to [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=955.98s)]
*  our outward behavior. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=960.26s)]
*  You'll often hear people point out that people everywhere just want to make a living and [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=962.58s)]
*  take care of their families and yeah sure true enough but how far does that really get [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=966.0600000000001s)]
*  us. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=971.1s)]
*  Those drives are not even uniquely human the desire to procure a living from the earth [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=972.82s)]
*  and to care for your kin group that's at least universal to social mammals and you [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=977.1400000000001s)]
*  can actually trace it back much further than that so it doesn't give us a lot of information [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=981.4200000000001s)]
*  about ourselves you're talking about the very base of the pyramid when you talk about things [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=985.74s)]
*  like that and actually that's another feature of the pyramid although you know let me switch [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=989.96s)]
*  the metaphor up because that one's starting to lose its purpose. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=996.22s)]
*  I was about to say that the lower you move down the pyramid the more people share whatever's [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1000.0600000000001s)]
*  found at each successive level but instead let's think of it as a tree and the trunk [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1004.94s)]
*  consists of those things that you share with all mankind and then a major branch is what [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1009.62s)]
*  you share with your culture and a smaller offshoot is what you share with your particular [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1015.54s)]
*  society and it's more and more finely articulated until you've run through the levels of social [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1020.22s)]
*  identification until you're talking about the twigs and leaves that are the small cultural [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1025.82s)]
*  universes you share with you know with family and other local affiliations and then finally [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1030.3799999999999s)]
*  maybe pictured as the flower or the fruit of the entire production the one person culture [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1035.7s)]
*  you know the one person little cultural world that we call your individual inner life. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1042.3s)]
*  This is the way to understand what the great psychologist Carl Jung meant when he spoke [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1049.78s)]
*  of the archetypes of the collective unconscious. That idea the collective unconscious it often [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1053.46s)]
*  gets twisted up into this sort of new agey myth as if it's this metaphysical realm of [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1058.98s)]
*  platonic forms that somehow impress themselves upon us they have an independent existence [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1064.66s)]
*  somewhere and they're impressing themselves into the mind that's not at all what he meant. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1069.66s)]
*  Jung was a very rigorous thinker and that's not how he was that's not what he was talking [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1075.5s)]
*  about. The collective unconscious is not one thing. It exists at each level of social identification [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1079.58s)]
*  okay there's a constellation of symbols and meanings that you share with all mankind and [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1086.34s)]
*  then others that you share only with your family and then everything in between and [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1092.34s)]
*  each of those are a type of collective unconscious. This is mostly the result of experiences that [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1098.02s)]
*  you share with people at each level and it allows social communion of more or less depth [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1104.46s)]
*  and detail depending on the symbolic vocabulary you share with each level. So what I mean [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1110.14s)]
*  is if you meet an absolute stranger right somebody from another continent completely [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1116.7800000000002s)]
*  you know it could be somebody just a million miles away from you culturally linguistically [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1123.3400000000001s)]
*  everything if you meet an absolute stranger dying of thirst or crying out in pain you'll [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1127.72s)]
*  find that you're perfectly able to understand his attempts to communicate with you and that [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1134.02s)]
*  you can actually respond in a way that closes the loop of that interaction very naturally. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1139.1s)]
*  You'll be able to do that because you're dealing with experiences that are absolutely universal [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1146.1s)]
*  to humans but to be able to see through say an outward display of contentment to know [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1151.46s)]
*  that what somebody really needs is a hug they might be smiling and seeming happy but they're [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1158.78s)]
*  actually sad and they need a hug that might only work for very close family members right [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1163.54s)]
*  with whom you can communicate in a much more a much richer more detailed nuanced way because [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1168.58s)]
*  you share a constellation of symbols in a vocabulary of meaning that is much deeper. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1174.94s)]
*  So again for all of our cultural differences there are many experiences that are fundamental [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1180.8799999999999s)]
*  or seem to be fundamental to the human condition that provide something like I don't know an [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1185.54s)]
*  initial operating system into which the culture comes along and loads its applications. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1190.98s)]
*  I missed your analogy today we'll see how all these go so I'm thinking of I'm thinking [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1196.74s)]
*  of universals like oh the trauma of being pushed out of the birth canal right or of [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1200.98s)]
*  having to traverse that terrifying gap between the unified experience of early infancy right [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1207.3400000000001s)]
*  very early on when your sense of self when your perception of your mother and the rest [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1214.18s)]
*  of the world that's all still one thing it hasn't been differentiated out so you've [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1218.9s)]
*  got this feeling of connectedness and oneness with everything when all you have to do is [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1222.66s)]
*  cry out and just make a noise if you're hungry just make a noise and a nipple appears and [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1227.7s)]
*  now you're not hungry anymore I mean just the omnipotence of that this is what Freud [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1232.46s)]
*  thought was the root of all magical thinking but that's going to be in a future episode. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1236.66s)]
*  And so to traverse that gap between the experience of total unity and complete omnipotence to [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1241.5800000000002s)]
*  first starting to notice that you know sometimes you cry out nothing happens what's up with [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1248.5s)]
*  that and then that's followed by this horrible realization traumatic it's a truly traumatic [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1253.62s)]
*  realization that you and your mother which you hadn't quite differentiated before as [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1259.14s)]
*  separate creatures you know that your mother who at this point in your life as far as you [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1263.9s)]
*  know is the source of all warmth and nourishment and affection and everything that you everything [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1269.02s)]
*  to your survival that you two are actually separate beings and she's got her own will [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1275.22s)]
*  that has nothing to do with you she's got other beings in her life that concern her [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1279.22s)]
*  perhaps as much as you do realizing that you've got to compete for your mother's attention [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1284.78s)]
*  and that one of your competitors is this gigantic male who is much more complicated to relate [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1291.6200000000001s)]
*  to than she is you know this is your basic Oedipus complex or process Oedipus process [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1296.98s)]
*  I would prefer to say and this is all very basic Freudian psychology but the reason it's [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1303.34s)]
*  basic is that it's more or less common to more or less everybody you don't have to [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1307.58s)]
*  sexualize it like Freud does to get the basic idea you know and you can keep carrying it [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1313.22s)]
*  on up through infancy and early childhood you can you can take this through life there [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1317.4199999999998s)]
*  are certain things that we share you can keep going through the experience as a small child [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1320.6599999999999s)]
*  of being fully dependent on and surrounded by these giants who as far as you can tell [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1326.4199999999998s)]
*  are basically all powerful you know how else is a small child supposed to understand beings [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1330.78s)]
*  that were there from the very beginning as far as far as they know who control the environment [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1337.02s)]
*  that they inhabit who is the source of all their food and water and clothing and everything [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1342.54s)]
*  else that's important who if they wanted to could just pick you up and throw you across [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1348.46s)]
*  the room or end your life if they chose by force or just through simple neglect they [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1352.98s)]
*  could forget about you and you would die you got to navigate that as a small child [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1357.9s)]
*  you got to figure out how to do that there's no instruction manual and everybody has to [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1362.6200000000001s)]
*  do that no matter where you are or when you were born by the time we get to be adults [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1367.74s)]
*  we're not really so impressed by adults anymore because we look at ourselves and we're like [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1373.66s)]
*  this I hope this is not what all the fuss was about but it's hard to overstate how large [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1377.02s)]
*  adults loom in the young child's world you know as it's just starting to learn what a [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1382.38s)]
*  world is and what this one happens to be like and so then of course we have the experience [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1386.42s)]
*  of having to navigate the moods of these giants and how to manipulate them to get what you [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1392.78s)]
*  need from them and so forth I mean these are very basic human experiences that everybody [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1397.38s)]
*  from a paleolithic hunter-gatherer to a wall street banker have shared and there's information [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1402.16s)]
*  there that we can extract and all those early childhood experiences remember these are happening [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1408.5800000000002s)]
*  not after your ego has been consolidated and filled out so it's not as if somebody plucked [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1415.6200000000001s)]
*  you today out of your house and dropped you among you know giant creatures that you had [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1419.94s)]
*  to figure out how to relate to no no no this is all happening before you even have a coherent [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1424.22s)]
*  self-concept or personality or or any behavioral models that you can kind of follow to help [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1428.8200000000002s)]
*  you navigate any of this in fact this is the process that creates all of those things for [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1434.18s)]
*  you and so there is going to be a substratum of human experience that serves as a more or less [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1439.74s)]
*  universal say foundation on which the culture can build its unique human adult subjects and then so [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1446.78s)]
*  you keep going you think of the period when culture begins to take the reins from nature or [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1456.46s)]
*  maybe you could say nature quarries the stone and drags it over to the building site and then culture [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1460.7s)]
*  takes over with a hammer and chisel to you know start to work on your on your unique features [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1466.26s)]
*  adolescence is this period where nature and culture both seem to have a hand very firmly [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1473.3s)]
*  on our shoulders right as we're experiencing awakening sexuality and our aggressive drives [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1479.3s)]
*  begin to become more dangerous than just a little child's tantrum now we begin to interact with the [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1485.7s)]
*  culture in the form of taboos and customs that repress and sublimate and structure our sexual [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1490.74s)]
*  and aggressive motivations in a mode that hopefully you know if everything goes the way it's supposed [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1496.82s)]
*  to it structures our sexual and aggressive motivations in a way that allows them to be [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1502.82s)]
*  expressed within a pro-social framework because you know human aggressive and sexual drives can [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1507.6200000000001s)]
*  tear a social body apart if you don't learn how to structure them [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1514.18s)]
*  and you can keep on going on and on from you know through the transition from dependency on the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1516.98s)]
*  society to responsibility for the society to the dawning awareness of your own death and then of [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1523.06s)]
*  the insubstantial and temporary nature of the things that draw your attraction and attachment [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1530.34s)]
*  through life you know these are primordial experiences that that give rise first to behaviors [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1535.14s)]
*  that give rise first to behaviors and then to symbols and narrative and narrative is just the [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1541.78s)]
*  means by which we string symbols together and sort of sort of alchemically meld them into various [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1547.94s)]
*  mythological alloys and then straight on to abstract concepts that can be stated theoretically [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1555.1399999999999s)]
*  these are the three fundamental modes of human cognition and learning [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1563.06s)]
*  a very young child first learns through through mimesis right by by mimicking the behavior of [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1566.98s)]
*  others a child learns to speak by mimicking the speech of others for example and it turns out that [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1573.3s)]
*  different things are more easily learned in different modes and more easily communicated [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1580.58s)]
*  in different modes if i wanted to teach a kid to tie his shoes for example i'm not going to break [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1584.74s)]
*  that down theoretically for him i don't even know what that would look like i don't know how that [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1589.86s)]
*  would work i'm going to primarily use mimesis just have them get their own shoe and watch me [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1594.42s)]
*  and copy what i do until they can replicate it on their own that's the easiest way to teach [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1601.46s)]
*  someone to tie shoes and maybe i'll reinforce it with a little bit of you know symbolic mythological [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1606.26s)]
*  language let's say i remember some version of this from when i was a kid and parents today still [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1612.18s)]
*  helped help their children learn to tie shoes with these little rhymes i don't know if you [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1618.9s)]
*  remember anything like this but you tell a kid to make a little bunny ear out of each lace and hold [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1623.38s)]
*  one in each hand and then you say bunny ears bunny ears playing by a tree chris cost the tree trying [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1628.74s)]
*  to catch me bunny ears bunny ears jumped to the hole popped out the other side beautiful and bold [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1633.8600000000001s)]
*  there's a lot of kids that learn how to tie their shoes that way through a combination of mimicking [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1639.46s)]
*  watching somebody and just copying them and then having an easily memorable sort of mental ditty [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1644.74s)]
*  in their head they can kind of keep them on track it's a combination of mimetic learning and [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1651.86s)]
*  symbolic mythological learning let's say it might sound silly to call that a myth but it's not as [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1658.58s)]
*  silly as it sounds i think when european explorers first started to come across these very very [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1664.6599999999999s)]
*  primitive aborigines in various parts of the world they often found that they had religions if you [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1671.06s)]
*  insist on calling them that i don't you you don't want to call them religions they're really not but [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1677.54s)]
*  let's not get distracted by that right now so their their religions seem so primitive precisely [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1682.18s)]
*  because they're so practical and particular and we often find that these these very very primitive [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1688.26s)]
*  tribes that we come across that their their rituals and their myths mostly have very direct [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1696.82s)]
*  day-to-day concerns having to do with preserving the technical and environmental and social [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1702.98s)]
*  knowledge that they'd accumulated so far you know everything you can think of how to butcher game [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1707.5400000000002s)]
*  how to make baskets how to cook various foods how to find water and draw water properly anything [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1713.5400000000002s)]
*  you can think of that's just a part of daily life was a ritual act that had a corresponding [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1719.22s)]
*  myth explaining in story form how the first instance of that act was performed in the world [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1725.7s)]
*  for pedagogical purposes probably these these instances these stories were strung together [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1731.06s)]
*  into a larger story it was easier to remember if you just tied it all together into one thing and [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1736.42s)]
*  easier to pass down so you know to go back to the example i just used maybe it's a little weak i'm [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1741.38s)]
*  not sure but you get the point to go back to the example i just used with the bunny ears maybe i [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1746.98s)]
*  want to teach you how to tie shoes and how to tie a necktie right and so maybe you would tie two [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1751.86s)]
*  similar narratives together and say bunny ears bunny ears playing by a tree crisscross the tree [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1758.1s)]
*  trying to catch me bunny ears bunny ears jumped into the hole popped out the other side beautiful [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1762.42s)]
*  and bold but then you might follow it up with i climbed up the tree to look out on the lake and [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1766.98s)]
*  what did i find but a big fat snake so it's like you've climbed up the body to the neck [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1771.3s)]
*  and the tie is a snake hanging there and then maybe you go through some permutations where [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1776.18s)]
*  the snake chases you through the motions of tying a necktie say right so it's a trivial example but [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1780.18s)]
*  it's a trivial example but very early primitive mythologies are full of this kind of thing [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1785.3s)]
*  scholars like eric havelock at the university of toronto [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1792.26s)]
*  he found similar things even in the iliad we're going to have a whole section in a future episode [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1796.5s)]
*  on that but uh or another the great professor of religious studies mercha eliade wrote extensively [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1801.54s)]
*  on how these very early mythologies described how various firsts came into the world that's [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1808.66s)]
*  that's really what most of them were like how did it was either how did this river come into being [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1815.3000000000002s)]
*  how did clouds come into being why do magpies have a stripe on their back or why do we cook [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1820.5s)]
*  things a certain way how do we make baskets and so forth and uh he describes eliade describes how [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1826.02s)]
*  how basically these are providing models for the people in these societies to follow [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1834.1000000000001s)]
*  ancient mythologies from africa to australia to the new world are all full of the refrain [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1839.3000000000002s)]
*  and this is why we build huts as we do or this is why we make baskets to this day as we do and so [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1844.5s)]
*  forth and in its true form it's not trivial at all it's the least trivial thing you can imagine [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1850.5s)]
*  you know the vast majority of what these people needed to know about the world [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1856.74s)]
*  and and really this is still true is learned more easily through mimesis and narrative than it is by [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1861.46s)]
*  theory if i want to tell you how to tie your shoes over the phone i you know yeah over the phone so [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1866.82s)]
*  we're talking on the phone and i want to tell you to tie your shoes and you don't have shoes in front [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1874.4199999999998s)]
*  of you and neither do i i would actually have to think about that for a second i would have to [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1878.26s)]
*  visualize it in my mind and even then it's kind of hard to keep track of what i'm what i'm doing [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1882.02s)]
*  you know you take the right lace and loop it in front of the left lace and then back around to [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1887.22s)]
*  come through the space that they form and even here i'm already turning it into a narrative right [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1892.02s)]
*  talking about the laces forming spaces and so forth it's not easy to take something like that [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1896.8200000000002s)]
*  and just explain it theoretically certain modes of communication and cognition lend themselves to [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1902.9s)]
*  certain things if you don't have shoes right in front of you to follow along as i speak but [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1907.7s)]
*  instead have to remember the whole thing until later on when you do have your shoes it's probably [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1912.98s)]
*  not going to happen but if i tell you to take a lace in each hand fold it over into bunny ears [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1917.3s)]
*  and then tell you that rhyme from earlier you'd probably remember it well enough [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1923.78s)]
*  to figure it out on your own after a few tries [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1928.26s)]
*  for us moderns these three modes of cognition are so natural and so intertwined that they [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1932.74s)]
*  usually just melt together we take all of them for granted but understanding that they are in fact [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1938.82s)]
*  separate modes is extremely important i can't teach you psychology through embodied mimesis [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1945.22s)]
*  i can teach you a very deep psychology through narrative though you read a good book by you know [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1954.18s)]
*  dostoevsky or camus or roth and you're learning psychology but to take the knowledge contained [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1960.42s)]
*  in all those novels and break it down into abstract concepts now you have to be able to [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1967.8600000000001s)]
*  deal in theoretical thinking psychology is an interesting example because just like the shoe [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1972.26s)]
*  tying example that draws on mimetic and narrative thinking psychology moves between narrative and [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1978.9s)]
*  theoretical thinking so naturally that i'd say both are probably indispensable you might lay out [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1984.9s)]
*  a psychological concept but inevitably it's going to be followed by some kind of narrative example [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1991.54s)]
*  how it plays out through a person's behavior if i want to explain what obsessive compulsive [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=1996.1s)]
*  disorder is i might pull out a textbook and say obsessive compulsive disorder is a condition in [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2003.06s)]
*  which blah blah blah whatever and maybe you'll get some idea of it but then i'll tell you a story [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2007.9399999999998s)]
*  about someone who washes his hands a hundred times a day and then that narrative crystallizes it for [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2012.8999999999999s)]
*  you and gives the theory some shape and since you'll actually envision in your mind the person [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2017.62s)]
*  engaging in the hand washing behavior while i'm actually talking about it there's actually a shade [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2025.54s)]
*  of mimesis in there as well since you're modeling the behavior internally as you listen but you know [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2029.54s)]
*  so we move back and forth between these three modes focusing on whichever mode is most appropriate [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2035.06s)]
*  for the subject at hand and for the developmental stage of the person that we're talking to [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2040.8999999999999s)]
*  because that's the other part of this on one hand some kinds of knowledge or understanding are more [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2047.7s)]
*  easily expressed in a given mode but people also pass through these stages as their individual [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2052.82s)]
*  subjectivity is filled out you can't very well teach a child anything through narrative or theory [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2059.38s)]
*  until it's learned language through mimesis and until it's been sufficiently socialized by [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2066.42s)]
*  imitating the behavior of adults and older children right and from there you don't move [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2071.1400000000003s)]
*  straight into philosophical ethics or abstract theology if you want to teach them how to behave [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2077.06s)]
*  you start giving them models of behavior through fairy tales and religious stories and so forth [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2081.86s)]
*  you have to progress through these stages in that order because they represent [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2088.1800000000003s)]
*  developmental levels of abstraction first you learn how to act in the world then you learn how [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2092.26s)]
*  to represent and model action through narrative and and to learn and absorb new behavioral models [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2098.1800000000003s)]
*  through language alone and then finally you learn to extract concepts and principles from those [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2104.82s)]
*  particularities and then not just individuals but you can back it out a little further our social [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2110.5s)]
*  groups human beings as groups had to make our way through these stages as well again we didn't just [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2117.78s)]
*  climb out of the trees onto the savanna and start speculating about the nature of love or the [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2125.38s)]
*  fundamental substance of the universe that's not how it worked the aboriginal groups i mentioned a [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2130.26s)]
*  minute ago had completely different problems to solve and few if any of them required abstract [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2135.3s)]
*  theoretical cognition very early on you know think about it a paleolithic band of hunter-gatherers [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2142.5s)]
*  take take a group like that and consider what they need to know in order to make their way in the [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2148.82s)]
*  world they've got to remember how to start fires how to cook food how to find water how to fish [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2154.42s)]
*  how to make baskets you know maybe their local group is 50 100 individuals so it's very plausible [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2161.46s)]
*  that they could forget these things if they're not really taking steps to make sure that they're [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2168.26s)]
*  reinforced and so the ritual cycle of these very simple band societies you you know you wouldn't [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2173.14s)]
*  want to call the ritual cycle secular certainly not but but their focus tends to be very practical [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2181.14s)]
*  very often when anthropologists and ethnographers ask such people why they do things a certain way [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2186.74s)]
*  you know why do you make baskets this way why do you do following a certain way they they often this [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2193.2999999999997s)]
*  has always fascinated me they get this puzzled look and some version of because this is how our [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2198.02s)]
*  people do it as if no other explanation is necessary or even imaginable because why would [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2203.7s)]
*  those people ever have needed to articulate it beyond that language itself evolves and expands [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2210.98s)]
*  to meet the specific needs of a people and as it expands it's pushing out the walls and filling in [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2217.94s)]
*  the details of their cultural world and each individual's subjective inner life and i want [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2223.06s)]
*  to say that again because i think it's very important you know we started off when we did [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2230.02s)]
*  started off when we did climb out of the trees onto the savannah we first started speaking you [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2235.54s)]
*  know i don't know how that exactly played out whether it was first through commands or or who [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2240.9s)]
*  knows but we started with a very small vocabulary and thus a very very limited and dim subjectivity [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2247.14s)]
*  and as the language expanded to meet our new needs our internal cognitive world and the cultural [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2254.66s)]
*  world that we all share expanded and filled out as well we create our cultures and our cultures [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2261.78s)]
*  create us and for most of us we receive a lot more than we put in when we think of culture we [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2268.1800000000003s)]
*  usually think of art and architecture music and dance you know religion and ritual but but those [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2276.1000000000004s)]
*  things aren't interesting just for their own sake the social purpose of all that stuff is to serve [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2283.3s)]
*  as a kind of substrate in which a certain kind of human being can grow and thrive [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2288.98s)]
*  the shared biological and early developmental experiences at the very base of that pyramid that [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2298.18s)]
*  i started off with those experiences provide the raw material but most of what makes us interesting [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2302.7400000000002s)]
*  is informed by culture and so [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2309.62s)]
*  let me let me rephrase that most of what makes us different is informed by culture and so we wonder [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2313.7799999999997s)]
*  how wide the field is for possible modes of individual and shared human experience how [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2321.62s)]
*  different can we be you know we all know that we're working off of fairly similar biological and [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2328.18s)]
*  developmental substructure but the superstructure we build on top of that that culture constructs [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2336.1s)]
*  for us and the inner life that culture informs for us how different can those things be i think they [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2342.02s)]
*  can be very very radically different you know we know for example certainly that the inner life of [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2350.74s)]
*  an individual comes in all shapes and sizes and that's the reason why we're so interested in [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2358.98s)]
*  the interior world of a person peeking on psilocybin mushrooms is a very different world [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2366.34s)]
*  from that of somebody that's soberly commuting to the office on a wednesday morning [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2372.82s)]
*  we know that dreaming is nothing like waking life and yet nevertheless it's an entirely convincing [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2378.18s)]
*  experience while it's happening we know that people living with autism or schizophrenia are not just [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2384.26s)]
*  behaviorally affected but that their subjectivity itself is somehow profoundly alien to common [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2389.86s)]
*  experience in the profane world for most of us if you really want some examples of the far reaches [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2396.02s)]
*  of the worlds we build out for ourselves go read some of oliver sacks books you know dr sacks was [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2402.7400000000002s)]
*  this neurologist brilliant neurologist you frequently encountered people with well i mean [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2408.1800000000003s)]
*  it really opens your eyes to how widely our subjective experience can vary on the individual [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2414.7400000000002s)]
*  level one patient that he writes about in one of his books his nervous system was under attack [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2419.06s)]
*  by a virus and so he had lost all memory except of music and his wife he could play the piano and [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2425.2999999999997s)]
*  he knew and recognized his wife and then the things that he had learned through mimicry [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2431.2999999999997s)]
*  right so uh he could play the piano he could still speak he could do certain motor function things he [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2436.74s)]
*  could uh you know he could use a pencil and he could do these behavioral things that he had learned [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2442.98s)]
*  in a behavioral way but conceptual memories and it's all of it was gone and on top of that he had [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2447.38s)]
*  lost his ability to create any new memories okay every 30 seconds or so and any new experiences he [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2455.2200000000003s)]
*  had were completely gone and suddenly he'd be overcome by this sensation absolutely convincing [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2461.7000000000003s)]
*  and emotionally overwhelming he'd be overcome by the sensation or you might even say he was [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2468.26s)]
*  overcome by this revelation that he had only just now for the first time ever become conscious [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2474.1s)]
*  every 30 seconds or so he would be overwhelmed by this feeling and you know became an obsession [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2480.18s)]
*  for him and finally he's filling up dozens of journals with notes to himself like 8 31 am [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2487.06s)]
*  now i am really completely awake and then that line is crossed out and followed by another entry [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2492.34s)]
*  906 am now i am perfectly overwhelmingly awake and then that's crossed out followed by 9 34 am [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2497.86s)]
*  now i am superlatively actually awake and so on sax writes quote every few minutes the [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2505.54s)]
*  rapture of having just become conscious would overwhelm him and compel him to record the moment [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2513.86s)]
*  a few times when he couldn't find the diary right away he grabbed a pen and recorded his [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2519.2200000000003s)]
*  epiphany on walls or furniture but since he'd only just woken up just now old entries were [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2523.06s)]
*  clearly fake hence he struck them out end quote you know the thing to keep in mind is that this [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2528.82s)]
*  is not just a guy outwardly exhibiting odd behaviors there is an interior subjective [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2535.62s)]
*  experience that goes along with those behaviors to ask what it would take for somebody to behave [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2542.34s)]
*  that way you have to ask what is his inner life like it's not like yours and mine [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2548.74s)]
*  sax worked with another man who had had brain surgery and afterward he had no feeling at all [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2554.8999999999996s)]
*  for his family including his wife and daughters nothing he felt nothing for them but he suddenly [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2560.2599999999998s)]
*  felt overwhelming trust and love and affection for every stranger he met sax wrote an article in [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2565.14s)]

*  faces she would she would see them transform into dragons before her eyes complete with pointy ears [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2578.34s)]
*  black or green scaly skin you know large eyes and a protruding snout i mean she would see it and it [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2586.1000000000004s)]

*  hiding in cracks and corners and stuff like that and now she'd grown up in a culture that [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2604.42s)]
*  gave her a set of baseline assumptions against which she could compare her vision of dragons [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2609.3s)]
*  right so she could recognize that this was a strange experience and that maybe she needed [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2613.38s)]
*  to get some help but the images themselves were working overtime to go right by her critical [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2618.1800000000003s)]
*  thinking you know impressing their actual reality on her very powerfully they were that convincing [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2623.54s)]
*  and so what would it have been like if she had not been born into a culture that said there's no [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2629.22s)]
*  such thing as dragons what has she been born to a culture where dragons were completely expected [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2633.4599999999996s)]
*  to exist or that the possibility was at least allowed for maybe in that case she just lives in [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2637.62s)]
*  a world where sometimes people turn into dragons and sometimes dragons come to visit her and just [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2645.54s)]
*  that's that that's how the world works and maybe the tendency to see something like that in in a [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2650.3399999999997s)]
*  society like that would be a little bit less repressed so you get a subgroup of magical [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2655.86s)]
*  seers who are all able to detect the dragons when they're around or you know let's let's try [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2660.5s)]
*  something closer to home maybe for most of us today we all live in a culture where we're taught [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2665.46s)]
*  about this phenomenon called thinking we all know what thinking is we're taught about it and we're [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2670.1s)]
*  taught that the little voice in our head is something called a thought right so we're not [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2674.9s)]
*  alarmed when a little voice in our head starts speaking even though it's not a thought it's [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2680.34s)]
*  all we really know all we subjectively experience is that there's a voice in our head speaking to [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2686.26s)]
*  us we don't know where it's located we don't know where the content of what it's saying comes from [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2691.1400000000003s)]
*  because it's not like we're able to select our thoughts before they come well imagine you grew [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2696.42s)]
*  up in a culture where all you had ever been told right from the time you you crawled out of the [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2700.5s)]
*  womb all you'd ever been told was that that voice in your head is a god or a spirit communicating [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2706.6600000000003s)]
*  with you how would you know any different and what basis would you have to even speculate [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2713.06s)]
*  differently and how would that affect your entire understanding and subsequent experience in the [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2718.82s)]
*  world and i think we have to recognize that if you had grown up like that you would not just be the [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2726.2599999999998s)]
*  same person you are now except that you know you're mistakenly believe that you communicate with [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2734.18s)]
*  gods and spirits your entire orientation in the world would be radically different [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2738.9s)]
*  your entire idea of how the world works and how it's structured you know not just your behaviors [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2745.38s)]
*  or conscious beliefs but the very structure of your of your subjective inner world would be [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2749.7000000000003s)]
*  altered by the assumption for example that that there was no inner private chamber in your mind [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2755.7000000000003s)]
*  that was private kept to yourself but that your being was somehow porous that was being prodded [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2762.58s)]
*  and spoken to and penetrated by these other beings that could crawl into your into your you [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2768.18s)]
*  know into your mind you'd be living in a reality populated with these hidden beings that interacted [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2772.74s)]
*  regularly with you in your daily life and kind of directed you around and told you what to do [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2777.8599999999997s)]
*  how different would your entire world picture and the world picture of your people have developed [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2782.74s)]
*  if that one explanation for a general experience an explanation that is as good as any other for [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2788.74s)]

*  and psychology we are far from being able to tell you why your consciousness is structured just the [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2803.1400000000003s)]
*  way it is or why one thought is presented to the mind instead of some other thought i mean you have [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2808.1000000000004s)]
*  to resort to phenomenology to get any reasonable or even plausible take on why and how we select [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2812.7400000000002s)]
*  from among the various sense data that are out there choosing and discarding from among this [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2818.9s)]
*  just this infinite soup of incoming information to to build a world in which we can meaningfully act [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2823.86s)]
*  let alone we don't even understand that we don't even come close to understanding this this thing [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2829.86s)]
*  that you know this this way that we jack into each other's minds and share a symbolic world that we [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2836.9s)]
*  call our culture this is very complicated stuff and we don't understand it very well [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2841.54s)]
*  we asked what culture was before we discussed how widely individual human experiences can vary [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2846.98s)]
*  human beings share the innate sociability of other great apes but with the advent of language we [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2853.7s)]
*  discovered a whole new realm of social life that is completely inaccessible to other animals it's [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2859.22s)]
*  inaccessible to all flesh if you want to put it that way right this this new cultural world animals [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2864.1s)]
*  can can wrestle and chase each other around and interact and in those various ways but human [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2870.34s)]
*  beings have opened out into this entirely new realm of experience where you know we we all are [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2874.5s)]
*  sort of locked into this linguistic cultural world now where we can tell each other stories we can [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2880.34s)]
*  create and bat around concepts with one another we can come up with mathematics we can we can [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2886.26s)]
*  you know and share experiences that we've had we can all of these things that that we can interact [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2892.26s)]
*  with other human beings on a completely different plane now [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2898.42s)]
*  we said that culture is not just the art and architecture and so forth but that these are only [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2902.1s)]
*  cultures outward markers and we build a physical culture around us kind of like a [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2906.74s)]
*  i don't know like a symbolic biodome right where children are all reared on certain stories [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2913.2999999999997s)]
*  they're reared in dwellings that are organized both internally and relative to one another [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2919.22s)]
*  in ways that imply a certain family and community arrangement you know they're all reared on [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2923.86s)]
*  family and community arrangement you know there are going to be certain styles of entertainment [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2930.02s)]
*  and art that carry information not just in their content but in their form right the point of all [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2933.86s)]
*  this is to create a certain kind of human being and to make sure that that human type survives over [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2940.1s)]
*  time everything grows all these individual manifestations grow out of a budding cultural [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2946.2599999999998s)]
*  soul and those outward manifestations are all fragmentary symbols of that soul [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2952.82s)]
*  you can reverse engineer those manifestations to get a glimpse into what those people were like [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2960.1s)]
*  and i think the most engaging thing about history for me the thing that really woke me up and [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2964.98s)]
*  and brought the world beyond my immediate concerns out into the light for me [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2969.06s)]
*  was realizing that everything everything is a symbol everything is is uh is a shard of glass [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2972.9s)]
*  from the window into someone else's soul you know it matters that the first axiom of western [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2982.2599999999998s)]
*  philosophy is i think therefore i am putting the subjective experience of the atomic individual at [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2989.38s)]
*  the center of everything that matters it matters that that same culture rejected the social [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=2995.46s)]
*  institutions of the catholic church as the means of salvation instead looking to the individual [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3001.06s)]
*  human conscience and it's not a coincidence that this individualistic culture discovered and [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3006.58s)]
*  perfected say perspectival painting right which is a painting of a scene as it's viewed from the [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3012.1800000000003s)]
*  perspective of an individual observer right with a vanishing point and all that and it's not a [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3018.18s)]
*  coincidence that this culture adopted the novel as a characteristic art form you go back and tragedy [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3023.54s)]
*  and epic reforms that were intended to be experienced with other people they're public art forms [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3030.4199999999996s)]
*  but a novel is read in silence by an individual who is reading you know the novel shines a light [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3035.94s)]
*  into the inner life of another person so you have a you have an individual person in silence reading [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3043.3s)]
*  the inner thoughts of another person it's a profoundly individualistic art form our modern [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3047.94s)]
*  political forms enshrine the individual the architecture of our homes and the layout of [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3054.34s)]
*  our neighborhoods tells you about the nuclear family structure you don't have to adopt any [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3058.5800000000004s)]
*  particular interpretation of any of these symbols but the physical and intellectual culture of a [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3064.02s)]
*  society i think on a very deep level they're all held together in one great symphony but each part [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3069.3s)]
*  provides us information about what kind of human beings that culture is trying to grow [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3076.5800000000004s)]
*  that's the approach that i take to historical and cultural phenomena and it might be insufficiently [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3082.9s)]
*  rigorous for some people maybe but you know i'm not a historian and it's a lot more fun so [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3088.1000000000004s)]
*  you know here's the thing eventually you just start to notice little things [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3094.98s)]
*  you notice that the early european poets of beowulf for example seem to have a lot more in common [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3100.1800000000003s)]
*  with the greeks of homer than they do with the romans as we find them in marcus aurelius or [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3105.46s)]
*  seneca even though you know those latter writers are much closer to the writers of beowulf than [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3110.34s)]
*  than the homeric writers were meanwhile marcus aurelius and seneca you you can read those today and [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3117.46s)]
*  their mentality is so so so recognizable that they might as well have been reading it last week [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3125.54s)]
*  you know it's as if both cultures the classical greco roman and the west european [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3132.8199999999997s)]
*  have independent life courses and that they're more similar to each other at each stage than they are [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3137.4599999999996s)]
*  to themselves at different stages right in the way that two children are more similar to one another [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3144.66s)]
*  than they are to the future adult versions of themselves and i should say again that um i hope [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3149.78s)]
*  this series this series has got to be interpreted as an impressionistic work [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3157.1400000000003s)]
*  okay not as a pursuit of axioms or historical law [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3162.02s)]
*  you know we're going to do a lot of speculating and playing around with ideas and kind of throwing [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3167.5400000000004s)]
*  things out there and batting them around we'll see what happens um you can't understand history [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3172.1000000000004s)]
*  through law dead forms can be described by law but living systems have to be understood by analogy [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3177.54s)]
*  understanding living systems always has this element of participation involved right of [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3184.82s)]
*  of having a feel for it we have a tendency to want to reduce everything down to a list of rules but [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3189.62s)]
*  it just doesn't work like that with a system that's still in the process of becoming [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3196.34s)]
*  and so when talking about a people like the aztecs one of the unfortunate historical [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3202.18s)]
*  situations where christians got their grimy mitts on another people's library before anyone [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3206.98s)]
*  got a chance to copy it down so you know we don't have much in the way of direct sources when you're [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3211.14s)]
*  dealing with something like this we might be able to draw on other historical examples to get some [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3215.94s)]
*  kind of a feel for the character of the society and the individuals that it was creating we might [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3220.82s)]
*  notice for example that the aztecs were positioned relative to the maya and the existing mesoamerican [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3227.22s)]
*  societies similarly in many ways to the way the romans were positioned relative to the greeks [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3233.46s)]
*  or the ottoman turks to the existing muslim world to the americans to old europe you know in each [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3239.54s)]
*  case you've got an ancient culture of almost unbelievable richness and spontaneous creativity [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3245.3s)]
*  that just seems to spring right out of the earth throwing out historical novelties so profound that [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3251.3s)]
*  they inspire entire civilizations and they draw in surrounding tribal peoples for participation [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3258.1s)]
*  right these young cultures all collapse or exhaust themselves through internecine conflict and then [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3263.54s)]
*  they're inherited by people that they consider to be kind of rough barbarians the greeks exhausted [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3269.86s)]
*  themselves in the peloponnesian wars and socrates and uriptes were were well into their project of [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3276.66s)]
*  deconstructing the fundamental institutions and ideas on which athenian society had been built [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3282.02s)]
*  when first the macedonians and then the romans pretty much just inherited a culture realm that [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3287.54s)]
*  had stood up to imperial threats for centuries but now could hardly even be bothered to defend [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3293.3s)]
*  itself even though even though the greeks resented the rule of both the macedonians and the romans [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3297.94s)]
*  they considered to be vulgar warrior peoples kind of unworthy of their high culture [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3302.58s)]
*  when rome wanted culture it imported greeks to provide it for them i mean even roman masterpieces [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3308.58s)]
*  like like virgil's and needed and havids metamorphosis are very obviously derivative of greek forms [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3313.7s)]
*  nothing really new in islamic civilization emerged from the ottoman empire not really [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3320.3399999999997s)]
*  after those tribal warriors come down from the steppe and overwhelm the muslim world that [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3325.54s)]
*  you know very recently devastated by the mongols and of course the united states this is something [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3330.02s)]
*  that people talk about a lot you know like the previous two examples were really good at war [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3335.8599999999997s)]
*  we're great engineers and builders we're outstanding administrators but if we want high [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3340.34s)]
*  culture what do we do we look to europe whose geopolitical position we inherited after they [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3344.82s)]
*  bled themselves dry in two world wars that left them questioning their own foundations [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3350.5s)]
*  so this is something that's kind of similar in the myth of sisyphus camus tells us that the only [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3355.78s)]
*  really important philosophical question is whether or not commit suicide the greeks and arabs were in [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3360.82s)]
*  a similar naval gazing period for similar reasons when the younger simpler more vigorous romans and [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3366.82s)]
*  ottomans came in and said just like the americans after world war ii fine if you guys don't want it [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3372.34s)]
*  i guess we'll take it well now the aztecs were also great engineers amazing engineers actually [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3377.78s)]
*  we're going to talk more about that later but they were great warriors great you know empire [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3383.54s)]
*  administrators but we don't see much from them in terms of truly novel culture forms [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3388.34s)]
*  they seem to be doing their best impression of the existing culture forms just as the romans kind [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3392.82s)]
*  of ape the greeks the ottomans ape the abbasids and the americans the european each of them copying [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3397.54s)]
*  basically what had gone before and making up for the lack of originality through you know a sort [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3403.38s)]
*  of vulgar gigantism just do more of it make it bigger so i think an idea like this you know you [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3408.1800000000003s)]
*  can't take it too seriously but it might give us a way to approach the aztecs that i'm sure you [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3416.1800000000003s)]
*  know the aztecs that allows us to extract some understanding that isn't immediately available [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3421.86s)]
*  from direct sources it's just a way of approaching it of course you got to be careful coming at things [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3426.42s)]
*  this way you can't mistake the map for the territory you have to keep in mind that it's [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3431.94s)]
*  just a heuristic but there is information in there as long as we can remember that we're dealing with [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3435.54s)]
*  analogies not laws something that can give us a feel for the thing not to provide us an instruction [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3440.42s)]
*  manual now i'm going to slow things down a little bit and take us into the final stretch of this [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3446.26s)]
*  meandering introduction by talking about mythology one of the most useful ways to triangulate the [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3453.38s)]
*  similarities and differences between cultures is through their mythologies and so yeah i'll [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3462.0200000000004s)]
*  spend the rest of the time here talking about that just a bit so this will lead us into what [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3466.5s)]
*  i'm doing in the next two real episodes nicely i think so when you see a mythological motif that [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3473.86s)]
*  seems to be spread across the world and through time you find it in mythologies and cultures and [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3482.6600000000003s)]
*  continents and eras from front to back through world history when you see a motif that seems [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3486.7400000000002s)]
*  to maintain itself through time and across cultures like that i think you can be pretty [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3492.02s)]
*  sure that you're dealing with an expression of those primordial human experiences that we were [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3497.2200000000003s)]
*  talking about earlier or at least if it's not necessarily an expression of them it doesn't [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3503.54s)]
*  contradict them it resonates with them speaks to them the question of whether various mythological [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3509.7799999999997s)]
*  complexes developed independently or through a long process of diffusion is something that has [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3516.58s)]
*  divided anthropologists for years and american scholars usually fall very hard on the side of [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3520.9s)]
*  parallel independent development but however these similar motifs came to be found in [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3526.02s)]
*  these environments as apparently separate as madagascar and north america the similarities [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3532.3399999999997s)]
*  are certainly there there are certain things that you find just across the world and throughout time [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3537.2999999999997s)]
*  in various mythologies unquestionable similarities and they point to the possibility that aspects [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3543.54s)]
*  of both the form and the content of these various constellations of symbols again resonate with [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3550.1s)]
*  certain features of individual and and social experience i mean what are we to make of [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3555.78s)]
*  a widespread and complicated motif like like the virgin mother and her son that you find all over [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3563.7000000000003s)]
*  the place or the primordial dueling brothers usually one murders the other that you find that [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3569.3s)]
*  all over the place the conquest and slang of the great watery serpent by the celestial gods and [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3574.34s)]
*  then the universe itself built out of its disarticulated corpse that's all over the place [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3580.42s)]
*  you know what do you make of that or take for example and now i'll appeal to joseph campbell [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3585.22s)]
*  the well-known classical myth of demeter hekate and percephene and the less well-known indonesian [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3591.7s)]
*  myths and rites of satin rubia and hanauele the 19th century english mythologist sir james frazier [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3597.7s)]
*  speaking a british mythologist i'm sorry speaking in support of the idea of cultural diffusion [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3605.8599999999997s)]
*  um the idea that that these myths actually spread across the world and weren't developed in similar [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3612.8999999999996s)]
*  ways independently he said that the symbols in play in the classical and indonesian myths that [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3618.4199999999996s)]
*  we're about to talk about were so remarkable and and so exactly similar that they just couldn't be [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3625.46s)]
*  the result of chance and they couldn't be the result of what he called the effect of similar [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3632.74s)]
*  causes acting on the similar constitutions of the human mind in different countries and under [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3637.78s)]
*  different skies he said that's just not possible they're too close there has to be a connection [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3642.5800000000004s)]
*  here and so i'll let the american mythologist joseph campbell tell the classical version this [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3646.42s)]
*  is the story of percephene demeter and hekate quote percephene who was known as corey the maiden or [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3652.7400000000002s)]
*  the virgin was conceived of zeus her mother was demeter the creten goddess of agriculture and [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3662.26s)]
*  the fruitful soil so pay attention to that kind of stuff like what the gods and goddesses particularly [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3668.9s)]
*  are associated with because it's very important i'll start over quote percephene was also known [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3673.78s)]
*  as corey the maiden or the virgin she was conceived of zeus her mother was demeter the creten goddess [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3679.6200000000003s)]
*  of agriculture and of the fruitful soil and the maiden was playing we are told in a meadow [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3686.26s)]
*  culling flowers with the daughters of okianus the great all-embracing sea when she spied a [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3691.78s)]
*  glorious plant with hundred blossoms spreading its fragrance all about which had been sent up [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3698.02s)]
*  expressly to seduce her by the goddess earth gaia at the behest of hades the lord of the underworld [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3702.5s)]
*  so that when she hurried to pluck its flowers the earth gaped and a great god appeared in a chariot [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3708.7400000000002s)]
*  of gold who carried her down into his abyss despite her cries the god was hades lord of the [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3713.3s)]
*  underworld and in the land of the dead she became his queen percephene's cries had been heard only [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3719.14s)]
*  by demeter her mother and hekate a goddess of the moon but when the mother bereaved sought to trace [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3725.46s)]
*  her daughter she found that her footprints had been obliterated by those of a pig for it had [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3732.3399999999997s)]
*  chanced most curiously that at the time of percephene's abduction a herd of pigs had been [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3737.46s)]
*  rooting in the neighborhood and the swineherds name euboleus means the giver of good counsel [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3742.9s)]
*  and was in earlier times an appellation of the god of the underworld himself [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3749.22s)]
*  furthermore when the earth opened to receive percephene those pigs fell into the chasm too [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3754.2599999999998s)]
*  and that we are told is why pigs play such an important role in the rites of demeter and [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3759.46s)]
*  percephene in a festival celebrated in memory of the sorrows and later joy of demeter and [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3764.02s)]
*  percephene suckling pigs were offered in a manner suggestive not only of an earlier human sacrifice [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3769.8599999999997s)]
*  but one of precisely the gruesome kind that we have observed in africa and among the merind anim [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=3775.94s)]

*  what is the meaning of the elevated host of the mass as in the play logic or dream logic of any [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4004.1000000000004s)]
*  traditional religious pageant the sacred object is to be identified at least for the moment of [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4011.1400000000003s)]
*  the ceremony with the god the cut stalk is the return persephone who was dead but now livid in [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4016.02s)]
*  the grain itself a bronze gong was struck at this moment a young priestess representing [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4022.5s)]
*  corey herself appeared and the pageant terminated with a pine of joy end quote [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4029.54s)]
*  now the parallels here to the christian mythology probably don't even need to be stated but i'll [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4036.02s)]
*  state them anyway they're pretty unmistakable right you've got the virgin persephone [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4040.66s)]
*  something that's not mentioned in the part of the story i just told the virgin persephone's son [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4046.58s)]
*  who was conceived in her by her father zeus her son was dianysius dianysius is the god of among [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4050.58s)]
*  other things bread and wine just as jesus of nazareth the transformer of water into wine [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4057.14s)]
*  and the multiplier of loaves of bread and whose right whose primary right involves the consecration [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4062.9s)]
*  of bread and wine which are said to transmute into the literal presence of the lord just as the cut [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4069.2999999999997s)]
*  stalk of grain was to represent the literal presence of persephone and he was also the son [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4073.94s)]
*  of the virgin mary just like dianysius is the son of the virgin persephone and the father god of heaven [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4079.86s)]
*  conceived in the virgin to give birth to this you know to this god of bread and wine obviously very [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4086.6600000000003s)]
*  very you know clear parallels there in the greek instance it's the maiden mother who descends into [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4093.94s)]
*  the underworld in the christian it's her son the culture hero and that's not a neutral difference [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4099.860000000001s)]
*  but we'll get to that in an episode where it's relevant in the greek version the mother is [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4104.1s)]
*  resurrected as the staple wheat crop in the christian version the son is resurrected as [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4108.66s)]
*  the metaphysical bread of life right and even the primordial event that initiated the whole [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4112.9s)]
*  cycle in both stories was the lord of the underworld using a plant to tempt the maiden [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4120.5s)]
*  into his clutches right if it feels like we're missing one of the key ingredients to the story [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4125.94s)]
*  persephone's mother demeter is actually associated with serpents her chariot is supposed to have been [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4131.78s)]
*  pulled by two serpents just as the serpent in the garden pulled eve forward into consciousness [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4136.42s)]
*  and from there mankind into history from the mediterranean and mesopotamian worlds [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4141.22s)]
*  we're talking about here you move east now that area of the aegean sea in the east mediterranean [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4150.66s)]
*  mythological complex we're going to head east over into the indonesian islands in that cultural [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4157.14s)]
*  complex and we find an intact myth in west saran a large island just west of new guinea [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4162.02s)]
*  and very very similar in structure as you'll see here in a moment [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4169.22s)]
*  and uh except this centers around a maiden called hainu elei the frond of the coco palm [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4174.34s)]
*  and so i'll go back to joseph campbell because nobody tells these stories like he does quote [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4180.1s)]
*  nine families of mankind came forth in the beginning from mount nunusaku where the people [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4185.46s)]
*  had emerged from clusters of bananas and these families stopped in west seram at a place known [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4190.42s)]
*  as the nine dance grounds which is in the jungle between ahiolo and verloin now there was a man [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4196.18s)]
*  among them whose name was a meta meaning dark black or night and neither was he married nor [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4202.9s)]
*  had he children he went off one day hunting with his dog and after a little while the dog smelt a [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4208.58s)]
*  wild pig which it traced to a pond into which the animal took flight but the dog remained on the [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4214.74s)]
*  shore and the pig swimming grew tired and drowned but the man who had arrived meanwhile retrieved it [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4219.94s)]
*  and he found a coconut on its tusk though at that time there were no coco palms in the world [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4227.7s)]
*  returning to his hut a made a place the nut on a stand and covered it with a cloth bearing a [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4233.46s)]
*  snake design and they lay down to sleep and in the night there appeared to him the figure of a man [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4238.339999999999s)]
*  who said the coconut that you placed upon the stand and covered with a cloth you must plant [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4244.099999999999s)]
*  in the earth otherwise it won't grow so it made a plant to the coconut the next morning and in [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4249.06s)]
*  three days the palm was tall again three days and it was bearing blossoms he climbed the tree to cut [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4256.1s)]
*  the blossoms from which he wished to prepare himself a drink but as he cut he slashed his finger [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4261.780000000001s)]
*  and the blood fell on a leaf he returned home to bandage his finger and in three days came back to [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4267.3s)]
*  the palm to find that where the blood on the leaf had mingled with the sap of the cut blossom the [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4273.3s)]
*  face of someone had appeared three days later the trunk of the person was there and when he returned [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4277.94s)]
*  again in three days he found that a little girl had developed from his drop of blood [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4283.94s)]
*  that night the same figure of a man appeared to him in a dream take your cloth with the snake design [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4289.139999999999s)]
*  he said wrap the girl of the coco palm in the cloth carefully and carry her home [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4294.82s)]
*  so the next morning amita went with his cloth to the coco palm climbed the tree and carefully [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4300.58s)]
*  wrapped the little girl he descended cautiously took her home and named her hanaway le she grew [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4305.94s)]
*  quickly and in three days was a nubile maiden but she was not like an ordinary person for when she [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4313.46s)]
*  would answer the call of nature her excrement consisted of all sorts of valuable articles [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4319.54s)]
*  such as dishes and gongs so that her father became very rich and about that time there was to be [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4323.7s)]
*  celebrated in the place of the nine dance grounds a great morrow dance which was to last nine full [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4329.78s)]
*  nights and the nine families of mankind were all to participate now when the people danced the [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4335.54s)]

*  second night the nine families of mankind assembled on the second ground from when the [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4360.5s)]
*  morrow is celebrated it must be performed each night at a different place and once again it was [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4365.06s)]

*  they came together and discussed the matter they were all extremely jealous that hanaway le could [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4418.099999999999s)]

*  is killed an event which is represented very directly in the west saram myth and figuratively [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4696.9800000000005s)]
*  in the classical story represented by you know persephone's descent into the underworld and yet [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4701.9400000000005s)]
*  the murdered maiden becomes the important food stuffs that are depended on by the people once [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4707.38s)]
*  she's brought back or that you could rather say that that's the form in which she's brought back [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4712.900000000001s)]
*  so there seems to be a culture complex or at least a thread possibly interweaved with others [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4719.780000000001s)]
*  extending from madagascar north along the coast of africa east africa cross-pollinating with [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4727.46s)]
*  existing forms in egypt in the middle east before moving along the northern shores of [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4733.46s)]
*  the indian ocean until we see this constellation of symbols which although they might be strung [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4737.46s)]
*  together by different narratives or organized differently relative to one another the symbols [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4743.14s)]
*  themselves keep popping up consistently in myths all along this route of human migration [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4749.06s)]
*  and so in addition to the symbol systems you know there are there are cultural and linguistic [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4756.74s)]
*  forms that seem to bear out an ancient connection pretty clearly this this austronesian [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4761.62s)]
*  realm let's say so for example if you want to count to 10 in malagasy the traditional [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4766.34s)]
*  language of madagascar you would say isa rua tele ephatra limi that's one through five if you [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4771.94s)]
*  move along that route to indonesia and count in malay you'll say instead of isa rua tele [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4777.78s)]
*  you'll say [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4785.14s)]
*  pretty close or you keep going in javanese it's very similar and as the people hopped into their [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4788.74s)]
*  long canoes and started to brave the pacific ocean you go out into polynesia a place like [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4797.62s)]
*  samoa and you're counting off in lima so again take it all the way back to madagascar [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4802.74s)]
*  down off the southeastern coast of africa and you'll say again you'll say isa rua tele [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4810.820000000001s)]
*  ephatra limi we're all the way out in samoa in the pacific ocean you've got tassi lua tolu [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4816.660000000001s)]
*  fa lima very very similar this this austronesian language group as it's called it transmutes over [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4822.1s)]
*  time as languages always do you know old english looks and sounds like german pig latin to a modern [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4828.820000000001s)]
*  english speaker but the lineage is very well established well the myths and symbols that [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4834.9800000000005s)]
*  structure the culture worlds went along with the language and they morph and transmute somewhat too [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4839.7s)]
*  but they maintain a recognizable common structure and given how deep into history we have to go to [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4846.179999999999s)]
*  locate this migration we've got to be dealing with a set of motifs that are almost unimaginably [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4853.3s)]
*  ancient and yet held in mind by traveling human bands and societies as they make their way across [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4858.099999999999s)]
*  the globe it brings to mind something i read although i can't remember where [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4863.94s)]
*  that culture has always changed just enough to allow them to remain the same [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4869.86s)]
*  i can't remember where i heard that but it's a good saying you know humans are supposed to have [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4874.099999999999s)]
*  made it to australia almost 50 over 50 000 years ago and in fact we find a bunch of parallel motifs [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4878.82s)]
*  among the aboriginal tribes like the aranda in australia so so i mean these are connections [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4886.339999999999s)]
*  that go way way way back they're things that we share pretty much universally and they speak [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4891.14s)]
*  to things that we share as human beings the really ingenious part of of what these people did is how [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4898.1s)]
*  our ancestors altered the symbols over time to better fit their environments and experience [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4905.54s)]
*  while still maintaining the core structure over what had to have been tens of thousands of years [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4910.58s)]
*  for example when you start getting out into polynesia where there are no snakes right they've [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4915.78s)]
*  got these this whole mythological cycle that has snakes at you know various critical points and now [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4920.74s)]
*  they live in polynesia and there's no snakes they just switched it out with an eel the the role of [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4927.0599999999995s)]
*  the serpent was just swapped out with an eel no big deal you know in the polynesian case you have [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4932.099999999999s)]
*  something like a maiden named henna is married or otherwise joined to an eel and then they have [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4938.26s)]
*  and she's again associated with the moon that three-way constellation between woman serpent and [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4945.7s)]
*  moon is found all over the world the woman is the consort of the serpent both of them associated [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4951.86s)]
*  with the moon you can go out to southern france you have something like the venus of la salle [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4956.58s)]
*  which is a paleolithic carving from 25 000 years ago that was you know again found in southern france [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4962.18s)]
*  and it shows a pregnant woman an obviously pregnant woman touching her belly with one hand [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4970.0199999999995s)]
*  and holding up a crescent with 13 lines scratched into it so it's very i mean you look at it's very [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4976.339999999999s)]
*  obviously demonstrating that there's an awareness that these people had of the connection between [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4983.46s)]
*  the cycles of the moon and the timing of the menstrual cycle of which there are 13 iterations [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4988.0199999999995s)]
*  each year i mean it's very obviously pointing to that knowledge the woman sheds and regenerates [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4992.339999999999s)]
*  her uterine lining as the moon is emptied and refilled with light on the same on the same [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=4999.7s)]
*  time frame the serpent is renewed by the shedding of its skin and so you know there are certain [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5005.38s)]
*  things like that you can point to as to why they might be associated but you look at the mythologies [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5011.7s)]
*  across the world and there's no question that those three things are frequently associated [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5015.78s)]
*  the connection between the moon and the tides was also made very early and women break water to [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5022.82s)]
*  inaugurate their labors so you have that you've got the waving motion of the serpent that can [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5027.54s)]
*  be associated with the water the earliest bronze age mythologies seem to have venerated this [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5033.38s)]
*  mythological cycle and revered the goddess mother primarily but when the patriarchal warriors of [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5039.94s)]
*  the arian steppe in the semitic desert conquered these bronze age civilizations they inverted that [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5044.42s)]
*  symbol system to create the mother serpent of the primordial sea such as leviathan or tiomat [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5050.82s)]
*  representatives of blind unconscious nature and darkness and chaos and who once the gods [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5056.98s)]
*  ordered that there must be light you know in consciousness looked out and surveilled the world [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5064.74s)]
*  those those mother goddess serpents you know that the dark watery moon associated mother goddess [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5070.179999999999s)]
*  were slaughtered and order was created by the conscious rearrangement of their remains or in [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5076.98s)]
*  the classical world where we find a figure like medusa the snake woman who is associated with the [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5082.66s)]
*  moon and who in her original form wore a mask painted red to represent the mysterious power of [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5087.78s)]
*  menstrual blood i mean these things are all over the place sometimes you have them combined into [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5093.86s)]
*  one person like medusa you have the goddess the snakes who's associated with the moon all [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5098.42s)]
*  condensed down to one thing and that's the way you have to be able to read mythology if you see [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5103.3s)]
*  say a virgin mother and then the father god right something we see in christianity and in egypt with [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5108.5s)]
*  isis and osiris and horus and all these things you have to look at that as a united symbol [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5115.78s)]
*  there are things you can pull apart from them and that's you know that's why they are pulled apart [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5121.14s)]
*  in some stories to emphasize certain aspects of each but that thing by itself all of those things [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5124.74s)]
*  together is a symbol and you have to be able to look at it that way too you find something very [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5130.42s)]
*  similar as you keep on going out into india where indo-european warriors swept down to conquer [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5135.54s)]
*  the existing dravidian peoples and the parallels between medusa on one hand and the indian goddess [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5141.62s)]
*  kali are completely unmistakable down to tight details i mean um you know we read that asclepius [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5148.34s)]
*  the god of healing in ancient greece is supposed to have taken blood from medusa after she was [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5155.06s)]
*  killed drawing some blood from her left side and some from her right and the blood from her left [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5160.0199999999995s)]
*  is supposed to have have had the power to kill while the blood from her right side is supposed [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5165.14s)]
*  to have had the power to cure and revive from death meanwhile kali the hindu goddess of the new [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5170.26s)]
*  moon who is the consort of the serpent god shiva mirrors medusa and virtually all of her representations [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5177.14s)]
*  by brandishing a death-dealing sword in her left hand and a gift or boon of some kind in her right [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5183.860000000001s)]
*  hand and so i mean there's it's so exact and so specific that there's clearly some kind of a [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5189.0599999999995s)]
*  connection there otherwise you have to otherwise you have to go down the road of thinking that [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5195.139999999999s)]
*  there are innate structures in our human mind that that give rise to to just ideas and concepts that [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5198.82s)]
*  are that are so exactly similar that you know again there there are people who who believe [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5206.98s)]
*  either way on those and and probably some uh we're gonna explore this really deeply it's [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5214.42s)]
*  gonna be the topic of an entire episode you know this mythological complex that goes up [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5219.22s)]
*  and west into europe the other one heads east through you know indonesia out into polynesia [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5224.82s)]
*  and through india china and over into the new world and eventually they go opposite ways around [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5231.7s)]
*  the world and they crash into each other and we're gonna trace those out not in the next [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5238.02s)]
*  episode but in the one after that we're gonna go real deep on this stuff so um if you like [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5242.34s)]
*  mythology you'll like that if you don't you might want to skip that one but i think you'll like it [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5247.9400000000005s)]
*  even if you don't think you'll like mythology because there's a lot of a lot of deep stuff that [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5251.9400000000005s)]
*  ties over into other uh historical topics you know there are there are these matching [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5256.5s)]
*  mythological motifs across continents and through the millennia and as we'll see in that episode [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5263.62s)]
*  the the spanish found so many direct corollaries to their christian practices and doctrines and [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5269.06s)]
*  aztec rituals and beliefs that they actually thought for certain that the devil was throwing [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5274.5s)]
*  up a mocking parody of their faith in the new world and so how do you explain something like [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5280.18s)]
*  that without appealing to his either historical migrations of peoples which means that there's [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5286.02s)]
*  there's some really deep way in which all of the peoples who have absorbed some kind of one of [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5292.58s)]
*  these connected mythologies are very similar you know if you accept the fact that we start with [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5300.66s)]
*  a basic operating system but then culture does most of the work of turning us into certain kinds [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5304.74s)]
*  of human beings there are certain ways in which these mythologies have created us that that lay [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5309.94s)]
*  the groundwork for a universal ability to communicate with one another and understand one [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5315.86s)]
*  another and yet as we see when the spanish confront the aztecs i mean these things can [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5320.58s)]
*  can really go by the time you get up to the top of that pyramid you can be talking about you know [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5326.74s)]
*  ideas that are very very different manifesting very different ways [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5332.98s)]
*  right i mean you know again it's it's you can talk about it as the historical migration of peoples [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5339.94s)]
*  or by insisting upon shared psychological and sociological structures that that lead men [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5345.38s)]
*  throughout the ages to respond to common challenges in certain ways but however these [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5350.26s)]
*  specific motifs and representations made their way across the earth or whether they popped up [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5354.900000000001s)]
*  independently you know they they have to be grafted on to individual humans and societies that [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5360.66s)]
*  weren't going to reject them or just relegate them to the level of folk tales and popular stories [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5366.5s)]
*  which all these cultures also had it's not like a story just shows up on their cultural border and [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5370.34s)]
*  they just work it into their religion because why not it's they had folk tales they had popular [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8WzqVr_KI&t=5375.54s)]
