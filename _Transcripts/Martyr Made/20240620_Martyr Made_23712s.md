Video Description: This episode discusses the beginning of Peoples' Temple's slide into radicalism after Jim Jones leads his people to California. We also talk about the development of 1960s radical political movements, and Jonestown conspiracy theories.

I had to record this episode in a hotel bathroom while on travel for work. The audio quality has some issues at various points. Hopefully, it's not too bad.

*  Here we go. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  I'm content to die for my beliefs. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  So cut off my head and make me a martyr. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  The people will always remember it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=73.6s)]
*  No, they will forget. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=76.6s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=82.6s)]
*  God is a thought. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=83.6s)]
*  God is an idea. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=84.6s)]
*  It is a place. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=85.6s)]
*  It is somewhere. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=86.6s)]
*  Hell does exist. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=87.6s)]
*  But its reference is to something that transcends all things. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=88.6s)]
*  I must come to my senses. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=89.6s)]
*  Why, we must tear ourselves apart for this small question of religion. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=90.6s)]
*  America is a wild country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=91.6s)]
*  This is the first thing to understand. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=118.96s)]
*  You don't know how wild a country you've got. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  The German born historian Paul Kennedy was once asked what to him as a European was the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  most striking and defining historical feature of the United States. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=131.88s)]
*  He said that it was the sheer size of the place. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=136.12s)]
*  He said that Americans, we often take for granted just how much space we have in this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  country and that's true. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=145.68s)]
*  When you go visit Europe or a lot of Southeast Asia, when you come back, when you're flying [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=148.04s)]
*  back in, it is really striking how you can not just drive but fly over large stretches [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=152.8s)]
*  of our country for long periods of time without encountering a significant human settlement. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=160.6s)]
*  It meant that there was always a frontier over which was literal wilderness with untamed [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=166.08s)]
*  land and people for the first few centuries after Europeans started settling this continent. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=175.22s)]
*  Paul Kennedy might be right about the open space and the frontier being our defining [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=184.42s)]
*  historical features but I'll suggest one more feature as being pretty fundamental to our [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=188.61999999999998s)]
*  makeup and our character, especially when it's combined with the presence of the frontier. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=194.14s)]
*  That's the fact that the majority of people who have arrived to America over the years, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=200.14s)]
*  they were people who weren't quite at home anywhere else. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  They were religious extremists being run out of their native lands for heresy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=211.66s)]
*  They were second sons looking to establish themselves and make their fortunes. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=216.6s)]
*  They were refugees from famine, war and oppression. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=222.14s)]
*  They were adventurers, they were outcasts, criminals, madmen and a lot of them were slaves. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=227.26s)]
*  To come back to Kennedy's answer, when those wanderers washed up on America's shores, they [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=236.98s)]
*  found themselves in a country that seemed to just stretch off to infinity. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=243.78s)]
*  People who weren't quite at home in their native land arrived in a place where if they [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=250.78s)]
*  still didn't quite feel comfortable, they could just pick up and move on again. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=255.2s)]
*  In America you could live far, far away from other people or you could just hop in your [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=261.92s)]
*  covered wagon and go leave a trail of pixelated buffalo corpses and children dead of cholera [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  along the Oregon Trail. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  A lot of Europeans will tell you if they've visited the American West just how shockingly [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=278.0s)]
*  big this country is, but at least today it's bounded. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=283.06s)]
*  You know that California's over there and New York's over there. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=287.58s)]
*  For much of the 19th century it wasn't even big. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=290.24s)]
*  It was endless. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=293.02s)]
*  A place you could get lost in. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=294.02s)]
*  And a place where, as the song lyric goes, people were allowed to have a past that they [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=297.66s)]
*  didn't care to mention. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=302.42s)]
*  For the first half or so of our history, if you didn't like where you found yourself, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=304.74s)]
*  you had one great big flashing option that did not involve finding some kind of accommodation [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=310.74s)]
*  with your neighbors. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=317.06s)]
*  That's a recipe for restless people. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=320.06s)]
*  When you put it together with the adventurous and sometimes desperate nature of those who [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=322.82s)]
*  made their way here, it's left us with a history that includes some pretty fascinating and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=329.66s)]
*  some pretty nutty characters and communities of which Jim Jones and People's Temple were [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=336.04s)]
*  just a recent catastrophic example. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  Many of the early religious settlers of the United States would often speak of Europe, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=348.0s)]
*  the place they were leaving as this doomed, decadent land out of which the pilgrims were [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=353.28s)]
*  going like the ancient Israelites from under the yoke of Pharaoh. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=358.32s)]
*  The bountiful but untamed North American continent was the promised land, the land of milk and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=364.32s)]
*  honey and it even came with some recalcitrant Canaanites who had to be wiped out to make [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  room for the newcomers just to make the whole biblical myth complete. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=374.52s)]
*  Ever since the beginning, America has had, we've experienced recurrences of that same [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=381.79999999999995s)]
*  mentality. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=389.4s)]
*  Occasional periods of mass enthusiasm that sees many people becoming repulsed by their [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  society, seeing it as decadent and corrupt and fearing its corrupting influence on them [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=395.79999999999995s)]
*  and looking forward and predicting its doom and then fleeing out to the countryside to [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=402.08s)]
*  go seek whatever it was that they felt was being lost. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=406.56s)]
*  We're the country whose two great cultural tomes might be Dale Carnegie's How to Win [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=412.28s)]
*  Friends and Influence People and Henry David Thoreau's Walden Pond. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=418.62s)]
*  The one sacred text for those people who were navigating the rat race, the other one for [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=424.78s)]
*  those who were looking to escape it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=429.26s)]
*  Although Jim Jones admittedly was no Thoreau, so maybe Walden's been displaced today by [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=432.78s)]
*  the Unabomber's Manifesto. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=438.58s)]
*  In the 19th century, in the early 19th century, America was going through one of these periods [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=441.38s)]
*  and the enthusiasm of the Second Great Awakening, as we call it today, it saw a bouquet of religious [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=447.42s)]
*  sects and movements flourish, many of which at the time were forced by the surrounding [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=453.54s)]
*  society to go seek refuge themselves in the wilderness, just as the pilgrims had been [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=458.54s)]
*  forced to seek refuge in the wilderness of America before them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=463.46s)]
*  Most of these little movements came and went, but a few of them turned out to have some [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=468.68s)]
*  staying power and stuck around, at least one of them you know about. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=472.94s)]
*  In 1820, a 15-year-old boy in New York State had a vision of two beings that he presumed [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=476.42s)]
*  to be God the Father and his son Jesus Christ. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=484.58s)]
*  He brought a message. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=487.58s)]
*  The message they delivered was the most common message that prophets of all ages and civilizations [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=490.02s)]
*  seem to receive. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=495.74s)]
*  The surrounding society has become corrupt and the existing religious authorities cannot [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=497.58s)]
*  help because they have turned away from the true faith. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=502.38s)]
*  So when that boy became a man three years later, he was visited by an angel and that [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=507.21999999999997s)]
*  angel directed him to the discovery of several items, among which were a breastplate and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=511.65999999999997s)]
*  some artifacts that were going to aid him in the translation of a gold-plated book buried [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=517.98s)]
*  in a hill near his home. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=523.66s)]
*  He was commanded by that angel not to show the plates to anyone, but he did manage to [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=527.18s)]
*  translate their content from an original script that he said was called Reformed Egyptian. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=531.22s)]
*  And according to the translation, it turned out that the Native Americans, not far over [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=536.6600000000001s)]
*  yonder frontier, had not trekked across the Bering Ice Bridge to colonize the Americas, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=544.14s)]
*  but they were in fact the biblical Israelites, who after being freed from Babylonian captivity [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=550.26s)]
*  had made their way to North America by boat. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=556.0600000000001s)]
*  In the Gospels, Jesus said that he'd come to gather up the lost sheep of the house of [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  Israel and so accordingly he made visits to his North American people after his resurrection, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=564.92s)]
*  but unfortunately over time they fell into irreligiousness and forgot their origins, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=570.12s)]
*  and by the time Columbus started poking around the Caribbean they had forgotten everything. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=575.56s)]
*  They degenerated into what we know today as Native Americans, mere savages with no recollection [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=580.4s)]
*  of their glorious spiritual past. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  That sounds a little bit odd to a lot of people, but a lot of religion sounds pretty odd to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=590.1999999999999s)]
*  most people these days. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=595.64s)]
*  So against all odds, the young man began to collect and baptize followers, which finally [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=597.36s)]
*  pushed the surrounding religious folks to take action against him, and so he led his [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=604.0999999999999s)]
*  people west where their penchant for unconventional sexual practices and conflict with the locals [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=608.0s)]
*  saw them chased from state to state to state until they finally settled themselves next [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=614.78s)]
*  to a great big salt lake in a part of the country that would become Utah, and you can [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=619.84s)]
*  still find the Mormons there today and they're doing quite well. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=624.88s)]
*  Right around the same time that Joseph Smith was leading his followers on their odyssey, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=628.64s)]
*  there was a Vermonter named John Humphrey Noyes and he was having an awakening of his own. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=637.84s)]
*  While he was studying at Yale and working as an anti-slavery activist, Noyes poured [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=642.8000000000001s)]
*  over the Bible trying to decipher the specific date of the second coming of Christ. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=648.68s)]
*  It's a favorite pastime of a lot of Christians, one that I have never quite been able to understand. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=653.56s)]
*  So he's doing this and he makes a surprising discovery. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=661.16s)]
*  Rather than looking forward, he discovered that the second coming had actually already [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=665.28s)]
*  occurred in 70 AD, the year that the Romans put down a rebellion of the Jews and destroyed [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=669.7199999999999s)]
*  the temple in Jerusalem. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=675.0s)]
*  What this meant is that mankind was not living today in the fallen age, waiting for the future [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=678.24s)]
*  redemption of the second coming, but we were in fact living in that redeemed post-apocalyptic [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=685.24s)]
*  age now, meaning that the consequences of the fall of man had already been abrogated [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=689.64s)]
*  and the state of sinless perfection was possible here now, in fact was expected of us. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=695.36s)]
*  Now how much has day-to-day behavior changed? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=702.4s)]
*  I don't know, but from that point on, Noyes declared that he had made himself transparent [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=706.4s)]
*  to the will of God and therefore anything he did was free of sin by definition, which [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=711.04s)]
*  is a pretty cool revelation to get about yourself. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=718.6s)]
*  He managed to cobble together a few followers, go through American history and it seems like [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=722.4399999999999s)]
*  no matter what you're putting out, you can find a couple people who will come along and [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=728.24s)]
*  these people established themselves in a large communal home in Oneida, New York, where they [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=732.48s)]
*  also began to institute some bizarre rules on the subject of sexuality that always seems [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=739.12s)]
*  to be a recurring pattern with these folks. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=745.2800000000001s)]
*  Seeing ordinary sex as a momentary affair, terminating in exhaustion and disgust and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=750.2800000000001s)]
*  deploring the waste of the male seed in any sex act that was not specifically intended [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=755.6400000000001s)]
*  for procreation, Noyes banned masturbation in the community and began to preach the [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=760.12s)]
*  benefits of male continence. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=764.68s)]
*  Between puberty and marriage, teenage boys were told to practice having sex with post-menopausal [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=768.28s)]
*  women in the community in order to sharpen their ability to withhold ejaculation without [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=774.1s)]
*  risk of pregnancy. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=778.6s)]
*  This need to apply extreme controls over the sexual impulse became pervasive in the community. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=781.62s)]
*  Noyes claimed that only he and a few of his close advisors had the spiritual maturity [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=788.4s)]
*  and self-control to practice unregulated sex without risk of unintended ejaculation, so [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=797.04s)]
*  naturally he reserved most of the virgin females of the community for himself. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=801.92s)]
*  Among everybody else, a form of free love was encouraged, but it was a highly regulated [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=807.88s)]
*  form of free love so long as there was no coming. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=814.4s)]
*  All of the liaisons had to be approved by a committee within the community that had [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=820.4s)]
*  been appointed for that specific task of matching couples according to their spiritual and moral [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=825.5600000000001s)]
*  qualities. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=830.5600000000001s)]
*  It was kind of a strange paraeugenics program that was supposed to be designed to breed [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=832.0s)]
*  more perfect children. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=837.96s)]
*  No meetings were held in the Oneida community on a regular basis in which members were subjected [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=843.04s)]
*  to withering accusations and criticism very similar to the struggle sessions that would [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=847.76s)]
*  later be adopted by communist groups in the 20th century. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=852.8s)]
*  Members were encouraged to call out other people for rule infractions or for signs of [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=857.5999999999999s)]
*  disloyalty or doubt or for lack of commitment to the common project. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=862.9599999999999s)]
*  Any attempt at self-defense was not allowed. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=867.04s)]
*  It was seen as a sign of excessive ego, of considering your own perspective as being [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=869.6s)]
*  superior to the perspective of the whole community that was accusing you, and so that was not [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=874.76s)]
*  permitted. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=878.96s)]
*  Noyes would position himself most of the time as the moderate, as the merciful one, protecting [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=882.0s)]
*  the accused from the wrath of the collective, the good cop. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=887.6s)]
*  It turned out that the rest of the community did not require much encouragement to go prove [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  their bona fides by going after each other hard. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=896.12s)]
*  Well, of course, very soon reports of sexual chaos and physical abuse began to leak outside [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=899.0s)]
*  of the community and some of the members' relatives began a campaign against the Oneida [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=906.88s)]
*  people. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=911.72s)]
*  Pressure began to mount and when in 1879 Noyes received word that he was about to be arrested [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=914.08s)]
*  for statutory rape, he fled the community and the country in the middle of the night [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=918.76s)]
*  and never came back. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=923.62s)]
*  So without Noyes' leadership, the Oneida community decided to reorganize itself into a joint [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=926.74s)]
*  stock company. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=932.1s)]
*  They eventually abandoned all of the less profitable money-making ventures that they [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=933.82s)]
*  had been engaged in before, but to this day they still make silverware and you can actually [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=937.98s)]
*  go buy it and from what I understand it's pretty decent stuff. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=943.4200000000001s)]
*  There are a lot of these examples in American history, a whole bunch of them, filling up [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=948.38s)]
*  whole books with varying degrees of unconventionality and hostility to the surrounding society. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=952.98s)]
*  Some of them were less religious like the utopian experiment sponsored by the wealthy [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=959.86s)]
*  19th century socialist, the Welsh socialist Robert Owen. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=963.9s)]
*  Some of them had religious roots but non-Christian religious roots like the Rasneesies who set [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=968.94s)]
*  themselves up in Oregon for a while before launching the worst bioterrorism attack in [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=973.66s)]
*  US history against a nearby small town. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=979.6600000000001s)]
*  And there are other flavors of it. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=984.22s)]
*  They come in all shapes and sizes. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=986.58s)]
*  Like I said, we're a country that you can fill up whole books with this stuff. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=988.5400000000001s)]
*  Black Americans didn't require some religious awakening to get the idea that the United [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=992.62s)]
*  States was an unfriendly and inhospitable place for them. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=997.58s)]
*  Our national bedtime story until very, very recently has tended to populate the antebellum [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1002.7800000000001s)]
*  North with these righteous abolitionist preachers and other people who were just so appalled [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1009.3s)]
*  by the conditions of blacks in the slave-holding South. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1014.9799999999999s)]
*  You know, there's something to that characterization, I suppose, but it would be a mistake to think [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1018.26s)]
*  that the North was in any way a friendly place for people with dark skin. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1023.3399999999999s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing in the human condition to compare with slavery, the [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1030.62s)]
*  horror of slavery. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1034.98s)]
*  But blacks, even in the tiny numbers in which they existed in the North at the time, they [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1037.22s)]
*  were considered an unwanted blight virtually everywhere north of the Mason-Dixon line before [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1042.0600000000002s)]
*  the Civil War. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1047.7s)]
*  There are reasons it took a couple generations and major labor shortages caused by the World [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1050.5400000000002s)]
*  Wars for blacks to finally pick up and leave the South for northern cities. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1055.98s)]
*  The North, for various reasons, was uncomfortable with slavery, sure, but then the cosmopolitan [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1062.54s)]
*  northern economy didn't depend on slavery. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1068.58s)]
*  That discomfort didn't mean that they wanted black people moving to their states or neighborhoods. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1073.26s)]
*  Of course, we all know about the Dred Scott case. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1079.42s)]
*  It was in 1857, just four years before the northern armies invaded the Confederate states, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1081.7s)]
*  and the Supreme Court held that no one of African descent could legally claim American [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1088.38s)]
*  citizenship. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1092.5400000000002s)]
*  Many blacks, going back to the days of slavery, found comfort in Christianity. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1096.5400000000002s)]
*  It's something that Jim Jones would complain about a lot, and others like Malcolm X and [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1102.8200000000002s)]
*  the black Muslims, they would become downright hostile toward that idea. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1107.22s)]
*  I can understand that. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1111.3400000000001s)]
*  I can understand a bit of bile rising in the back of the throat of someone like Malcolm, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1113.82s)]
*  seeing his people sing the songs of the master's religion, especially in the common form that [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1120.4199999999998s)]
*  it took, instructing oppressed peoples to endure their worldly suffering, their worldly [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1125.02s)]
*  situation and wait things out for a heavenly reward. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1131.6599999999999s)]
*  Now, obviously, it's more complicated. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1135.3s)]
*  Abolition preachers did provide the energy and leadership of the abolitionist movement, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1138.64s)]
*  and it genuinely was useful for people who were suffering under those conditions. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1143.74s)]
*  The myths of the Old Testament, for example, the trials of the Israelites being led off [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1150.24s)]
*  into captivity again and again, pining for deliverance and keeping the faith that they [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1154.96s)]
*  had not been forgotten, it provides a powerful framework for slaves and for former slaves [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1160.0400000000002s)]
*  who don't have a whole lot else to hold on to. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1165.92s)]
*  But I do understand where Malcolm was coming from. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1169.04s)]
*  Throughout American history, I was about to say most of American history, but I'll just [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1172.96s)]
*  go ahead and leave out the word most. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1176.6000000000001s)]
*  Throughout American history, it's been hard to imagine what real deliverance for black [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1178.4s)]
*  people might actually mean. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1183.72s)]
*  In the 1820s, around that same time that Joseph Smith and John Humphrey Noyes were looking [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1188.16s)]
*  for greener pastures for their outcast flocks, some others were looking around for a place [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1194.36s)]
*  to put America's free blacks. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1200.32s)]
*  They weren't wanted in the north. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1203.52s)]
*  They weren't wanted out west. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1205.84s)]
*  So some people had the idea that maybe they ought to go back to Africa. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1208.28s)]
*  Only this wasn't a racist meme. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1212.04s)]
*  They really meant it. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1214.24s)]
*  Some in the 18th century called it black Zionism, but that is a terrible misnomer. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1217.36s)]
*  The whole idea was really ridiculous because African Americans no longer had any connection [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1222.44s)]
*  to the continent that their ancestors had come from. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1228.04s)]
*  They'd been stripped of their names, stripped of their languages, their myths, their customs, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1233.1200000000001s)]
*  even any memory of which specific parts of Africa they'd been taken from. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1239.48s)]
*  I don't know if you know this, but Africa's a big ass place with lots of different kinds [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1245.0800000000002s)]
*  of people. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1249.0800000000002s)]
*  Some people gave it a shot, though, and the results were universally catastrophic. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1251.88s)]
*  I mean, just a disaster. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1257.88s)]
*  The country Liberia was founded by former American slaves, Liberia Liberty, that's what [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1260.68s)]
*  it comes from, and its capital, Monrovia, was named after James Monroe, who was the [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1265.7600000000002s)]
*  U.S. president at the time. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1270.7600000000002s)]
*  The English-speaking, Christian, Ameri-co-Liberian black colonists who settled that country from [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1273.0s)]
*  America, they had nothing but color in common with the dozens of indigenous groups along [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1279.6s)]
*  the coast and in the bush, which is to say that they had nothing at all in common. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1285.12s)]
*  And what happened is they just ended up replicating the brutal colonial practices of their former [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1290.0s)]
*  European masters on the local Africans themselves. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1294.28s)]
*  They intermarried mostly with other colonials, they formed eventually a separate ethnolinguistic [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1299.52s)]
*  group from the entire rest of the country, and the history of Liberia has been basically [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1305.44s)]
*  one long nightmare after another. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1310.52s)]
*  Its neighbor, Sierra Leone, is another country that was founded by free slaves, and it's [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1314.96s)]
*  a comparable disaster. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1318.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, its whole history has just been horrible. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1320.0s)]
*  The back-to-Africa movement of the 19th century fizzled out because American blacks did not [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1331.08s)]
*  have an Africa to go back to. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1335.6s)]
*  They had been robbed of that heritage long, long before, and they'd been whipped and beaten [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1338.08s)]
*  until it had just been completely pushed out of them. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1348.1999999999998s)]
*  And you like it or not, they were shipwrecked in North America, among people as unfamiliar [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1354.6s)]
*  and hostile as the natives that they would find in Africa. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1362.04s)]
*  There were other attempts over the years to reestablish some kind of connection, some [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1367.8s)]
*  kind of connection with the mother continent, from Marcus Garvey in the early 20th century [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1372.6399999999999s)]
*  to the enthusiasm for post-colonial African states among the dashiki-wearing black intellectuals [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1377.08s)]
*  and street soldiers in Harlem and other places in the 60s. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1383.16s)]
*  And maybe it sounds a little bit corny, but all the way up to, you see the way people [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1388.88s)]
*  responded to the Marvel Black Panther movie today. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1393.16s)]
*  Some of the attempts, I think, were very noble and beautiful. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1398.56s)]
*  There was something really special going on in New York in the 60s, for example, in Harlem. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1403.12s)]
*  And some of them, again, were corny corporate knockoffs. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1410.1599999999999s)]
*  Sorry to piss off all you Wakanda fans, but I don't know how you guys take seriously a [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1412.76s)]
*  movie whose plot centers around a white CIA agent going into a traditional African country, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1417.96s)]
*  taking sides in its civil war, and when his chosen side wins, getting them to give away [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1425.0s)]
*  all their precious natural resources to the rest of the world. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1429.04s)]
*  But whatever, you do you. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1431.8799999999999s)]
*  Spoiler alert, if you haven't seen Black Panther, the bad guys win. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1434.1599999999999s)]
*  Anyway, what do you do? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1438.3600000000001s)]
*  What do you do when you have no home and there's nowhere to go? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1441.48s)]
*  Martin Luther King had an idea, and it was a good one. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1448.44s)]
*  Beautiful, beautiful idea. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1452.0s)]
*  The problem was that it involved waiting, or not waiting, he took action to make it [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1455.1200000000001s)]
*  But still, for his dream to become a reality required his oppressors to experience a change [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1462.68s)]
*  of heart comparable to something like a mass religious awakening. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1469.04s)]
*  And he still might have pulled that off if the devil hadn't had his say, but the devil [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1474.2s)]
*  had his say, obviously. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1479.76s)]
*  Martin Luther King's ideas came from Jesus, and he modeled his tactics on those of Gandhi, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1482.8400000000001s)]
*  But in some ways Gandhi had an easier job than he did. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1487.84s)]
*  Because Gandhi only needed the British to leave India. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1493.08s)]
*  He didn't need the British to get comfortable living next door to Indians, to accept them [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1496.76s)]
*  as equals, as fellow citizens, as brothers and sisters. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1501.6s)]
*  Jim Jones would come up with another idea, and he would try to put it into action. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1507.84s)]
*  Actually, it was one that he had borrowed from another Black religious leader who was [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1512.72s)]
*  already an old man by the time Martin Luther King came on the scene. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1517.56s)]
*  Very fascinating guy. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1520.24s)]
*  A very uniquely American figure who was known by his people as Father Divine, or Reverend [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1521.96s)]
*  Major Jealous Divine. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1530.08s)]
*  That was his full self coined name. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1531.28s)]
*  So Father Divine was a Black sharecropper's son born somewhere between 1860 and 1880 in [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1535.04s)]
*  either Georgia or Maryland. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1541.8s)]
*  He just didn't go straight into a computer back then. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1545.52s)]
*  So he grows to young adulthood, he's supporting himself doing odd jobs for a while before [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1547.24s)]
*  he eventually turns preacher, and he was an eccentric guy. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1553.52s)]
*  I'm sure you can see at least that this is going in that direction. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1557.36s)]
*  In his twenties he ends up linking up with a couple of other traveling preachers. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1562.04s)]
*  One of them was going around telling people that he himself was God incarnate. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1566.36s)]
*  The association of the three hit the rocks when the third man, the third preacher, announced [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1572.52s)]
*  that he'd been studying the Bible, and it had been revealed to him that in fact all [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1576.24s)]
*  men were God incarnate, if only they would realize it. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1580.1200000000001s)]
*  So Father Divine evaluated their positions and he sided with the first preacher. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1584.76s)]
*  He said, no, no, no, God cannot inhere in every man. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1588.2s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1591.2s)]
*  But then he said, you're wrong too, because as it turns out, it's me and not you who is [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1592.5s)]
*  God in the flesh. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1596.96s)]
*  So they break up. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1599.88s)]
*  Father Divine's traveling around the local area and he's inviting controversy with other [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1602.2s)]
*  preachers for proclaiming his divinity, inviting something more than controversy though for [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1606.32s)]
*  preaching a gospel of black liberation and racial solidarity. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1611.48s)]
*  This is in the south during the ascendancy of the second KKK. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1615.72s)]
*  He made enough enemies in short order that he ended up doing 60 days on a chain gang [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1619.56s)]
*  in 1913, and soon after he adds a wrinkle to his message by rejecting gender distinctions [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1624.44s)]
*  as well as racial differences, and very quickly begins attracting a devoted following of mostly [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1631.16s)]
*  black women. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1636.64s)]
*  The next year, 1914, many of those women's husbands and several local preachers got together [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1639.2s)]
*  and brought accusations against him, and so he was arrested again and booked in Georgia [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1645.46s)]
*  under the name John Doe, alias God. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1650.04s)]
*  The court found him to be mentally unsound and ordered him deported from Georgia. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1655.36s)]
*  It's a very strange thing, and I think that those of us who aren't prone to interest in [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1661.52s)]
*  this kind of thing ourselves find it very difficult to comprehend. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1665.6399999999999s)]
*  I do. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1669.8s)]
*  Through all my study of related topics as I've been preparing these podcasts, I still don't [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1671.12s)]
*  have much to say about it, and I won't attempt to explain it here, but while he was in prison [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1676.4399999999998s)]
*  in Georgia, many, many, many more people began coming to the prison to hear him speak [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1680.88s)]
*  and to hear him preach from his cell. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1686.6000000000001s)]
*  White people began calling on him, including a local university professor who got a lawyer [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1688.72s)]
*  to represent him for free. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1692.96s)]
*  So the next year he turns up in New York with about a dozen followers. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1696.3400000000001s)]
*  They get a house in Harlem and set up a commune, and again, they establish strict rules forbidding [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1701.1200000000001s)]
*  Also, no smoking, alcohol, or gambling are allowed. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1706.32s)]
*  He begins to gain more and more followers because his people are very motivated and [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1711.96s)]
*  devoted and they're out there spreading the word and pulling people in. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1716.56s)]
*  He marries a woman named Panina. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1719.48s)]
*  I haven't really been able to find anything at all about her. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1720.96s)]
*  Nothing much seems to be known, and he told his people that although they were married, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1725.12s)]
*  in accordance with their rules, their marriage would never be consummated. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1729.28s)]
*  Then he moves his people into a majority white neighborhood in Long Island after a German [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1734.24s)]
*  American who lived there was feuding with his also German American neighbor, and he [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1740.68s)]
*  got so mad at him he decided to move out of his house and sell it to Father Divine just [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1745.8s)]
*  to piss off his neighbor. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1750.08s)]
*  So they move in and he continues to bring in followers. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1751.84s)]
*  People are making large donations. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1755.04s)]
*  He does the whole 20th century televangelist thing. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1757.68s)]
*  He's wearing fine clothes, he's driving a Cadillac. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1761.96s)]
*  Of course, that pissed off his white neighbors to no end. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1764.68s)]
*  In 1931, he's arrested for disturbing the peace and immediately posts a thousand dollars [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1768.24s)]
*  bail in cash, which was pretty shocking in the early years of the Depression. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1773.04s)]
*  He would hold these large free banquets for followers and anybody else who wanted to come [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1780.44s)]
*  along and by the early 30s, he was feeding thousands of people. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1784.96s)]
*  One night at a particularly loud and raucous feast that he was giving, his angry neighbors [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1789.6399999999999s)]
*  surrounded his property and it actually looked like some violence might occur. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1794.0s)]
*  So somebody called the police and the cops showed up with buses to take away Father Divine [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1798.0s)]
*  and all his followers to jail. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1804.1599999999999s)]
*  They were annoyed when the people insisted on being booked under their weird sounding [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1807.32s)]
*  religious names rather than their actual legal names. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1811.24s)]
*  Many some lot of his people were arrested along with him and at that point at least [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1816.12s)]
*  a dozen or so of them were white. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1819.9599999999998s)]
*  They were all charged $5 bail, $350 or so in total. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1822.8s)]
*  So Father Divine just whips out a $500 bill and slaps it on the counter to pay for all [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1826.8799999999999s)]
*  of them and the court embarrassingly didn't even have enough money on hand to make change [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1831.0s)]

*  The next year he's arrested again and a few days after he's put in jail, the judge who [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1838.4799999999998s)]
*  gave the order dies of a heart attack and his people are keeping vigil outside his cell [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1843.4s)]
*  and Father Divine lamented that he'd hated to have to cause the man's death but he'd [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1849.2800000000002s)]
*  been given no choice. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1854.2800000000002s)]
*  I won't go into the whole story, there's a lot more to it. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1855.2800000000002s)]
*  The point is by the time Jim Jones reads about Father Divine in the late 1950s, this eccentric [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1859.0s)]
*  sharecropper's son has created an empire. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1867.88s)]
*  His wife Paninas passed away and he married a 21 year old white woman named Edna Richings [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1872.2s)]
*  in 1946 and he justified the marriage by saying that the spirit of his dead wife had transmigrated [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1876.72s)]
*  into the body of the younger woman. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1883.0s)]
*  His movement, he called it the International Peace Mission, had tens of thousands of members [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1885.72s)]
*  by now, owned countless businesses around the country bringing in millions and millions [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1891.32s)]
*  of dollars. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1897.72s)]
*  All the businesses were staffed by his followers and his followers lived communally in buildings [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1900.08s)]
*  that were owned and run by the movement and so their needs were met by the movement but [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1905.52s)]
*  they weren't paid anything. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1910.6799999999998s)]
*  He'd established himself in this massive French Gothic mansion on a 72 acre estate outside [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1913.84s)]
*  Philadelphia which was given to him by one of his followers. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1919.1399999999999s)]
*  You gotta see this place. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1923.0s)]
*  Press releases announced that he'd exercised his authority to name Philadelphia the capital [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1926.12s)]
*  of planet Earth and another press release said that it was actually he who had invented [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1930.9199999999998s)]
*  the hydrogen bomb and shared the information with the American government. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1936.52s)]
*  Among the businesses that were owned by the Peace Mission were a lot of hotels. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1941.9599999999998s)]
*  Guests would rent rooms in them like any hotel but they also served as living quarters for [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1946.4799999999998s)]
*  establishing bases of operations in cities across the country and providing a place for [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1952.12s)]
*  his people to live communally according to an alternative racially integrated lifestyle [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1956.9599999999998s)]
*  centered around the quasi-worship of Father Divine. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1962.56s)]
*  I'm telling you, this was a big operation. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1966.4399999999998s)]
*  I need to emphasize that. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1968.8799999999999s)]
*  Go look up Woodmont Estate. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1970.52s)]
*  That's the mansion he lived in. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1972.1599999999999s)]
*  You can still see pictures of it. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1973.1599999999999s)]
*  The place is no joke. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  In 1959, Jim Jones had his own church for just a few years and he was doing a few things [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1978.68s)]
*  in miniature, very, very miniature, that he had read about when he discovered Father Divine. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1986.48s)]
*  So he had to see this for himself. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1994.96s)]
*  This was a guy who was doing the things that he was trying to be doing at scale and so [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=1995.96s)]
*  in typical Jim Jones direct fashion he hops in a car with a few of his people and heads [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2001.0600000000002s)]
*  out for Philadelphia and he couldn't believe what he saw when he got there. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2005.48s)]
*  Father Divine met him and the meeting went very well. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2011.28s)]
*  Divine was pleased to meet a young white preacher from the Midwest with an integrated congregation [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2015.08s)]
*  of his own who was interested in a lot of the same things he was. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2021.6s)]
*  He was impressed by Jim's energy and his passion and they spoke for a long time about the battle [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2025.16s)]
*  against segregation in the South. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2032.08s)]
*  Again, this is 1959, before most people are talking about it. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2034.68s)]
*  They talked about shared concerns like nuclear war and overpopulation. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2038.6s)]
*  Jim made a good impression. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2042.92s)]
*  He knew how to handle him. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2043.92s)]
*  He addressed Father Divine as an elder superior mentor, deferring to him and flattering him, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2046.2s)]
*  but manages to still present himself as a serious enough person in his own right that [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2051.72s)]
*  Divine invited him to deliver a sermon to his people at Woodmont, which he did. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2056.12s)]
*  That went well also. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2060.64s)]
*  So with that done, on the car ride home, Jim is exuberant. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2063.84s)]
*  His mind is racing with possibilities after seeing what this uneducated black man who [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2068.1600000000003s)]
*  had started from nothing had built for himself. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2074.08s)]
*  At the time, things were going very well for Jim Jones. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2077.36s)]
*  He's brimming with his own confidence. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2081.1200000000003s)]
*  In just a few years, he'd built his own church from scratch, literally just a few folding [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2083.08s)]
*  chairs and a rented storefront into a church of several hundred dedicated members. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2088.68s)]
*  And he realized that if Father Divine could do what he'd done, with all the disadvantages [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2095.4s)]
*  of being black and poor and uneducated and lacking any initial resources or connections [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2100.2s)]
*  to draw upon, then for somebody like Jim, the sky would be the limit. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2106.52s)]
*  He marveled at the way Divine's followers just seemed to worship him. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2112.52s)]
*  Jim had already had a taste of that kind of adulation, but only a little taste, and he [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2117.44s)]
*  wanted more. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2122.56s)]
*  He saw how he could transform the personal loyalty that his followers had toward him [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2125.04s)]
*  into positive social action, but Divine had managed to do it at scale. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2131.2s)]
*  There were two other aspects that really got his attention, too. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2138.64s)]
*  The first had to do with Jim's politics. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2141.2s)]
*  I'm talking about his socialist politics and his concern for racial justice. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2144.72s)]
*  This was America in the Eisenhower years. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2150.0s)]
*  Nobody's talking about revolution or thinking about it. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2152.24s)]
*  In 1959, when he met Father Divine, we'd seen the Montgomery bus boycotts after the Rosa [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2156.2s)]
*  Parks incident, but we're still a year or two out from when the Greensboro sit-ins and [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2162.08s)]
*  the Freedom Rides were going to bring the plight of African Americans so starkly and [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2166.3999999999996s)]
*  so dramatically into the mainstream middle class consciousness. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2170.2799999999997s)]
*  This was before all that. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2173.7999999999997s)]
*  But in Divine's outfit, Jim saw something that brought both of those obsessions of his [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2177.56s)]
*  together. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2182.2799999999997s)]
*  This was socialism in action. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2183.2799999999997s)]
*  No revolution required. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2185.48s)]
*  You didn't need to make the revolution. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2188.2s)]
*  You could be it. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2189.7599999999998s)]
*  A decade or so later, millions of young Americans are going to have that same realization and [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2191.3599999999997s)]
*  flock out to the countryside to live in experimental communal farms and setting up food co-ops [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2197.28s)]
*  and collective living spaces in Berkeley or San Francisco and other cities across the [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2204.28s)]
*  country. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2208.4s)]
*  That was a long way off, but Jim could see it now. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2209.88s)]
*  All this was flashing before his eyes. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2214.0400000000004s)]
*  Besides the political aspect, there was something else that transformed the way that Jim Jones [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2218.0s)]
*  would approach his work. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2222.1200000000003s)]
*  He knew from his time on the healing and revival circuit that people could be brought around [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2224.08s)]
*  to believing some things that, well, things that were at odds with what science and the [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2229.44s)]
*  rest of society would tell them was real. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2236.2s)]
*  He already knew that, but Divine showed him that you could say damn near anything. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2239.52s)]
*  And if you brought it off right, with a confident delivery and presentation and couched it in [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2245.52s)]
*  terms that engage people emotionally, you get an audience. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2250.32s)]
*  Father Divine was quite evidently a bit touched. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2256.6000000000004s)]
*  Jim could see that. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2259.0800000000004s)]
*  And yet Jim could also see the followers and their dedication and the mansion and the money [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2260.76s)]
*  and the work that they were doing. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2266.0400000000004s)]
*  His people were living socialism right in the guts of the capitalist beast. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2269.6800000000003s)]
*  By the late 50s, Father Divine was, he wasn't being arrested anymore. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2274.2000000000003s)]
*  He was no longer looked upon by outsiders as a criminal or a nuisance as he was in his [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2279.48s)]
*  early years. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2283.2000000000003s)]
*  He's kind of looked on as more of a joke. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2284.2000000000003s)]
*  But I mean, I'm talking about the wider white mainstream society, by the way, and the black [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2285.48s)]
*  community in places like Harlem, even among black intellectuals, their relationship to [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2290.96s)]
*  him was more complicated, as you can imagine. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2295.44s)]
*  He was obviously very eccentric. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2298.2400000000002s)]
*  But how could you just dismiss a guy who really had done a lot of serious work in the realm [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2300.44s)]
*  of racial integration and had actually provided a pretty good life for thousands of poor black [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2307.2799999999997s)]
*  people? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2311.68s)]
*  You know, there are a lot of figures like that in black American history. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2312.68s)]
*  Take someone like Lewis Farrakhan, for example. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2317.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a little different, obviously, but every so often one of Lewis Farrakhan's speeches [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2321.2799999999997s)]
*  will blow up in the media after he goes on one of his crazy anti-Semitic rants. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2325.6s)]
*  And what happens next is always the same. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2330.64s)]
*  It's practically a ritual by this point. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2333.4399999999996s)]
*  The Anti-Defamation League and other Jewish organizations go around to prominent black [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2336.0s)]
*  leaders demanding that they denounce Minister Farrakhan and the black leaders kind of hedge [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2339.56s)]
*  or do something other than just give him the full David Duke treatment. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2345.48s)]
*  And the Jewish organizations are outraged at the black leaders' refusal to just denounce [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2350.64s)]
*  this guy. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2354.52s)]
*  And in the papers, they invite the rest of society to join in their outrage. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2356.0s)]
*  And the same old tired debate happens. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2359.68s)]
*  talk radio chimes in the next day. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2362.36s)]
*  Well, isn't that just racism? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2364.6s)]
*  Why do we tolerate it just because he's black? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2366.76s)]
*  Isn't that a double standard? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2368.88s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2369.88s)]
*  And it all makes perfectly logical sense. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2371.56s)]
*  And if you're just showing up out of nowhere to the debate, you know, you can't understand [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2374.1400000000003s)]
*  why the black leaders have so much trouble just kicking Farrakhan off the island. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2378.5s)]
*  And you know, it's something that I've only come to understand a little bit over the years. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2384.04s)]
*  I mean, look, I'm not, there's no condoning anything that Farrakhan says about Jews or [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2388.72s)]
*  white people or any of that. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2393.72s)]
*  And the black leaders never do condone it. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2396.2799999999997s)]
*  And they're obviously uncomfortable with it and embarrassed by it. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2398.24s)]
*  And by the fact that they're compelled to answer for it. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2402.2799999999997s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you know, in some way, Farrakhan is family, and you don't abandon [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2406.2799999999997s)]
*  just because they say some crazy or reprehensible shit from time to time. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2413.0s)]
*  When you've been a people under siege, and if that sounds like an exaggeration, then [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2418.6s)]
*  these last few episodes have failed to do their work. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2423.44s)]
*  You know, you don't toss out somebody who shows up when the chips are down. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2429.56s)]
*  I've tried to talk to people about this, and it's really hard to get through if you don't [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2434.36s)]
*  already agree with what I'm saying. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2437.56s)]
*  And I totally understand that. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2439.36s)]
*  Because yes, he is racist, he is anti-Semitic. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2441.2000000000003s)]
*  And yes, racism and anti-Semitic are bad. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2444.6s)]
*  And in our society, the rule is supposed to be that if we decide you're racist or anti-Semitic, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2448.92s)]
*  then that's it. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2453.6800000000003s)]
*  You're done. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2454.6800000000003s)]
*  No one else is even allowed to talk to you anymore. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2455.6800000000003s)]
*  But when you've been through what black people have been through, fought the battles that [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2459.32s)]
*  they have had to fight, it is very, very difficult. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2464.52s)]
*  It feels like a betrayal to just completely exile someone who showed up and put himself [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2468.44s)]
*  on the line with you in those battles. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2473.94s)]
*  I'm not even defending the fact that they don't shut him out. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2477.56s)]
*  They probably should. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2480.56s)]
*  I'm just saying that it's hard. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2481.56s)]
*  You know, a lot of people kind of take the attitude like, ugh, there he goes again. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2485.04s)]
*  Don't mind him, that's just crazy Uncle Louis. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2490.6s)]
*  I promise he's not really this bad. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2493.44s)]
*  Look, he's been there when it mattered. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2497.44s)]
*  Just don't bring up the Jews around him. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2500.2400000000002s)]
*  And I'm not defending that. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2503.62s)]
*  I'm just saying that I'm refusing to appoint myself their judge. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2506.08s)]
*  You've listened to the series on Zionism, and there are a lot of the really violent, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2511.48s)]
*  terroristic Zionists from those early years who are heroes to this day in Israel, guys [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2515.8s)]
*  who are real murderers of innocence. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2521.38s)]
*  But they love their people, and they showed up when it mattered, and so I don't judge [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2524.88s)]
*  Israelis who still hold them up either. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2530.96s)]
*  Anyway, enough of that sidetrack. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2534.28s)]
*  That's just great. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2538.12s)]
*  I go off script for two minutes and I end up defending Louis Farrakhan. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2539.12s)]
*  I don't expect anybody to agree with anything I just said. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2543.6400000000003s)]
*  It's a very touchy subject. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2546.56s)]
*  Obviously, Father Divine is a controversial guy in a very different way. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2548.6400000000003s)]
*  Not in any way that is threatening or racist or anything like that, but just that he was [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2554.56s)]
*  pretty obviously a bit off his rocker, a bit of a charlatan, a huckster, and yet the black [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2559.24s)]
*  leaders who you would expect to see through all that stuff, they do see through it. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2567.84s)]
*  They understand all that. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2570.28s)]
*  But back in the day, he had some cache amongst some of the people in the black community [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2571.28s)]
*  because, hey, our people are being exploited and abused, and what are you doing about it? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2575.44s)]
*  Father Divine is doing something. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2582.52s)]
*  So anyway, Jim Jones comes back from this trip and his head is spinning. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2586.52s)]
*  It's spinning in ways that are causing some alarm among a few of his assistant pastors [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2591.6s)]
*  and parishioners, many of whom at this point are still very conventional Pentecostal Christians. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2597.08s)]
*  Jim had already been presenting himself as someone special, as the guy who personally [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2604.68s)]
*  was the answer to all your problems. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2609.52s)]
*  But after visiting Father Divine, he comes back aping a lot of his rhetoric word for [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2611.56s)]
*  word. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2616.2s)]
*  Jim spent hours listening to Divine's recordings, and he began to work Divine's words into his [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2617.68s)]
*  own sermons. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2622.24s)]
*  His more traditional-minded friends and followers didn't know what to make of that, but Jim [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2624.64s)]
*  actually knew what he was doing. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2628.6s)]
*  He'd seen that Father Divine was an old man, no longer even capable of conducting his own [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2630.96s)]
*  services as followers listened to tape recordings of him. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2637.56s)]
*  Divine was rarely even seen in person anymore. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2641.04s)]
*  This is a movement that was completely built around the guy. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2645.92s)]
*  It was a cult of personality. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2650.2s)]
*  That personality was not going to be long for the world, and when he died, who would [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2653.32s)]
*  be there to inherit the mantle? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2658.32s)]
*  Jim Jones was going to make sure that he was ready when that day came. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2661.56s)]
*  Again, that might sound a little presumptuous, but remember, when you're talking about a [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2665.08s)]
*  movement like this, it's not a government or some corporation like Coca-Cola where there [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2669.4s)]
*  are laws that dictate organizational processes and rules of succession. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2676.1600000000003s)]
*  The whole thing is built on credibility. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2680.6s)]
*  If the people believe in you, then you're the guy. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2683.92s)]
*  Who's going to tell you you're not? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2688.1600000000003s)]
*  You would have to be someone else that the people believe in more than you. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2691.56s)]
*  Legitimacy is all there is. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2694.92s)]
*  Jim Jones was ambitious, and he knew how persuasive he could be, and how many talented, charismatic [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2697.12s)]
*  preachers were out there at this point working like he was for racial integration and the [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2703.7200000000003s)]
*  other issues that mattered to the people in Father Divine's movement. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2709.8s)]
*  Who was going to challenge him? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2714.0s)]
*  He'd seen no one around Father Divine that he felt like he had to worry about. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2715.92s)]
*  His young wife, his young white wife, please. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2720.2400000000002s)]
*  So from that day, Jim Jones began to prepare for when he would have the inevitable opportunity [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2724.24s)]
*  to make a play for Father Divine's empire. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2729.24s)]
*  But that day was going to have to wait. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2733.7999999999997s)]
*  Jim Jones, at this point, twist of fate maybe. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2737.48s)]
*  He was getting lost in the clouds in more ways than one. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2743.04s)]
*  It's hard to say what began to set him off in 1959, 1960. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2746.8399999999997s)]
*  It's kind of hard to say, but it's right in those two years somewhere. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2752.36s)]
*  He never really talked about it himself in later years, and we've kind of had to piece [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2756.04s)]
*  it together from the people who knew him and from public records. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2760.44s)]
*  Maybe he was just overwhelmed by his ambition. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2766.0s)]
*  After returning from seeing Father Divine, he remained in contact with him, and they [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2768.56s)]
*  developed a strong mentor-mentee relationship, apparently. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2772.52s)]
*  Jim's own church was growing and the activities, again, in miniature, but Jim was always a [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2777.44s)]
*  micromanager in a lot of ways, so it was a lot of work. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2783.64s)]
*  Modeled on, Divine's organization were taking off faster than he could have imagined. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2788.4s)]
*  By 1961, Jim Jones was feeding more people and providing more services to poor and working-class [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2794.1600000000003s)]
*  people in Indianapolis, maybe than any other private citizen or group in the city. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2800.6000000000004s)]
*  That's why the mayor of Indianapolis had put Jim in charge of the city's Human Rights Commission, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2807.44s)]
*  and he was using that position to do important integration work around the city. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2811.6400000000003s)]
*  Maybe Jim began to get lost in it. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2818.48s)]
*  Maybe it was more than he could handle on his own, and inside he felt inadequate to [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2820.98s)]
*  the task that he had set before himself and to the growing profile he had with his people. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2825.92s)]
*  Maybe it was recently seeing his adopted daughter, the little Korean war orphan Stephanie, killed [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2832.04s)]
*  in that terrible car accident, being on scene when it happened, and suffering through the [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2837.6s)]
*  indignity of seeing her body buried in the rain in a run-down cemetery in a waterlogged [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2842.7200000000003s)]
*  grave because most of the cemeteries in town wouldn't allow a Korean child to be buried [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2849.52s)]
*  next to white people. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2854.38s)]
*  Jim Jones really loved that girl, and his wife loved that girl. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2857.58s)]
*  And Jim was the type of man to experience volcanic rage over something like that and [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2861.3s)]
*  never ever to forgive it. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2869.1s)]
*  Maybe it was the pressure of the escalating confrontations that came with being an integrationist. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2873.38s)]
*  He attracted a lot of negative attention from local racists for his work with the Human [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2881.38s)]
*  Rights Commission. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2886.42s)]
*  He was threatening boycotts to pressure local businesses to integrate, and he was pissing [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2887.42s)]
*  off a lot of people. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2892.04s)]
*  He got letters from the local chapter of the American Nazi Party. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2893.84s)]
*  His wife, I mentioned this in a previous episode, his wife was spit on and called nigger lover [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2899.38s)]
*  while she walked down the street with their adopted black son. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2905.1800000000003s)]

*  I can tell you if that was me and it was my wife being spit on and my little boy being [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2917.1800000000003s)]
*  called nigger lover over, you better call out the fucking National Guard. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2924.88s)]
*  Jim Jones had a worse temper than I do. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2930.0800000000004s)]
*  Maybe it was the global political situation. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2934.86s)]
*  Jim Jones was a guy, he's one of those guys who took that very, very personally. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2938.02s)]
*  It shouldn't be that strange when you see how a lot of people behave over politics today. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2942.02s)]
*  It's kind of hard for us to imagine today what it was like for people back in the day [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2948.1s)]
*  when the hydrogen bomb was first invented. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2953.48s)]
*  When it first started getting strapped to intercontinental rockets. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2957.02s)]
*  In a relative blink of an eye, it suddenly became a completely plausible reality that [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2959.86s)]
*  human life on the planet could just poof, be done. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2967.74s)]
*  Just like that. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2970.66s)]
*  The push of a button. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2971.66s)]
*  Finished. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2972.66s)]
*  That was, I mean, it was real. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2973.66s)]
*  We've gone long enough now without it happening that we've kind of forgotten about that. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2975.7s)]
*  But at the beginning, we had just come out of World War II. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2979.2999999999997s)]
*  Sixty million people were killed. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2983.54s)]
*  It looked like, you know, it looked like countries around the world would do just about anything [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2984.7799999999997s)]
*  to each other. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2990.4599999999996s)]
*  And all of a sudden they've got hydrogen bombs strapped to intercontinental ballistic missiles. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2992.5s)]
*  I mean, biblical book of Revelation stuff. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2997.1800000000003s)]
*  Not in the hands of God, but in the hands of the same people who had just fought that [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=2999.94s)]
*  war. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3004.9s)]
*  The same people who were in charge of a society that had until recently been holding millions [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3005.9s)]
*  of slaves captive and was still keeping tens of millions of black people in subjugation. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3010.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't know what it does to the psychology of a child to do those drills in those classrooms [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3016.1800000000003s)]
*  where they have everyone hide under their desks or time themselves as they rush into [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3023.3199999999997s)]
*  the basement to prepare for a nuclear attack. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3027.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't know what that does to a psychology of a child. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3030.68s)]
*  I don't know what it does to have those drills stopped because once the hydrogen bomb was [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3032.9599999999996s)]
*  invented there's no longer any point pretending that it was survivable. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3036.7999999999997s)]
*  We look back into the ancient past, periods of plague or famine, or even when people see [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3043.08s)]
*  a comet or some other sign in the sky that they can't explain. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3049.32s)]
*  And then when we read in those history books that as a result some people began believing [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3053.52s)]
*  that the end of the world was at hand, we think, yeah, okay, that makes sense. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3057.1600000000003s)]
*  We're not surprised by it. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3060.84s)]
*  The same thing happened when all of a sudden you had John F. Kennedy on TV saying that [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3064.0s)]
*  the United States faced a missile gap and that we needed to build more and bigger nuclear [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3068.44s)]
*  weapons in addition to the thousands and thousands we already had because if the Soviets got [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3072.92s)]
*  too far ahead of us they would launch a first strike with the belief that they could disable [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3077.62s)]
*  our ability to retaliate. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3081.42s)]
*  It's often hard throughout his life to parse where Jim Jones is expressing his true feelings [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3084.9s)]
*  and where he's just running a game, but one thing that emerges very clearly is that his [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3090.86s)]
*  terror over nuclear weapons and nuclear war was real. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3094.98s)]
*  It was heartfelt and bone deep. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3099.14s)]
*  It couldn't have helped that Reverend Branham, Jim's model on the prophecy and healing circuit [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3102.54s)]
*  in 1961 prophesied that atomic Armageddon was just around the corner. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3106.9s)]
*  Jim's politics had him keeping up in detail with the budding third world revolutions and [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3113.34s)]
*  post-colonial states in Africa, South America, and Asia. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3118.26s)]
*  We know how excited he was when the Cubans launched their socialist revolt. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3120.98s)]
*  We know how traumatized he was in early 1960 when he visited Cuba and witnessed the terror [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3126.2200000000003s)]
*  bombing of Cuban peasants and that he came back swearing that it was American pilots [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3131.7000000000003s)]
*  flying those planes. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3136.26s)]
*  He said he'd seen them. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3137.26s)]
*  He said he had pictures of them. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3138.26s)]
*  Castro was beloved in Harlem and among black intellectuals at the time. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3143.9s)]
*  People Jones knew and admired, not knew personally, but he read them. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3147.86s)]
*  He admired these people and they loved Castro. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3151.26s)]
*  When the young, hopeful John F. Kennedy took office, Jim Jones reads about the failed attempt [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3155.1800000000003s)]
*  to take out the Cuban regime that he admired so much at the Bay of Pigs. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3159.5800000000004s)]
*  In 1960 and 1961, with the rest of America, he turns on his TV and he begins to see with [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3165.62s)]
*  his own eyes the rage-maddened saliva-flecked mouths of white southern mobs, not only sheriffs [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3170.22s)]
*  and police, but a lot of regular people cursing and screaming and committing violence against [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3177.7s)]
*  stoic black protesters who were being beaten and hosed and attacked by dogs and killed. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3184.02s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3193.3s)]
*  I don't know what it was that set Jim Jones off. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3194.78s)]
*  I don't think anybody does. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3196.98s)]
*  It may be though that he was just a mentally ill man and it was just around this time that [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3198.6200000000003s)]
*  his delusions and paranoia started to get the better of him with a little help from [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3204.98s)]
*  everything else. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3209.84s)]
*  What we do know is that he began behaving very erratically, suffering headaches and [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3211.7000000000003s)]
*  collapses, fearing that he was being watched and that there were people out there plotting [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3217.34s)]
*  against his life. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3222.28s)]
*  Other people couldn't see inside his head, so to justify his behavior and to get them [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3224.82s)]
*  to share in his paranoia, he would sometimes manufacture fake threats against himself to [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3228.6000000000004s)]
*  prove his case. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3232.92s)]
*  His wife, Marceline, and his close advisors, they knew something was going on. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3236.2400000000002s)]
*  Finally, by mid-1961, he's telling his friends that he's receiving communications from extraterrestrials, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3242.88s)]
*  Noah-like, of an impending nuclear collapse apocalypse, and that he was supposed to find [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3251.1200000000003s)]
*  a safe haven and take his people there. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3257.88s)]
*  It was all too much. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3260.88s)]
*  In October of 1961, Jim Jones suffered a nervous breakdown and he was admitted to the hospital [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3263.76s)]
*  with serious ulcers and thus began one of the strangest and most controversial periods [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3270.2000000000003s)]
*  of Jim Jones' life. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3276.88s)]
*  The Divine would have to wait. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3280.2s)]
*  Everything about this period of Jim's life is vague and poorly documented, this two years [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3283.6s)]
*  so period, from the reasons he decided to pack his bags and abandon his church, which [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3288.7599999999998s)]
*  at the time had grown to regularly see 1,500 to 2,000 people on a normal Sunday come in [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3294.08s)]
*  for the services, to where he went and why and what he did while he was gone. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3301.12s)]
*  The common story is, after his collapse and a stay in the hospital, where he refused to [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3307.6s)]
*  allow himself to be treated until the hospital agreed to stop segregating Negro patients, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3313.0s)]
*  his doctors instructed him to take it easy for a while. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3318.6s)]
*  He took an extended vacation that doubled as a scouting mission to go find a new location [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3321.4s)]
*  for his church that would be safe from nuclear war. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3326.52s)]
*  And yet there are questions whose answers in the mainstream Jim Jones biographies don't [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3331.08s)]
*  make a whole lot of sense. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3337.92s)]
*  If his goal was to find a safe haven from nuclear war for his people, he went about [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3340.2s)]
*  it in a very strange way. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3344.92s)]
*  Start there. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3346.2s)]
*  His first stop after he departed in late October 1961, again according to the mainstream accounts, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3347.92s)]
*  was the Hawaiian island of Oahu. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3353.56s)]
*  That's where Pearl Harbor is. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3355.4s)]
*  He's supposed to have stayed for a few months and even to have tried to get a job teaching [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3358.04s)]
*  at an outreach church there, but you've got to wonder what would have given them the idea [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3361.68s)]
*  that Hawaii would make a good place to take refuge from nuclear war, given that it was [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3366.72s)]
*  home to the US Navy's Pacific Fleet and within his living memory had been the target of military [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3371.98s)]
*  attack. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3377.2s)]
*  If there was a nuclear exchange, that island is one of the first places on the list. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3378.2s)]
*  So after a few months in Hawaii, again according to the mainstream accounts, Jim is supposed [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3384.06s)]
*  to have seen the February 1962 edition of Esquire magazine, which had a cover story [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3390.58s)]
*  describing the nine safest places in the event of nuclear war, several of which were in the [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3395.58s)]
*  global south. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3400.86s)]
*  And so he takes his family, which had joined him by this point, and they made a few very [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3401.86s)]
*  brief stops in Southern California and Mexico City on route to Guyana on the South American [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3406.2599999999998s)]
*  Caribbean coast. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3411.72s)]
*  This is around February of 62, and Jim is supposed to have stayed in Guyana for about a month and a half, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3414.16s)]
*  maybe two months. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3419.2799999999997s)]
*  Very little is known about what he wanted there, except that while he was there, he took the time [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3422.0s)]
*  to put on a handful of his tent revival shows, complete with faith healings and all the rest, and [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3426.96s)]
*  in which he delivered a series of anti-communist speeches. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3432.44s)]
*  Very strange, given what we know of Jim Jones' ideological commitments, although later on, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3436.28s)]
*  a Guyanese man who was present at one of the speeches, he was interviewed about it, and [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3442.1200000000003s)]
*  he said they weren't so much anti-communist as anti-Soviet, and that Jim was preaching [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3447.52s)]
*  his version of religious communitarianism as an alternative to Soviet state communism. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3451.76s)]
*  So that's fine, that's pretty plausible. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3457.36s)]
*  But still, it's a strange thing for Jim to be doing, and you wonder how during such a [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3460.4s)]
*  short stay, he managed to organize the events, or if the events were organized by other people, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3466.36s)]
*  how this random, newly arrived American preacher, tourist who was just passing through, managed [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3472.04s)]
*  to identify them, find them, and work his way onto the speakers list. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3477.84s)]
*  And why, if Jim was supposed to be on a doctor-ordered sabbatical to get away from his [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3483.36s)]
*  duties as a preacher, was he looking for opportunities like that in the first place? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3488.2s)]
*  The dearth of reliable information from this period, and the implausible and contradictory [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3494.08s)]
*  stories that Jim Jones would tell about it later, that's why this has been a primary [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3499.04s)]
*  wellspring of all the conspiracy theories about Jim Jones and People's Temple. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3503.8799999999997s)]
*  And there are a lot of them. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3507.6s)]
*  I don't want to go too far down the rabbit hole, at least not yet, but I might as well [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3509.56s)]
*  cover it a bit, since some of you have asked for it, and I've already started. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3514.84s)]
*  You can start with the fact that the timeline, the mainstream timeline, doesn't make any [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3519.6800000000003s)]
*  sense, the one I just described. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3523.6800000000003s)]
*  The author, Tim Ryderman, is probably Jim Jones' most thorough biographer. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3526.0s)]
*  No disrespect to Jeff Gwynn, his book is fine as well. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3531.7200000000003s)]
*  And Ryderman lays out the mainstream timeline the way I described it above. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3534.96s)]
*  Jim Jones leaves Indianapolis in October 1961 for Hawaii, stays for a few months until [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3539.16s)]
*  he sees the February 62 Esquire article, leaves Hawaii, goes to Guyana with brief stops in [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3545.56s)]
*  SoCal and Mexico City, stays for about a month and a half in Guyana until he arrives in Brazil [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3551.64s)]
*  on April 11, 1962, which we know is true because it was tracked, it's in Brazilian travel records. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3556.8799999999997s)]
*  The problem is that Jim Jones' anti-communist speeches in Guyana were recorded in a local [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3566.52s)]
*  newspaper on October 25, 1961, when he was supposed to have been just arriving in Hawaii. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3571.8s)]
*  If Jim is already in Guyana in late October 1961, it means that the reason given for going [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3580.8s)]
*  to South America in the first place, the Esquire magazine article, could not have been the [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3587.7599999999998s)]
*  real reason because that didn't come out until February of 62. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3591.3999999999996s)]
*  After the newspaper recording of Jim preaching in Guyana in late October of 61, we don't [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3596.8799999999997s)]
*  have any other public record of what he's up to until he shows up in Brazil in April [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3601.8799999999997s)]
*  of 62, that's a six month period or so. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3607.24s)]
*  There's an anthropologist named Kathleen Adams and she wrote that Jim Jones had done missionary [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3610.2s)]
*  work in the Northwest Territory of Guyana at some point in his life, but she doesn't [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3617.48s)]
*  say when this might have happened or where she got this information and I haven't been [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3621.76s)]
*  able to figure that out. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3625.12s)]
*  His timeline before and after this period, Jim Jones' life before it and after it are [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3627.84s)]
*  pretty well documented and if this period of missionary work had taken place during [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3632.28s)]
*  any period before or after this, it would probably be easy to find out. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3639.36s)]
*  So if she is right that he had done that work, this five or six month dark period from [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3643.16s)]
*  October of 61 to April of 62 is probably the best candidate for when it would have occurred. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3647.7999999999997s)]
*  There's one record of Jim Jones' public activity during that period actually. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3655.8799999999997s)]
*  In January of 62, he's issued a passport back in Indianapolis and it's unclear exactly [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3659.92s)]
*  what's going on here because Jim Jones already has an active passport by this point and there's [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3667.0s)]
*  no record of him returning to the U.S. to apply for or pick up this second passport, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3671.64s)]
*  but we'll come back to that in a few minutes. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3677.56s)]
*  It's probably worth saying a couple words about what's going on in Guyana at the time [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3681.2799999999997s)]
*  that Jim would have been there. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3684.96s)]
*  At the time, Guyana was still a British territory, but everybody could see the writing on the [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3686.3199999999997s)]
*  wall as the last of the colonies around the world were working their way toward independence. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3690.24s)]
*  We'll talk more about Guyana in the final episode of this series, but for now what we [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3696.24s)]
*  care about is this. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3700.26s)]
*  With independence clearly on the way, Western intelligence agencies, primarily the British [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3701.6800000000003s)]
*  and the Americans, are competing in a place like Guyana with Soviet spies for the loyalties [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3707.1400000000003s)]
*  of various factions within the country, hoping that the country, once independence occurs, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3713.42s)]
*  will be aligned with their side. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3717.78s)]
*  The last thing that the United States wanted was another Cuba on the Caribbean and so the [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3719.5400000000004s)]
*  CIA was heavily embedded trying to make sure that that didn't happen. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3724.78s)]
*  You can probably see where I'm going with this. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3730.3399999999997s)]
*  Jim Jones shows up in a place like that giving anti-communist, anti-Soviet speeches. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3732.3399999999997s)]
*  The most popular Jonestown conspiracy theory is that far from being an anti-American communist [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3737.3399999999997s)]
*  revolutionary, Jim Jones was actually working with the CIA or US intelligence and law enforcement [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3742.7799999999997s)]
*  more broadly to infiltrate and inform on and damage the political left. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3748.54s)]
*  Conspiracy theories live in the gaps contained within a narrative. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3754.3399999999997s)]
*  Filling those gaps in with explanations that latch on to the available true information [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3759.54s)]
*  and connect each known fact together into a coherent story. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3765.2599999999998s)]
*  They proliferate most easily when the subject itself is one where deception is a major factor, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3769.62s)]
*  as with intelligence operations, because there are bound to be gaps, and points where the [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3775.14s)]
*  given explanations are eventually exposed as contradictions or lies. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3780.66s)]
*  The case of Jonestown is a heaven for a conspiracy theorist because pretty much everybody who [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3786.74s)]
*  was involved in anything more than a superficial way died in a mass suicide. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3791.74s)]
*  See according to this theory, Jones being a CIA asset offers the best explanation for [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3798.74s)]
*  things like how he managed to come up with $50,000 to buy his people's temple building [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3803.22s)]
*  in Indianapolis in 1956. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3808.1s)]
*  An amount that would be almost a half a million dollars today and which he paid off in just [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3810.7799999999997s)]
*  one year, despite back then having a relatively small, mostly poor black congregation providing [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3815.4199999999996s)]
*  the church's income. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3822.4199999999996s)]
*  According to the theory, it explains why he would leave his church to die on the vine [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3824.8999999999996s)]
*  for nearly two years while he visited Cold War hotspots in South America to give anti-communist [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3829.8999999999996s)]
*  speeches. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3834.7799999999997s)]
*  And it provides a better explanation for what he had been doing in Cuba that first time [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3836.2999999999997s)]
*  in early 1960 than the one that he gave as parishioners and which has come down as the [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3841.5s)]
*  mainstream version which Tim Ryderman provides in summary. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3846.3s)]
*  Again this is his earlier trip to Cuba, the one right after the revolution where he'd [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3850.82s)]
*  seen the bombings. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3853.98s)]
*  Ryderman writes, quote, apparently unable to convince enough Indianapolis blacks to [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3855.82s)]
*  devote themselves entirely and communally to people's temple, he says apparently because [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3861.38s)]
*  this is just speculation on his part. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3867.14s)]
*  He looked elsewhere for recruits. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3870.62s)]
*  He had been watching the Cuban Revolutionary struggle with great interest since Fidel Castro's [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3873.2599999999998s)]
*  overthrow of Batista in January 1959. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3877.2999999999997s)]
*  Reasoning that many black Cubans probably were eager to escape economic chaos and austerity [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3881.2599999999998s)]
*  following the revolution, he seized on an idea. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3885.94s)]
*  He could speed up his plan to build a communal organization in the United States by recruiting [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3889.64s)]
*  Cuban blacks to live in Indiana. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3894.02s)]
*  Living in Cuba in early 1960, Jones first staked out the Havana Hilton in search of [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3897.82s)]
*  a translator. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3902.82s)]
*  Looking like a camera-toting tourist, he called out a friendly hello to a black man. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3904.78s)]
*  The man, Carlos Foster, was a Cuban of Jamaican descent and was receptive to Jones' overtures. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3909.94s)]
*  Jones introduced himself as an evangelical minister and part-time nightclub singer. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3917.2200000000003s)]
*  Ryderman seems to be mistaken here. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3922.38s)]
*  It was actually the Cuban, Carlos Foster, who was the part-time nightclub singer. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3923.92s)]
*  He offered Foster $24 a day and promised to send him to the United States if he would [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3929.48s)]
*  help with the recruitment plan. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3934.04s)]
*  Foster wanted to join his fiancee in the United States and so agreed to act as a sort of executive [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3936.52s)]
*  confidant for Jones. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3941.34s)]
*  Jones took the Cuban to a hotel room and spent a week, from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., briefing him, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3944.44s)]
*  even sending out for meals through room service. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3951.24s)]
*  The plan was to bring 40 Cuban black families to America to work on communal farms financed [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3954.3599999999997s)]
*  by his Indiana congregation. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3959.68s)]
*  After the briefings, Jones and Foster went to the slum areas of Havana and interviewed [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3962.72s)]
*  dozens of families. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3967.24s)]
*  Once they had collected the names and addresses of 15 that were receptive to the plan, Jones [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3969.4399999999996s)]
*  headed home, but before leaving Cuba, he told Foster to carry on until he had gathered names [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3974.12s)]
*  of an additional 25 families. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3978.98s)]
*  Back in the States, Jones revealed little of his plan, depicting his stay more as tourism [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3982.18s)]
*  than church business. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3987.54s)]
*  Four months later, Jones sponsored Carlos Foster's trip to Indianapolis, alone, without [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3989.62s)]
*  the families. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3994.94s)]
*  The black Cuban mostly stayed indoors at the Jones home because Jones had cautioned him [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=3996.72s)]
*  that white middle-class neighbors might lynch him if he left the house alone. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4000.94s)]
*  Jones' plan was not actively pursued. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4005.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, Foster felt like a virtual prisoner. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4008.42s)]
*  Jones would not allow him to find a job, although he compelled him to take part in church services. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4011.82s)]
*  Jones' assistant pastor thought that Jones' Cuban friend had no interest at all in the [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4018.06s)]
*  temple, and he was right. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4021.5800000000004s)]
*  After two months, Foster left to see his fiancé in New York, and Jones never heard from him [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4023.52s)]
*  again. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4028.02s)]
*  I'm sorry, but that whole story just sounds ridiculous to me. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4031.02s)]
*  He travels to Cuba under false pretenses, telling everyone back home it's just a vacation. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4036.02s)]
*  He gets a room at the Havana Hilton and pulls some random guy off the street, offers him [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4041.94s)]
*  what would be the equivalent of over $200 a day to huddle in a room with him from 7am [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4047.18s)]
*  to 8pm every day for an entire week just to discuss a plan to bring 40 families to the [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4053.42s)]
*  U.S. to work on communal farms in Indiana. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4059.02s)]
*  There are more holes in that story than I can cover without sounding like a conspiracy [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4062.38s)]
*  theorist myself. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4065.82s)]
*  For one, there's no accounting how the two men communicated while they were huddled in [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4067.5s)]
*  the room planning all week. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4071.86s)]
*  Jones didn't speak Spanish, and we know from a later interview with Foster himself that [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4073.1s)]
*  he didn't speak English at the time. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4078.2599999999998s)]
*  He learned English later, after he was in the United States, at Teddy Roosevelt High [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4080.08s)]
*  School in the Bronx. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4084.1s)]
*  He said that he and Jones communicated using Jones' broken Spanish. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4086.1s)]
*  No one who knew Jones ever said he spoke any Spanish, but fine, let's get past that part. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4094.14s)]
*  He was supposed to be looking to recruit 40 families, 40 black Cuban families, to work [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4100.88s)]
*  on communal farms in Indiana, but as Ryderman himself notes, the church did not have anywhere [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4106.58s)]
*  near the resources to finance something like that, not remotely close to it. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4112.38s)]
*  He's got a couple hundred members of his church at this point. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4119.34s)]
*  Most of them are poor black people in Indiana, in Indianapolis. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4121.9800000000005s)]
*  In his interview with the New York Times later, after the mass suicide, Carlos Foster, the [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4127.5s)]
*  Cuban, he said that Jim Jones offered him $50,000 a year to help establish agricultural communes [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4132.46s)]
*  in various countries in Central and South America. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4139.68s)]
*  That's not in today's money, that's back then. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4143.16s)]
*  That's about $450,000 a year in today's money. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4145.1s)]
*  Astronomically more than the church could afford. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4149.240000000001s)]
*  Not even in the same universe as what the church could afford. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4151.8s)]
*  And completely outside of the church's purpose or mission in 1960. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4156.72s)]
*  And even if we ignore the fact that later, we ignore that later interview with Foster, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4160.320000000001s)]
*  and just take the story in Ryderman's and others biographies. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4167.88s)]
*  Forget about Foster's interview and that part about paying him half a million dollars to [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4170.72s)]
*  set up camps all over Central and South America. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4175.34s)]
*  Just the part about the 40 families and the communal farms. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4179.06s)]
*  How could he be off in Cuba, actively recruiting people for this project without having brought [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4181.88s)]
*  it up to anyone in his congregation? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4187.32s)]
*  And hiding the whole purpose of his trip from them, if they were going to be the ones paying [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4189.76s)]
*  for it? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4193.36s)]
*  In later years, Jones would brag to his congregation about every humanitarian project or idea he [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4195.76s)]
*  had, whether or not they ever came to fruition. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4202.0s)]
*  Every idea he had, he would tell them about it, just because it made him sound humanitarian [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4206.24s)]
*  and compassionate. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4210.12s)]
*  It seems unlikely that he would hide this from everyone, including his closest advisors [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4211.400000000001s)]
*  and assistant pastors, and was just planning on showing up one day with a few hundred Spanish-speaking [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4216.34s)]
*  Cubans in Indiana to inform his Indianapolis congregation that they needed to find and [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4222.259999999999s)]
*  purchase farms to put them on. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4227.78s)]
*  The whole story is preposterous, and it leaves you to wonder what was he actually doing in [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4230.0599999999995s)]
*  Cuba during that visit? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4235.5s)]
*  Especially considering the political situation at the time, and the fact that the place was [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4238.139999999999s)]
*  crawling with intelligence agents from all over the world. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4242.639999999999s)]
*  This was before Castro had officially declared for the Soviet Union. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4246.98s)]
*  People were trying to feel him out, and maybe vying for his loyalty. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4250.46s)]
*  He hadn't been declared an enemy of the United States yet, and it's well known that the Havana [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4254.14s)]
*  Hilton was the place where American, British, and other Soviet intelligence agents would [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4258.5s)]
*  congregate. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4266.3s)]
*  So, that's in early 1960. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4267.3s)]
*  He comes back from Cuba to Indianapolis, and the mayor of Indianapolis creates the position [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4270.62s)]
*  of director of the Indian Human Rights Commission, which goes to Jones without competition. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4274.7s)]
*  He was the only applicant, another kind of odd point, considering the position paid [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4280.06s)]
*  over $60,000 a year in today's dollars. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4283.96s)]
*  It wouldn't make you rich, but you would expect more than one applicant for a part-time gig, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4286.820000000001s)]
*  which the mayor himself encouraged to be low-profile and mostly ceremonial. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4292.38s)]
*  It wasn't a lot of work for that money. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4295.9800000000005s)]
*  After Jim Jones becomes the human rights director, his profile predictably grows, almost as if [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4299.860000000001s)]
*  it was a plan. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4305.26s)]
*  If you're into the conspiracy theories, he begins to be able to make contact with regional [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4306.66s)]
*  leaders in the civil rights movement, who were at the time of great interest to federal [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4311.26s)]
*  law enforcement and intelligence agencies. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4316.08s)]
*  Jim also tried to make contact with other groups and individuals in whom federal authorities [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4319.46s)]
*  might be interested, like the Nation of Islam and the American Nazi Party. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4324.54s)]
*  Over this period of time, right during this period of time, all the people around him [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4330.42s)]
*  reported that he was becoming extremely stressed out and paranoid in a way that they'd never [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4335.94s)]
*  seen before, to the point of being hospitalized for ulcers and suffering what sounds a lot [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4340.259999999999s)]
*  like a nervous breakdown. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4345.0599999999995s)]
*  And then with his church exploding in popularity, again, often getting almost 2,000 people to [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4348.0599999999995s)]
*  his services on Sundays, and his status in Indianapolis rising as the human rights director [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4355.54s)]
*  and the church operating a very popular soup kitchen and elderly homes and jobs programs [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4363.099999999999s)]
*  and more, everything that he wanted to do, and Jim's head swimming with ambitions about [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4368.299999999999s)]
*  emulating or taking over Father Divine's peace mission, suddenly just as things are getting [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4372.82s)]
*  going, just eight months after being appointed the human rights director for a major American [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4377.62s)]
*  city, he leaves it all behind on the very thin pretext of scouting a safe haven from [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4382.66s)]
*  nuclear war and turns up within a week making anti-communist speeches in Guyana. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4388.54s)]
*  And after doing who knows what for six months, on April 11th, 1962, he shows up in Belo Horizonte, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4395.54s)]
*  Brazil, and that's when things actually get very weird. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4402.54s)]
*  At the time, Brazil had a very shaky democratic government, and the United States had established [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4407.98s)]
*  a program to develop and train Brazil's paramilitary police forces and counterinsurgency methods [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4413.58s)]
*  and to fight communists and other revolutionaries and insurgent groups. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4418.86s)]
*  We were doing this in a lot of Latin American countries at the time under the authority [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4424.18s)]
*  of the Office of Public Safety, which itself fell under the authority of USAID, the Agency [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4427.62s)]
*  for International Development. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4432.78s)]
*  In reality, the Office of Public Safety was a cover for CIA operations, which included [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4435.34s)]
*  training local forces in torture and assassination techniques. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4441.82s)]
*  This all came out later in 1974 and forced the program to be shut down. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4445.0199999999995s)]
*  The OPS was established in Brazil in August 1961, just two months before Jones arrived [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4451.18s)]
*  to Belo Horizonte. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4457.88s)]
*  And just before that, in the same Brazilian city, in preparation for the establishment [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4460.74s)]
*  of the program, a U.S. official named Dan Mitrione arrived and set up shop at the U.S. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4465.74s)]
*  Consulate. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4471.34s)]
*  Dan Mitrione had been a 28-year-old youth police officer with the Richmond, Indiana [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4472.34s)]
*  police force in 1948 when Jim Jones was a 16-year-old high school kid preaching on a [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4477.54s)]
*  corner in the black neighborhood of that same small Indiana town. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4483.66s)]
*  Mitrione was the son of Italian immigrants. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4489.62s)]
*  It was a segregated city, not just for blacks, but there was an Italian neighborhood as well. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4494.74s)]
*  He lived on the north side Italian neighborhood that was directly adjacent to the black section [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4498.94s)]
*  of town. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4503.219999999999s)]
*  He and his family passed and walked alongside their black neighbors on the way to church [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4505.26s)]
*  every Sunday. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4508.98s)]
*  A white high school kid preaching to drunks, leaving their watering holes on the black [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4510.9s)]
*  side of town was a curious sight and something that a youth police officer from the adjacent [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4519.38s)]
*  neighborhood over would notice, and Dan Mitrione did notice it, and Jim Jones and Dan Mitrione [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4523.700000000001s)]
*  got to know each other. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4529.580000000001s)]
*  We know that. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4530.700000000001s)]
*  They maintained some level of contact after Jim left Richmond for Indianapolis. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4532.42s)]
*  Jim's mother and his wife Marceline's parents still lived in Richmond, and Jim and Marceline [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4538.900000000001s)]
*  visited there often, so he maintained some kind of contact with Mitrione. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4542.660000000001s)]
*  In 1955, Dan Mitrione was made chief of the Richmond police force, and in 1960 he took [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4547.9s)]
*  a job with the federal government, officially with the OPS under USAID, but generally accepted [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4553.379999999999s)]
*  today to have been working for the CIA, teaching advanced interrogation techniques and counterinsurgency [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4558.66s)]
*  tactics to the Brazilian police in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4564.259999999999s)]
*  In the course of time, largely thanks to the book Hidden Terrors by the New York Times [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4569.419999999999s)]
*  reporter A.J. Langouth, which is how I had originally heard of Mitrione years ago, before [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4575.94s)]
*  I'd ever read anything about Jonestown. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4580.66s)]
*  It's funny, none of the Jonestown biographies mention Dan Mitrione. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4582.54s)]
*  It was only because I had read Langouth's book about him years before that when I started [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4587.82s)]
*  researching Jim Jones and saw that he'd come from Richmond, Indiana, that I thought, huh, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4592.24s)]
*  isn't that where Dan Mitrione was chief of police? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4597.58s)]
*  And then I saw that Jim Jones left to spend time in the same places in Brazil during the [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4600.38s)]
*  same periods that Mitrione was working there, and I thought, huh, okay, well that's interesting. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4606.34s)]
*  And then I'm going through and reading all the source material from Jonestown and listening [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4613.42s)]
*  to Jones' speeches, and he's talking about having met up with the Mitrione family while [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4617.66s)]
*  they were down there. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4622.06s)]
*  It's all very strange. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4624.54s)]
*  It's at least worth mentioning in the Jones biographies, but I think most writers covering [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4626.98s)]
*  his life just don't want to get sidetracked or pigeonholed as conspiracy theorists, or [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4630.9s)]
*  maybe they just don't have any point of reference when he mentions Mitrione, so they leave it [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4636.66s)]
*  alone. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4640.259999999999s)]
*  Anyway, largely thanks to A.J. Langouth's book and the very public manner of Mitrione's [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4641.82s)]
*  eventual death, Mitrione would become one of the most notorious individuals in that program [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4648.259999999999s)]
*  for coldly and meticulously instructing officers in techniques of torture, including beatings, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4654.86s)]
*  using tools like pliers and hammers and electric shocks, you know the drill. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4661.099999999999s)]
*  His method of interrogation, he said matter of factly once, was to apply precise pain [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4666.98s)]
*  in the precise place, in the precise amount to achieve the desired effect. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4672.78s)]
*  So Jim Jones, in the course of abandoning his church for nearly two years, and after [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4679.18s)]
*  showing up in Guyana delivering anti-communist speeches, arrives in the same Brazilian city, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4685.46s)]
*  living in an adjacent neighborhood to a reputed CIA torture instructor that he'd known since [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4691.900000000001s)]
*  childhood. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4696.700000000001s)]
*  We know from Jim's own later account that he was aware of Mitrione's presence in the [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4698.9800000000005s)]
*  city and that he sought him out. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4703.900000000001s)]
*  He claims not to have met Mitrione himself there, but said that he and his family often [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4705.58s)]
*  met with Mitrione's family for dinner and other social things. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4710.66s)]
*  What exactly Jim Jones was doing in Brazil, or is supposed to have been doing for the [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4716.42s)]
*  year plus that he was in the country is a mystery. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4721.18s)]
*  He spoke no Portuguese, he never learned a bit of Portuguese, couldn't communicate [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4724.5s)]
*  with any of the locals. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4729.8s)]
*  It's unclear what he did for money, although he was living in a nice part of town. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4731.54s)]
*  His neighbors were lawyers and engineers and other professionals, we know that, they were [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4737.38s)]
*  interviewed later after the suicide and they remembered Jim. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4741.98s)]
*  Jones biographer Jeff Gwynn writes that from the time Jones had arrived in Brazil, people's [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4747.98s)]
*  temple back home were having trouble covering its expenses because members and their donations [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4752.58s)]
*  were heading for the exits once it was clear that Jim wasn't coming back anytime soon. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4758.78s)]
*  Gwynn says that the church never sent Jim Jones a dime while he was down there. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4763.42s)]
*  He told his neighbors all sorts of different stories about what he was doing down there [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4768.78s)]
*  and how he supported himself. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4773.179999999999s)]
*  He told one neighbor that he'd been a captain in the US Navy who was injured during the [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4774.58s)]
*  Korean War and that he was living on a medical pension. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4778.9s)]
*  He told another neighbor that he worked as a technician of some kind for Brazil's largest [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4782.139999999999s)]
*  chain of laundromats, but he never worked in any capacity for the company, we know that. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4786.7s)]
*  It's very strange that he would dissimulate about his purpose in Brazil if he was trying [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4793.86s)]
*  to find a place to move his church and to build a little following down there. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4797.62s)]
*  That was the story that he gave people back in the US. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4802.54s)]
*  You would think that he'd be trying to make connections, get to know people who could [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4804.74s)]
*  teach him the lay of the land and introduce him to some of the people that he'd need to [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4808.18s)]
*  meet in order to get something like that going. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4812.139999999999s)]
*  Again, he didn't speak any Portuguese, so he would need help getting around and figuring [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4815.26s)]
*  things out. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4819.860000000001s)]
*  You would think that his neighbors would be the most obvious people to tap into for assistance, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4820.860000000001s)]
*  so it's hard to figure out why he would make up a bunch of different weird stories about [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4824.66s)]
*  what he was doing there. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4828.14s)]
*  One neighbor, an engineer whose wife was a lawyer, he said that on most days Jim would [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4830.9400000000005s)]
*  leave the house early in the morning in a car that looked like it was from the US consulate [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4836.46s)]
*  and that he wouldn't come back until late in the evening. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4840.900000000001s)]
*  Perhaps that car would deliver groceries and other things to the Jones residence. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4844.1s)]
*  So in October of 1962, Jim's been away for a year at this point, and in Brazil for six [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4849.3s)]
*  months, Dan Mitrione leaves Brazil for the United States, officially for two months of [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4857.740000000001s)]
*  vacation. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4862.900000000001s)]
*  That same month, Jim Jones gets a letter from the US consulate. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4864.820000000001s)]
*  It was from Vice Consul John Ladeason, a Russian-speaking US intelligence officer, and it was written [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4869.1s)]
*  on official consulate stationery. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4874.660000000001s)]
*  Dear Mr. Jones, We received a communication and believe it's in your interest to come [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4877.5s)]
*  to the consulate at your earliest convenience. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4883.54s)]
*  Please see me. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4886.26s)]
*  Attached to the letter is a photograph that I have tried hard to see myself, but I have [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4888.3s)]
*  not been able to, but it has been entered into court records and has been seen by other [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4892.820000000001s)]
*  people and described, and it's described as a passport-style photograph of someone [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4898.1s)]
*  who looks very much like Jim Jones, except with a mustache and a receding hairline. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4902.6s)]
*  It's been described as looking like Jim Jones in a disguise. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4908.9400000000005s)]
*  I mentioned earlier the curious fact that Jim Jones had been issued two passports, one [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4913.22s)]
*  of them when he was known to have been outside the United States in January 1962. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4918.4400000000005s)]
*  Some people have tried to make a connection with this letter from the consulate, but the [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4924.24s)]
*  truth is we just don't have a lot of information about it. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4928.92s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4932.0s)]
*  I don't want to say anything about that. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4933.0s)]
*  While Dan Mitrione is gone, again, he's back in the United States from October to December [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4935.4s)]
*  1962, supposedly on vacation, and in November it's been established that the CIA opens a [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4941.28s)]
*  file on Jim Jones and that the agency's Office of Security sent agents to the State Department [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4948.8s)]
*  to review his passport file. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4953.82s)]
*  When Mitrione gets back to Brazil in December, he moves to Rio. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4955.9s)]
*  That same month, Jim Jones and his family move from Belo Horizonte to Rio. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4961.46s)]
*  In Rio, Jim Jones and his family live in a large seventh-floor condo in one of the city's [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4967.98s)]
*  most expensive neighborhoods, three blocks from Copacabana Beach, which is hard to explain [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4974.5s)]
*  because by this time we know for certain, if it wasn't necessarily true before at this [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4979.54s)]
*  point, we know for certain that the church back in Indiana is basically in total collapse. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4985.9s)]
*  Without Jim there to draw in the crowds, the weekly congregation has shrunk from nearly [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4990.82s)]
*  2,000 people to just under 100 people, just some of Jim's diehard loyalists. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=4995.18s)]
*  We know from the pleading letters being sent by his assistants that the church was behind [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5002.42s)]
*  on water and electricity payments. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5007.82s)]
*  There were threats to shut them off throughout the year, so the church was not sending Jim [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5009.58s)]
*  Jones any money. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5013.74s)]
*  Jim Jones' explanation for how he and his family were living so well during this period [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5016.259999999999s)]
*  became a Jonestown legend. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5020.219999999999s)]
*  According to Jim, the wife of an American diplomat became so infatuated with him that [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5021.94s)]
*  she offered him $5,000 if he would sleep with her. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5029.98s)]
*  That's over 40 grand today. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5033.98s)]
*  He says that of course he was scandalized by this indecent proposal, but he thought [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5036.58s)]
*  he might be able to use some of that money to feed poor Brazilian orphans, and so he [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5041.78s)]
*  discussed the matter with his wife Marceline, and with her approval he reluctantly took [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5045.7s)]
*  one for the team. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5050.8s)]
*  Obviously a ridiculous story, not one that I feel any obligation to take seriously. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5053.099999999999s)]
*  Brazilian immigration authorities had a record of Jim Jones leaving the country in March [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5060.66s)]
*  1963, and we don't have any record of him returning, but we know that he got back to [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5065.42s)]
*  Rio at some point because he and his family flew home from there December 1963, the month [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5069.820000000001s)]
*  after Kennedy was shot. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5075.580000000001s)]
*  So what's going on? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5078.42s)]
*  It is all very strange, and this is one of those ones where I can understand why people [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5080.780000000001s)]
*  have so much fun with it. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5085.34s)]
*  There are contradictions and so many things that make no sense in the mainstream explanations, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5086.620000000001s)]
*  and there are a lot of coincidences, especially when you set all this against the backdrop [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5094.0199999999995s)]
*  of political events in Brazil at the time. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5098.0199999999995s)]
*  Two months before Jim Jones begins his overseas tour, the resilient president resigns his [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5101.54s)]
*  position in the mistaken belief that it was going to precipitate mass demonstrations in [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5106.3s)]
*  support of him, calling for him to be restored to office, and that he'd come back with increased [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5110.98s)]
*  popularity and power. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5115.34s)]
*  So there's a lot of miscalculation. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5118.419999999999s)]
*  That did not happen, and so the presidency fell to his vice president, Joao Goulart, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5119.419999999999s)]
*  but Goulart's out of the country at the time. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5124.66s)]
*  Now Goulart is viewed by the Kennedy administration and conservative elements within Brazil as [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5127.379999999999s)]
*  a disruptive leftist, and so there's a lot of back and forth over how his powers might [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5132.219999999999s)]
*  be limited or whether he'd even be allowed to take office at all. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5136.98s)]
*  The U.S. is making a final decision about what to do about Goulart during Mitrione's [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5142.179999999999s)]
*  supposed two month vacation back in the U.S., and in December 1962, the month that Mitrione [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5146.54s)]
*  came back and the month that both he and Jim Jones moved from Belo Horizonte to Rio, the [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5153.66s)]
*  president's brother, Bobby Kennedy, the attorney general at the time, he also flew out to Rio [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5159.78s)]
*  to meet with Joao Goulart. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5164.82s)]
*  Kennedy outlined the Americans' concerns, but he and the Brazilian president did not [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5168.94s)]
*  see eye to eye at all and nothing was accomplished. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5173.58s)]
*  A few weeks later, Joao Goulart assumed the full powers of the presidency of Brazil, and [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5176.7s)]
*  two months later, by March 1963, the month that Brazilian immigration records show Jim [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5181.54s)]
*  Jones as having been out of the country, the CIA begins making plans for a coup led by [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5187.9s)]
*  the Brazilian military. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5192.74s)]
*  By the final months of that year, coup supporters and fighters within Brazil were being recruited [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5195.82s)]
*  and organized, and when Jim Jones left Brazil for the final time in December 1963, the plans [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5201.46s)]
*  had been finalized and they were just waiting for the right moment, waiting for the initiative [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5207.74s)]
*  of the Brazilian military officers, and on March 31, 1964, with American support, the [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5211.86s)]
*  coup was executed and Goulart had to flee the country. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5218.5s)]
*  Now the maximalist version of the conspiracy theory is that Jim Jones was recruited to [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5223.3s)]
*  work as a CIA asset and that his handler was Dan Mitrione. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5229.22s)]
*  He followed Mitrione to Belo Horizonte, perhaps to use the cover of a religious missionary [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5233.8s)]
*  to make connections and try to provide some street level intelligence in support of Mitrione's [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5239.16s)]
*  overall anti-communist work with the Brazilian police. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5244.1s)]
*  He follows Mitrione from Belo Horizonte to Rio to continue his work, and when the preparations [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5248.360000000001s)]
*  for the coup are complete, only waiting for the trigger pullers to pull their triggers, [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5253.780000000001s)]
*  Jim's work was done and so he heads back to the United States. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5259.02s)]
*  They put a big fat cherry on top of the whole thing. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5262.02s)]
*  We know that Jim Jones' file with the CIA was purged in 1970 after Dan Mitrione was [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5266.26s)]
*  kidnapped and murdered by Tupamar O'Gorillaz and Paraguay. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5272.1s)]
*  It was where Mitrione was working by that point. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5275.34s)]
*  The flat earth, fake moon landing types, they run this theory all the way to the end, positing [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5279.700000000001s)]
*  that the whole subsequent People's Temple experience, right down to the final conflagration, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5285.34s)]
*  was some kind of MKUltra mind control experiment that either went sideways or, in some versions [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5290.78s)]
*  of it, worked exactly as it was supposed to and was terminated when its usefulness had [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5296.860000000001s)]
*  run its course, the way you'd dispose of used up lab rats. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5301.26s)]
*  I tried to do this stuff justice. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5307.9800000000005s)]
*  I spent a lot of time grappling with this stuff. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5310.3s)]
*  I didn't just dismiss it. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5312.9800000000005s)]
*  I spent too long on it. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5315.02s)]
*  It distracted me probably more than it should have. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5316.8s)]
*  Not so much because I believed in the maximalist conspiracy theories and I don't want to poo [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5321.1s)]
*  poo them too much because they're a lot of fun, but because if you leave off the stuff [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5327.18s)]
*  at the end about MKUltra and all the rest of that, it's about as good of a story as [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5331.42s)]
*  the bullshit one that passes in the mainstream biographies. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5336.02s)]
*  There are just too many holes in the story. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5339.88s)]
*  The mainstream story doesn't even mention Mitrione. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5342.3s)]
*  How can you not mention that crazy aspect of it? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5344.7s)]
*  It just kind of accepts at face value Jim's explanations for what he was doing in Cuba, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5347.94s)]
*  trying to recruit families for communal farms that his church couldn't afford and his spotty [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5352.42s)]
*  and inconsistent reasons for being in Brazil. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5358.0599999999995s)]
*  But after thinking about it for a long time, I think there's probably a simpler explanation. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5362.22s)]
*  Mental illness is not like catching a virus in the sense of now you have it and now you [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5369.74s)]
*  don't. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5373.9s)]
*  It exists along a blended continuum consisting of several behavioral and experiential dimensions. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5376.299999999999s)]
*  If we insist on likening it to an illness, maybe it's less like a virus than inflammation. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5384.32s)]
*  Everybody has some inflammation, some things that make it worse and those things depend [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5390.299999999999s)]
*  on the individual and the environment. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5394.54s)]
*  It can often just be seen as a normal part of life, just a chronic part of life until [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5397.339999999999s)]
*  it breaks past a certain threshold and starts to cause major breakdowns. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5401.9s)]
*  There are aspects of our personalities that can be drawn out or encouraged depending on [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5408.5s)]
*  what we're facing and what we're dealing with or experiencing in our lives. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5412.099999999999s)]
*  Some things drive us to paranoia, others don't. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5416.5s)]
*  With other people it's different and the causes are often hidden from us and just blend into [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5419.179999999999s)]
*  our personality over time and again are not necessarily even considered pathological until [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5422.92s)]
*  they go past certain thresholds and cause breakdowns. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5429.1s)]
*  Breakdowns meaning primarily our ability to function in the social world. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5433.820000000001s)]
*  There are people all around us who are paranoid, delusional, etc. on one issue or another or [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5439.9800000000005s)]
*  even in general who string together, who manage to keep it together enough to put together [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5445.540000000001s)]
*  something called a normal life until they finally encounter a situation where things [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5451.18s)]
*  escalate and it makes social and economic life untenable for them and then that's when [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5456.38s)]
*  we say, oh, that person's, they've lost it. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5460.38s)]
*  I knew a woman, a woman I was very close to. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5464.34s)]
*  I know her very well, very intelligent woman, but she'd had a difficult childhood and she [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5467.34s)]
*  had suffered from trauma in her life as an adult as well. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5473.02s)]
*  This woman is well-educated, master's degree, graduated with honors, very rational, sometimes [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5477.22s)]
*  to a fault I would say, and highly, highly functional. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5484.7s)]
*  One of those perfect rule-following dedicated employees in her professional civil service [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5491.06s)]
*  job that every manager dreams about. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5496.38s)]
*  That every once in a while something would poke through. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5500.5s)]
*  She had a touch of OCD that would give you a clue. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5504.7s)]
*  One day she was talking to me about work and she's telling me about one of the secretaries [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5508.52s)]
*  who she was just certain did not like her. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5513.46s)]
*  I couldn't get any kind of a good answer about how she knew that. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5516.94s)]
*  It just seemed to be from a tone of voice that she picked up some time or the way that [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5519.86s)]
*  she made a comment once or twice and then that shaped the way that my friend interpreted [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5525.12s)]
*  every subsequent interaction between the two. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5529.7s)]
*  My friend, mind you, is one of the supervisors at the place where she works, so there's really [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5532.4s)]
*  no reason for her to be worrying so much about what one of the secretaries thinks about her. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5536.78s)]
*  I told her that she's probably reading too much into it and I couldn't put her off the [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5542.84s)]
*  feeling though. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5546.8s)]
*  So today, the day she's telling me this story, the secretary had brought in some cookies [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5548.4400000000005s)]
*  for the people in the office, my friend's telling me. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5554.0s)]
*  But she said she had a weird feeling and so she just put it aside on her desk and later [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5557.56s)]
*  the secretary came by and was like, aren't you going to eat your cookie? [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5561.4800000000005s)]
*  I am telling you, they're so good. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5565.04s)]
*  My friend made some excuse and then waited until later and waited until nobody was around [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5567.8s)]
*  and then threw it away. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5573.02s)]
*  I'm just waiting for where this story is supposed to be going and my friend looks at me with [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5575.56s)]
*  complete seriousness and says, you don't think she was trying to poison me, do you? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5580.400000000001s)]
*  I looked at her right in the eyes and I said, listen to me, no, she was not trying to poison [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5588.04s)]
*  and do not say this to anyone else. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5595.46s)]
*  Do not repeat that. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5598.02s)]
*  And she just kind of shook her head like she was kind of shaking herself loose of the thought [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5600.46s)]
*  and her face softened a bit and she said, yeah, of course, I know that I'm just joking. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5604.82s)]
*  She was not joking. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5608.78s)]
*  Now, this woman, this friend of mine, I'm telling you, highly functional, very successful [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5610.82s)]
*  professional woman. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5618.22s)]
*  She gets through life just fine and yet that is a bat shit paranoid delusional thought [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5620.18s)]
*  to have seriously enter your head and to the point where she would express it verbally [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5627.26s)]
*  to somebody else. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5633.740000000001s)]
*  If she had said that to someone other than me, who knows what might happen? [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5635.58s)]
*  She was high enough in her profession. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5639.9800000000005s)]
*  It was a position involving government that she was interacting with people who were at [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5641.62s)]
*  the political level, local political level. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5646.38s)]
*  Even if she had gone to her bosses in a moment of irrationality and expressed her concerns [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5649.02s)]
*  to them, excuse me, sir, I think one of our secretaries is trying to poison me. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5654.42s)]
*  What? [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5660.22s)]
*  Why? [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5661.22s)]
*  Well, I know she doesn't like me. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5662.22s)]
*  How do you know that? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5663.580000000001s)]
*  It's hard to explain, but I can just tell. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5665.160000000001s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5667.660000000001s)]
*  She may have lost her job. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5669.18s)]
*  She may have been recommended for treatment. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5671.280000000001s)]
*  Word would have gotten around. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5673.42s)]
*  Her life may have been derailed in ways that might have been hard to recover from. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5674.64s)]
*  From there, once you're in that situation and you have this little grain of a mentality [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5679.68s)]
*  in there, who knows where our mind goes? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5686.9800000000005s)]
*  Are there more people who are in on this conspiracy? [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5688.88s)]
*  I'm not making light. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5692.12s)]
*  This happens to people and it's very serious and it's a very tragic thing. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5693.12s)]
*  We make jokes about mental illness. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5697.360000000001s)]
*  It's not a funny thing when you see it in real life when it spins out of control. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5698.88s)]
*  But sometimes it doesn't spin out of control. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5703.72s)]
*  This was years ago. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5707.56s)]
*  My friend is fine today. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5708.56s)]
*  But sometimes it's just a matter of chance how things fall. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5711.0s)]
*  I read about a young man in Washington, D.C. in one of the books I was reading for this. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5715.72s)]
*  Very smart, very good student, no signs of mental illness that anyone could remember. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5720.280000000001s)]
*  One day a very attractive female student who was failing a class that they were both in [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5726.320000000001s)]
*  approached him and began to make conversation, kind of flirting with him. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5731.5599999999995s)]
*  He was a nerd, very shy, and he was just completely bowled over by the sudden attention from this [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5735.28s)]
*  gorgeous woman. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5741.28s)]
*  She was not interested in him, but she was pretending to be interested in order to get [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5743.72s)]
*  him to help her study and write papers for her. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5746.96s)]
*  When the class finished and she got her passing grade, she just ghosted him without explanation [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5751.2s)]
*  and his mind just could not accept what had just happened. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5755.16s)]
*  He had fallen completely in love with this woman. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5758.839999999999s)]
*  He had never been popular, never had any attention from females. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5761.32s)]
*  Insecure, shy, and this woman's attention had just completely transformed his whole [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5765.4s)]
*  view of himself, what he was capable of, everything. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5771.44s)]
*  He loved her. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5775.28s)]
*  And that made it impossible for him to see anything but goodness and beauty in her. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5777.16s)]
*  So when she just left in such a cruel manner, he just could not compute that. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5781.16s)]
*  And instead, his mind somehow worked its way around to the conclusion that City Hall, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5786.04s)]
*  the Washington, D.C. city government, was engaged in a vast conspiracy against him and [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5791.48s)]
*  his love in order to keep them apart. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5796.32s)]
*  That's why she wasn't returning his calls or letters. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5799.4s)]
*  That's why when he tried to approach her in person, she acted very distant as if they'd [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5801.84s)]
*  hardly known each other at all. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5805.72s)]
*  Maybe she was being threatened by the mayor through the D.C. police. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5807.5199999999995s)]
*  Or worse, this is Washington, D.C., maybe even the federal government was in on it. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5810.44s)]
*  Craziness. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5815.96s)]
*  And by all accounts, this guy was not some delusional schizophrenic. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5818.0s)]
*  It took some time after he was institutionalized because giving up that delusion is hard. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5821.68s)]
*  Giving it up means admitting that this woman that he loved so much was actually a terrible [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5827.82s)]
*  person who had used him in a cynical and cruel way, and that the whole world that he had [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5833.12s)]
*  their relationship, all the changes to his personality and mentality that had happened [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5841.72s)]
*  as a result had been just as big of a delusion as the one that he was now inhabiting. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5846.72s)]
*  That's not easy. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5851.96s)]
*  And there's a reason people in the grip of paranoid delusions fight so hard to kind of [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5852.96s)]
*  hold on to them. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5857.96s)]
*  It's very difficult to dissuade them of things because the alternatives are often quite devastating [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5860.16s)]
*  as well. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5865.4400000000005s)]
*  And through therapy, he finally comes around to the truth. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5868.54s)]
*  He does what you would expect. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5872.900000000001s)]
*  He falls into a long-term crippling depression, which is, again, why he was fighting so hard [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5874.58s)]
*  to hold on to it because you could probably see over that edge. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5880.26s)]
*  But over time, he recovered. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5883.46s)]
*  And again, by all accounts, he did not seem to be suffering from an illness that we would [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5885.54s)]
*  describe as genetic or neurological. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5890.14s)]
*  He eventually became fine. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5892.1s)]
*  While I was thinking through all this stuff, it occurred to me to go back and read A Beautiful [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5895.74s)]
*  Mind, the book about the Nobel Prize-winning paranoid schizophrenic mathematician John Nash. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5900.179999999999s)]
*  The movie's all right, but it's not particularly helpful for what I needed from it. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5907.0599999999995s)]
*  I'd read the book before, and I knew there was a lot more information in it. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5911.46s)]
*  And the book helped, for me, kind of seal the deal on what I think was probably going [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5915.78s)]
*  on with Jim Jones at the time. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5919.86s)]
*  And it makes all the conspiracy stuff, yeah, it's kind of frightening in its own way, but [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5922.66s)]
*  this kind of makes the whole subsequent history of this story, in my opinion, darker and scarier [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5930.94s)]
*  than that. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5935.58s)]
*  So John Nash, the subject of A Beautiful Mind, he was 30 years old in 1959, teaching at MIT, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5938.5s)]
*  when he began receiving encoded messages from extraterrestrials warning him of an impending [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5945.68s)]
*  nuclear apocalypse that only he could stop. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5950.599999999999s)]
*  As I said, Jim Jones was 29 when he began receiving his alien messages in 1961. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5952.84s)]
*  Both Nash and Jim Jones were making contact with the world of geopolitics and nuclear [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5961.16s)]
*  war, albeit in very different ways. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5965.639999999999s)]
*  John Nash was in regular contact with famous scientists who'd worked on the Manhattan Project, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5968.12s)]
*  and he'd worked at the RAND Corporation designing game theoretical equations to predict outcomes [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5972.679999999999s)]
*  of various nuclear conflict scenarios. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5978.08s)]
*  He had a top secret clearance. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5980.16s)]
*  Jim Jones, again, he contacted that world from a different direction, but he was obsessing [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5983.64s)]
*  over global events through his interest in and early contact with the American communist [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5990.28s)]
*  movement going back to his college years during the McCarthy hearings. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5995.16s)]
*  I mentioned in an earlier episode, Jim had even had contact with law enforcement over [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=5999.2s)]
*  the issue, with G-Men pulling his mom out of her Richmond factory job to talk about [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6002.5599999999995s)]
*  her son's activities. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6006.88s)]
*  In some version, she was fired from that job over it, but I don't know if that's true or [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6007.88s)]
*  not. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6011.4400000000005s)]
*  In Nash's case, his job, the message he was getting from the extraterrestrials, his job [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6014.84s)]
*  was to warn governments of what was coming and then to design and implement a world government [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6021.12s)]
*  in order to prevent war between national states or between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6026.28s)]
*  Jim Jones didn't have the elite access that Nash did at the time, so his job was simply [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6031.68s)]
*  to take as many people, as many of his people as he could and get them out of harm's way. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6035.56s)]
*  As I said, both men were about the same age when they had their breakdown about a year [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6041.64s)]
*  and a half apart. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6045.88s)]
*  For Nash, there was no hiding what was going on. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6049.4800000000005s)]
*  Apparently he was oblivious to how this was going to be received, but he was wandering [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6053.92s)]
*  into other professors' classes at MIT while they were in session and he would start announcing [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6058.080000000001s)]
*  what the aliens had been telling him. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6063.8s)]
*  At first people thought he was just playing pranks, but it soon became apparent that there [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6066.0s)]
*  was something else going on. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6069.76s)]
*  When you're in an environment like that, with a bunch of serious people, engineers and scientists [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6071.16s)]
*  and math professors, and you start talking and behaving the way he was, you can imagine [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6076.8s)]
*  how people responded to him. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6082.68s)]
*  When no one took him seriously or they were afraid of him or got angry at his outburst, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6085.240000000001s)]
*  he began to question whether other people around him could even be trusted. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6092.64s)]
*  The messages started to inform him that they could not be trusted. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6096.72s)]
*  He starts to become more and more isolated from friends and family, more and more paranoid, [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6102.200000000001s)]
*  and his paranoia fed on the reactions that people had to him, which, I mean, you can't [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6106.68s)]
*  blame people for not having a good response to something like this. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6112.200000000001s)]
*  So Nash decides to take matters into his own hands. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6117.56s)]
*  He tries setting up appointments with ambassadors of foreign countries. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6120.08s)]
*  He made frequent trips to the UN building in New York and to Washington, D.C., leaving [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6124.0s)]
*  messages at embassies and writing letters to U.S. and foreign dignitaries. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6128.0s)]
*  At one point he's hospitalized against his will, which only confirmed for him that there [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6133.04s)]
*  was a larger conspiracy afoot to silence and persecute him, and so when he was released, [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6137.76s)]
*  he fled to Europe to claim asylum as a persecuted refugee of the United States. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6142.72s)]
*  Nash had enough money saved up to support himself for a while, and he visited several [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6148.16s)]
*  European countries trying to see foreign officials certain the whole time that he was on this [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6152.24s)]
*  important mission that would eventually bear fruit. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6157.0s)]
*  Eventually Nash came back and he got some treatment. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6162.24s)]
*  He was put on medication that helped a bit, but it slowed down his flowing mind to a trickle. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6165.4s)]
*  He would hang around Princeton just scribbling nonsense mathematical theorems in his notebook [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6170.8s)]
*  and smoking cigarettes. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6174.92s)]
*  Most students who were passing by this weird, quiet man, they were completely unaware that [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6176.68s)]
*  they were stepping over one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6182.360000000001s)]
*  Over the years his illness would flare up and simmer down and flare up again, and this [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6187.6s)]
*  was true even during the period that he'd been treated, before he'd been treated rather. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6192.52s)]
*  There were times when his friends and family thought everything was fine, and the fire [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6197.68s)]
*  was out and everything had passed, and maybe he was going to be normal again, and then [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6201.2s)]
*  he'd go off the rails. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6204.44s)]
*  It was the part about John Nash's European jaunt that really got my attention and made [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6205.919999999999s)]
*  me go back and reread the book. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6211.719999999999s)]
*  I need to move on from this part, but there's a lot of this episode left and we haven't [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6213.32s)]
*  even gotten into the wild stuff, but my best explanation for what Jones was up to during [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6218.599999999999s)]
*  his overseas odyssey is that he was chasing something similar to what John Nash was looking [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6222.639999999999s)]
*  for when he was in Europe. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6226.32s)]
*  Think about the story that we just told in that light. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6229.28s)]
*  Jim Jones in Cuba in early 1960. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6232.5599999999995s)]
*  He's supposed to have been over there recruiting 40 Cuban families to come live on communal [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6235.2s)]
*  farms in Indiana, but he didn't tell anyone back home that's what he was doing, and we [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6238.78s)]
*  know his church didn't have anywhere near the resources to do anything like that. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6243.16s)]
*  The man that he engaged for the purpose in Cuba was some rando nightclub singer he found [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6247.46s)]
*  at the Havana Hilton, and that guy later says that Jones was talking about paying him the [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6252.48s)]
*  equivalent of almost half a million dollars a year to help him set up communal farms across [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6256.2s)]
*  Central and South America. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6261.0s)]
*  The mainstream biographies give us nothing on this. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6264.24s)]
*  They give us nothing good, so I forgive the conspiracy theorist for thinking that maybe [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6266.28s)]
*  he was working for one of the intelligence agencies crawling around Cuba at the time [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6270.6s)]
*  trying to set up training camps similar to the ones that were being used to train fighters [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6274.2s)]
*  used in the Bay of Pigs invasion, but I think it makes more sense, or at least it's easier [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6279.24s)]
*  to come around to the idea, especially in light of where we know Jim Jones' mind is [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6285.12s)]
*  going to run off to in later years, to believe that he was just off on a quest that didn't [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6289.44s)]
*  have any better relationship to reality than the one that John Nash was on when he was [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6294.12s)]
*  leaving coded messages for foreign embassies in Washington or trying to set up meetings [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6298.28s)]
*  in European capitals. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6304.04s)]
*  Think about it, if we'd never known for certain that John Nash was mentally ill, say if he'd [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6307.32s)]
*  been hit by a bus sometime during his time in Europe, is there any doubt that there'd [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6311.639999999999s)]
*  be some conspiracy theorist today putting together the pieces from the letters he left [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6317.16s)]
*  behind and showing all this evidence that renowned mathematician John Nash recently [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6321.639999999999s)]
*  off working from the RAND Corporation and on military intelligence stuff at MIT that [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6329.639999999999s)]
*  he was trying to warn us of something? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6334.92s)]
*  Okay, what about Dan Mitriot? [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6337.24s)]
*  What about Jim's time in Brazil? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6340.36s)]
*  That has to be something, right? [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6341.72s)]
*  The fact that he shows up in the same city, one neighborhood over from where Mitriot lived, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6344.84s)]
*  and we know for certain that the two were acquainted with each other from their time [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6349.72s)]
*  in Richmond. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6353.24s)]
*  Okay, let's think about it. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6354.24s)]
*  Yes, they knew each other, that's a fact. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6356.4400000000005s)]
*  Jim said in his later years that he and his family had met with Mitriot's family on several [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6359.04s)]
*  occasions but that he never spent time with Mitriot himself in Brazil. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6364.76s)]
*  I can make sense of that. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6368.92s)]
*  Maybe Jim Jones did speak to Mitriot at some point, either before Mitriot left for Brazil [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6371.54s)]
*  or while they were down there, maybe not. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6375.299999999999s)]
*  Maybe Mitriot put something in his ear about how he's working for the government and if [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6378.139999999999s)]
*  Jim hears anything while he's down there doing his missionary work to let him know. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6381.42s)]
*  Maybe Jim Jones just took that a little bit too seriously. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6386.259999999999s)]
*  Or maybe he never did talk to Mitriot and Jim just gets the idea that he's playing [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6389.7s)]
*  secret agent and he's engaging with Mitriot's family in an attempt to get messages to Mitriot [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6393.46s)]
*  and to tell him the important information he thinks that he's gleaning from the street. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6400.54s)]
*  Jim's family made friends with another American missionary family down there and he would [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6406.1s)]
*  have their Portuguese speaking daughter translate newspapers and pamphlets for him. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6410.14s)]
*  He would read books and other materials about local guerrilla movements, he would read about [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6414.68s)]
*  their military equipment that was not just Brazil's but of the surrounding countries [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6418.98s)]
*  as well. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6423.42s)]
*  Maybe that's why Jim kept giving his neighbors different stories about what he was doing [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6424.82s)]
*  down there. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6427.9s)]
*  We know Jim never lifted a finger or accomplished anything at all toward figuring out a way [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6430.02s)]
*  to establish a ministry down there or to bring his followers from Indiana down. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6433.72s)]
*  Never did anything. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6438.46s)]
*  From all appearances, Jim Jones did a whole lot of nothing the entire time he was in Brazil. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6440.22s)]
*  Almost a two year period when his church back home, which he'd spent several years building [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6445.06s)]
*  into a successful enterprise, completely fell apart and shrank down to nothing but a few [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6449.02s)]
*  hardcore followers who were having trouble even keeping the lights on. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6453.9400000000005s)]
*  Maybe when Mitrione went back to the US for those two months, at the end of 1962, he asked [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6459.38s)]
*  his handlers to look into this guy who won't stop bothering me down in Brazil. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6464.5s)]
*  And maybe that's why the CIA ran a check on his passport and opened a file on him at the [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6468.8s)]
*  time. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6472.86s)]
*  And maybe that's why the CIA purged that file when Mitrione was killed in 1970, not because [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6474.14s)]
*  Mitrione was his handler, but because Mitrione was the one who'd asked for Jim to be looked [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6478.5s)]
*  into and that information became irrelevant once Mitrione was dead. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6483.1s)]
*  Now John Nash was a clinical schizophrenic and I read a lot of books about schizophrenia [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6489.26s)]
*  trying to figure out if I could put that label on Jim Jones. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6494.42s)]
*  And to be honest, I find it very difficult to do that. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6497.34s)]
*  There are a lot of reasons to say there's no way he could have been schizophrenic. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6501.7s)]
*  Although some of the people who knew him best, including arguably his closest follower, at [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6505.74s)]
*  least in the later stages, his long time personal lawyer who's still alive today, he studied [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6511.18s)]
*  this issue ever since and he thinks that Jim was a textbook paranoid schizophrenic. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6517.82s)]
*  I think the reason most psychologists who have looked at the information on Jim Jones [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6523.82s)]
*  from afar don't think he could have been a schizophrenic is that he was simply too functional [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6528.82s)]
*  for too long. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6533.3s)]
*  Schizophrenics cannot keep their shit together well enough to function in the world for decades [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6536.38s)]
*  the way he did. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6541.58s)]
*  But I think there's a bias built into the literature. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6544.259999999999s)]
*  Psychologists are studying schizophrenics who have been identified as such and admitted [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6547.78s)]
*  to institutions by definition. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6552.179999999999s)]
*  To be admitted to an institution, it means you're already running into trouble in the [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6555.94s)]
*  outside world, which happens to almost all schizophrenics very quickly once their symptoms [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6559.219999999999s)]
*  begin to manifest. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6564.26s)]
*  Think of Jim, rather John Nash, wandering into classrooms that are in session and talking [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6565.7s)]
*  about his alien messages. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6570.54s)]
*  Once the schizophrenic's behavior starts to encounter resistance, often in the form of [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6573.82s)]
*  fear or hostility from other people who don't understand what they're dealing with, that [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6578.82s)]
*  paranoia starts to spiral. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6583.3s)]
*  They become more and more isolated. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6585.9s)]
*  Their behavior becomes stranger and more detached from reality and there it goes. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6588.3s)]
*  But what if that doesn't happen? [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6595.3s)]
*  What if none of that happens? [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6597.42s)]
*  There's not a lot of literature about that. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6600.179999999999s)]
*  There are some scholars who have studied shamanism in traditional societies and who have suggested [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6603.3s)]
*  that shamans exhibit signs of schizophrenia. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6608.78s)]
*  In most of these societies shamans come from certain genetic lines and schizophrenia is [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6612.46s)]
*  inherited that way. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6617.7s)]
*  In most cases potential shamans are identified sometime around puberty or early adulthood [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6619.9800000000005s)]
*  when they have what looks like a psychotic break and schizophrenia tends to begin manifesting [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6625.54s)]
*  during puberty or early adulthood. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6630.34s)]
*  Except in these societies their symptoms are not medicalized. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6633.7s)]
*  Rather than being told that there's something wrong with them and that the voices they're [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6638.74s)]
*  hearing or the visions that they're having are just illusions, a sickness that needs [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6641.62s)]
*  to be cured somehow, discarded and hopefully overcome, they're told that they have a gift. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6646.26s)]
*  They're taken away by older shamans who have already been through this whole process and [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6652.1s)]
*  they're taught to navigate this new world that's beginning to erupt out of their unconscious. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6657.58s)]
*  What happens if rather than pathologizing schizophrenic symptoms we had a whole mythology [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6664.26s)]
*  and set of social institutions in place into which someone who began to manifest them was [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6670.34s)]
*  initiated so that as soon as the symptoms began to show the person was not confused, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6675.46s)]
*  they weren't afraid, they already had some idea of what was happening. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6681.9s)]
*  They trusted the teachers who were there to help them navigate it. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6686.34s)]
*  The answer is we don't really know what would happen because that's just not how we encounter [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6689.22s)]
*  psychosis. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6692.9800000000005s)]
*  We encounter it in a medical environment after it's already slammed into the uncomprehending [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6695.3s)]
*  hostility of the social world and the person's life has already begun to fall apart. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6700.82s)]
*  Jim Jones was not a shaman but he was in a very, very, very different situation than [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6708.1s)]
*  John Nash when his symptoms took over at MIT. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6713.26s)]
*  What happens if you start to get visions, prophecies of an impending apocalypse and [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6718.38s)]
*  you tell the people around you about them and that they must follow you in order to [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6723.54s)]
*  be saved and instead of calling the cops or an ambulance they say, you know, totally, [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6727.42s)]
*  I'm in, let's do it. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6732.46s)]
*  What happens if instead of meeting resistance in your social world your delusions are reinforced [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6735.9800000000005s)]
*  at every turn by everyone around you? [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6740.98s)]
*  And I don't mean like five people, I mean hundreds of people, thousands of people eventually. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6745.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, Jim Jones as time goes on he creates a self-contained little world where literally [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6749.7s)]
*  no one questions him or tells him no about anything ever. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6755.0199999999995s)]
*  Anything he says is true and if people don't believe it they keep their mouths shut about [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6761.0199999999995s)]
*  it. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6766.66s)]
*  So what happens if you put a delusional schizophrenic or I don't know, maybe someone suffering from [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6768.38s)]
*  some form of non-schizophrenic psychosis. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6773.04s)]
*  The schizophrenic diagnosis is so broad. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6776.02s)]
*  What happens if you put someone like that in this situation where they just encounter [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6778.92s)]
*  no resistance, nothing but reinforcement and encouragement from everybody around them? [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6783.3s)]
*  Maybe Jim Jones is what happens. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6790.5s)]
*  Whenever he does encounter resistance of any kind over the years his paranoia spirals out [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6793.98s)]
*  of control and his behavior becomes extremely hostile and aggressive. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6799.679999999999s)]
*  Mostly that doesn't happen because mostly he lives within his little self-contained [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6805.099999999999s)]
*  world but in later years when his profile rises to the point where he starts entering [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6809.54s)]
*  into the Bay Area political arena and he starts attracting the attention of the press, when [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6813.92s)]
*  some disgruntled former members form a coalition to try to break apart people's temple, when [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6819.5s)]
*  that starts to happen it takes no time at all for his mind to just completely fall apart [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6824.38s)]
*  and for him to start behaving exactly the way we're used to paranoid schizophrenics [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6830.26s)]
*  doing. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6834.1s)]
*  When he first starts getting these visions in 61 he doesn't share them with very many [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6837.18s)]
*  people at all. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6840.54s)]
*  In fact he creates fake incidents to explain his breakdown and odd behavior. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6841.54s)]
*  So the stress that he's feeling because he clearly is not, I'm talking about getting [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6846.1s)]
*  all this automatic reinforcement, he's still kind of withholding a lot of this and not [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6852.18s)]
*  telling a lot of people so he's still clearly kind of worried about it and doesn't know [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6856.54s)]
*  what to do and the stress does finally take him down. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6859.900000000001s)]
*  And he makes up an excuse about looking for a safe refuge and bails out. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6864.22s)]
*  Maybe again. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6868.900000000001s)]
*  But his hardcore followers, his people, they take the prophecies of war and Armageddon [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6869.900000000001s)]
*  seriously and by late 1963 after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Kennedy assassinations, [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6874.98s)]
*  assassination rather, and the civil rights movement is becoming more deadly, those core [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6881.94s)]
*  followers, his family, they're begging him please, please, please come back. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6887.0599999999995s)]
*  The world was catching on fire and they needed him because only he could save them and so [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6893.419999999999s)]
*  after two years he leaves Brazil and comes back to his people to save them. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6898.379999999999s)]
*  Maybe that's what happened. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6904.94s)]
*  So Jim Jones gets back to Indiana and he's ready to roll. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6908.7s)]
*  Jim Jones has this thing about him, something I'll mention again, it's something that would [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6913.54s)]
*  always be one of his defining characteristics. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6919.62s)]
*  When he's backed into a corner he comes out swinging. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6921.74s)]
*  You see it here after he returns from Brazil and you'll see it a few more times when he's [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6926.0599999999995s)]
*  pushed into a place where often by his own making it looks like it might just be time [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6930.02s)]
*  to pack it up. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6937.540000000001s)]
*  Never again does he try to slip away or back down after he gets back from Brazil. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6940.900000000001s)]
*  His response from now on will be to just take things up to another level from anything you've [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6947.14s)]
*  really seen out of him before. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6951.780000000001s)]
*  So he's on a mission when he gets back. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6954.900000000001s)]
*  But again he's starting basically from scratch. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6957.34s)]
*  By the time he's settled, we're into 1964 now, and his church, this big, big building [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6960.0199999999995s)]
*  that he has, the old synagogue he bought in 56 that holds seven, eight hundred people, [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6966.38s)]
*  no problem, is empty. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6970.46s)]
*  People have moved on. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6972.98s)]
*  He's got maybe a hundred people waiting for him when he gets back and he's preaching to [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6974.62s)]
*  them in this big empty church. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6978.0199999999995s)]
*  The first thing he does is reassert control. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6981.38s)]
*  He left the church under management of a few of his assistant pastors, each of whom were [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6984.5s)]
*  more conventional, you know, by the book American Christians, and he was. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6989.58s)]
*  His social goals and politics weren't their focus. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6994.3s)]
*  They were about what you'd expect to see in a normal Midwestern church. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6996.38s)]
*  You know, pray to Jesus, accept him as your Lord and Savior, have faith and hope because [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=6999.26s)]
*  he died for our sins and so on. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7003.74s)]
*  Jim actually preferred things that way while he was gone because it meant that none of [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7006.62s)]
*  them were going to be in any position to usurp his position with the people who were around [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7009.66s)]
*  for the social gospel, which those are really the people that he cared about keeping around. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7014.1s)]
*  They didn't do the healing or the hocus pocus calling out people's social security numbers [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7019.620000000001s)]
*  or diagnosing their sicknesses from the pulpit. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7023.740000000001s)]
*  It just become a church. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7026.18s)]
*  Almost all the people who were left in people's temple by this point were white. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7028.9800000000005s)]
*  The black folks, they'd been there for Jim Jones. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7033.1s)]
*  They could hear the gospel preach in their old black churches with their families and [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7036.54s)]
*  neighbors. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7040.42s)]
*  What remained now was a hard core of white socially conscious integrationists who really [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7041.66s)]
*  bought into the idea that there was something special and unique about the man Jim Jones. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7047.18s)]
*  So he faced no obstacles to reestablishing himself as the head of the church, but you [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7053.46s)]
*  know, it had been a long time and he felt threatened by the more traditional assistant [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7057.26s)]
*  pastors who'd been guiding things during his absence. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7061.58s)]
*  So in short order, he pushed them out, made it clear that they weren't welcome and got [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7063.82s)]
*  them out of the way altogether. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7068.86s)]
*  At least Jim had a plan. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7071.06s)]
*  Not everyone was going to go along with it. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7073.38s)]
*  He didn't need the other leaders who weren't a challenge to his overall leadership, but [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7074.820000000001s)]
*  they had accrued some authority and credibility within the church. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7079.700000000001s)]
*  He didn't want them around to raise objections. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7082.620000000001s)]
*  He was leaving Indiana and he wanted his people to come with him. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7085.900000000001s)]
*  Things had changed in Indiana and Indianapolis at least in the two years that he'd been gone. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7090.54s)]
*  The city government had made reforms that brought black ministers and other black leaders [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7094.700000000001s)]
*  and given them a real voice in the local government. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7099.5s)]
*  Black people in Indianapolis had flocked to Jim Jones as a guy who could get things done [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7103.42s)]
*  for them when he was establishing himself in the fifties, but now they had options from [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7106.9800000000005s)]
*  within their own communities. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7111.22s)]
*  While the freedom summer heated up in 1964, Indy was a place of relative calm. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7114.34s)]
*  Far from perfect, but not a particularly green pasture for a rabble rousing integrationist [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7120.9400000000005s)]
*  preacher. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7126.900000000001s)]
*  You go throughout the years as the whole country starts to catch on fire with racial violence [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7128.9s)]
*  and stuff and Indianapolis never figures too prominently. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7133.62s)]
*  Jim no longer had his position as director of the Human Rights Commission and the clout [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7139.0599999999995s)]
*  that he'd spent years building up in the city was pretty much gone. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7142.86s)]
*  Upon his return, he'd been able to get back the weekly radio spot that he'd had before [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7147.219999999999s)]
*  he left, but he lost that within a few months. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7150.94s)]
*  Previously, he'd been careful. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7153.9s)]
*  Before he left for South America, he'd been pretty careful to use that public-facing platform [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7156.62s)]
*  to put on a show of Christian conventionality with a social message sprinkled in, but now [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7161.0199999999995s)]
*  he turned it into a weekly sociopolitical rant. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7165.9s)]
*  Often criticizing the Bible and other churches for hypocrisy on issues of social and racial [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7169.74s)]
*  justice very aggressively, he also ramped up his self-aggrandizing rhetoric, which had [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7174.18s)]
*  begun to alienate some of his remaining traditional-minded advisors and also some other preachers and [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7179.9s)]
*  other leaders in the Indianapolis Christian community as well. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7187.18s)]
*  He would speak of himself as a modern-day apostle openly. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7189.94s)]
*  He wasn't shy about that anymore. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7194.0599999999995s)]
*  He wasn't just inside the church now. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7196.26s)]
*  One brochure that they put out read, I am causing untold thousands to believe in the [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7198.34s)]
*  Jesus of ancient history by the great miracles and healings, prophecies and discernment I [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7202.98s)]
*  perform in his name. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7207.66s)]
*  That's the kind of stuff that, again, he would say, but he would keep it in house before [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7210.1s)]
*  he left, but those filters were off. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7215.3s)]
*  After his radio show was canceled, he began to complain that other ministers around town [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7218.58s)]
*  had had it in for him, and that's why it was canceled. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7223.46s)]
*  He believed they were spreading rumors that he was insane and that his absence had been [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7225.54s)]
*  due to a stay in a lunatic asylum. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7229.9800000000005s)]
*  He told his advisors that he thought the IRS and FBI were investigating him, although there's [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7233.46s)]
*  no evidence that that was true at this point. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7237.26s)]
*  So it was time to look elsewhere. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7240.26s)]
*  It was time to leave Indianapolis. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7241.26s)]
*  Now, if Jim Jones was looking just for a fresh start, there were lots of places that were [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7243.98s)]
*  not far away that he could have done just fine. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7248.94s)]
*  He had connections in Chicago, for example, going back quite a ways, and with race relations [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7251.78s)]
*  coming to a boil in that city, it would have been a pretty prime location for a young, [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7256.7s)]
*  charismatic, social activist preacher like him to rebuild his movement. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7261.379999999999s)]
*  But it wasn't just about a fresh start. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7266.179999999999s)]
*  Chicago wasn't going to do, because Jim Jones was sincere in his terror over nuclear war. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7267.74s)]
*  And he wanted to find someplace safe. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7273.9400000000005s)]
*  That old Esquire magazine article does come into play in this point. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7277.02s)]
*  It might have pointed him to Belo Horizonte, Brazil. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7281.34s)]
*  It had mentioned one place in the United States, in the whole country, as the safest one in [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7284.26s)]
*  America. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7289.820000000001s)]
*  The safest place in the United States is Eureka, California, a landlocked port of nearly 30,000 [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7291.820000000001s)]
*  people 283 miles north of San Francisco and more than 100 miles north of the nearest target. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7298.219999999999s)]
*  It is west of the Sierras and upwind from every target in the United States. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7304.219999999999s)]
*  By the end of 1964, Jim Jones is making scouting trips to Northern California, and by early [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7310.419999999999s)]
*  1965 he had settled on Ukiah, an inland town in Mendocino County. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7315.82s)]
*  That would be the place that he would take his people to find refuge. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7321.459999999999s)]
*  In July 1965, after school in Indianapolis had let out, and to the shocked dismay and [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7325.94s)]

*  and trucks, and as so many wanderers, utopians, and outcasts before them set out in a long [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7337.62s)]
*  train into the American West. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7344.2s)]
*  Those early days in California were good times for this group of people that by this point [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7348.46s)]
*  had really become a big extended family. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7354.1s)]
*  Those who had homes and property had sold them in Indianapolis, and they all pooled [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7358.660000000001s)]
*  their resources into a church fund to take care of everybody while they all found jobs [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7362.780000000001s)]
*  and places to live in California. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7366.9400000000005s)]
*  These people were really close to one another, and we live in such a disconnected society, [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7370.06s)]
*  I think it can be hard to understand that, but on the other hand, I think that the fact [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7375.740000000001s)]
*  that we do live in such a disconnected society kind of makes it easier to understand. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7380.3s)]
*  It's the key to understanding why when they found this environment, this group of people, [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7384.7s)]
*  why it seemed so significant to them. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7390.900000000001s)]
*  We're throwing everything else away to try to make something out of it, and Jim Jones [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7394.14s)]
*  was at the center of it. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7399.02s)]
*  He made it happen, and that inspired just an incredible amount of personal loyalty in [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7400.42s)]
*  this bunch of people. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7405.42s)]
*  Jack Beam was an Indiana member who had left his church in Indiana to join up with Jim [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7407.86s)]
*  a few years back, and Jack was typical, fiercely loyal to Jim Jones all the way to the very [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7414.3s)]
*  end. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7420.74s)]
*  When he met Jim Jones, Jim still had this little nothing church operating out of a storefront, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7421.74s)]
*  and he'd been invited to do a few guest sermons at this big, popular Pentecostal church with [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7428.74s)]
*  a beautiful church building that was looking for someone to replace their pastor who was [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7433.54s)]
*  coming up on retirement, and this is where Jack Beam went to church, and Jack remembers [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7437.9s)]
*  how the whole thing happened. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7442.94s)]
*  You get the point. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7463.9800000000005s)]
*  All Jim did was heal about three people that Sunday, and I mean, the word went out like [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7466.26s)]
*  wildfire. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7470.66s)]
*  The next Sunday afternoon, you couldn't even get in that place. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7471.66s)]
*  It was packed out, and people in the parking lot looking in the doors. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7474.82s)]
*  Well, about the third time that Jim had come there, some black people had come, and they'd [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7478.82s)]
*  been crammed way in the back row, and some didn't even get in. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7484.18s)]
*  So Jim tells his wife Marceline, he said, by God, I want them up here on the platform [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7488.34s)]
*  with me. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7492.44s)]
*  And by God, Marceline brought them right up there. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7493.44s)]
*  Well, shit, after the service, we had a board meeting, and they told Jim, or we did, because [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7497.04s)]
*  I was on the board, we told him, don't be bringing niggers on the front. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7502.599999999999s)]
*  I'll tell you what we'll do. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7507.719999999999s)]
*  We'll build a church for the niggers, and you can minister to them, and then you can [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7509.5599999999995s)]
*  come minister to the white people. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7513.04s)]
*  I was still a racist back then. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7515.5599999999995s)]
*  A lot of people had this problem. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7517.24s)]
*  They wanted the healings, but they were tore up on the race issue. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7519.599999999999s)]
*  Now, Laurel Street Tabernacle wasn't no goddamn shabby house on the hill. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7523.84s)]
*  This was a brand new church, and everything in it was brand new, and Jim was going to [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7528.8s)]
*  be the pastor. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7532.16s)]
*  He stood up and said to us, the most segregated institution in the United States is the church [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7534.04s)]
*  at 11 o'clock on Sunday morning, and I'll have no part of that. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7539.8s)]
*  And he walked out of that goddamn thing. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7544.08s)]
*  I said, there's a guy with balls, man. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7547.8s)]
*  He's walking out. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7549.76s)]
*  My wife said, I like them. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7551.8s)]
*  They're a nice young couple. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7553.4400000000005s)]
*  And I said, I do too. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7554.4400000000005s)]
*  So we went with him. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7556.4400000000005s)]
*  He was preaching scorching sermons. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7558.72s)]
*  Jim could out-preach anyone at that time, and it would electrify people. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7560.72s)]
*  Out of one blood, God made all nations to rule on the face of the earth, the whole racial [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7565.16s)]
*  thing from a biblical standpoint. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7569.32s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7571.04s)]
*  But he wanted to say, but they was religious people. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7572.6s)]
*  You want the fucking healing? [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7576.68s)]
*  Well, stick your money up your fucking ass if you don't love these black people, end [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7578.400000000001s)]
*  quote. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7582.360000000001s)]
*  And from that day on, Jack Beam was loyal to Jim Jones. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7583.360000000001s)]
*  He loved Jim Jones. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7587.68s)]
*  He loved the man. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7589.68s)]
*  He loved his family for that, and he stuck with them, again, like I said, at the very [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7593.76s)]
*  end. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7597.68s)]
*  He was typical, a lot of these Indiana members. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7598.68s)]
*  There are about 100 of them that rolled into Ukiah that summer of 65. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7603.36s)]
*  And Ukiah was a small town, so their arrival was noticed. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7607.4s)]
*  Almost all of these new arrivals are white, but the few black members who came along, [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7612.4s)]
*  they learned very quickly that California came in different flavors. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7616.32s)]
*  This part of Cali is still Trump country to this day. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7621.639999999999s)]
*  And in 1965, it was a whole different planet from LA and San Francisco stereotypes that [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7624.44s)]
*  most people have about the state. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7630.08s)]
*  Jim and his family lived humbly. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7633.16s)]
*  They worked hard. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7635.48s)]
*  His wife, Marceline, found a job as a social worker at Mendocino State Hospital. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7637.04s)]
*  And Jim, just like he'd done back in Indianapolis, lined up several gigs, working all the time [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7641.64s)]
*  as a school teacher, for example, in and around Ukiah. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7646.76s)]
*  It wasn't much, but they made ends meet. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7650.88s)]
*  Jim taught American history and government at an adult school in town, which is just [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7653.64s)]
*  great considering what we know about him later. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7660.240000000001s)]
*  And both of those classes that he was teaching, they were among the most popular at the school. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7663.160000000001s)]
*  Several of his students were actually adult members of People's Temple who were finishing [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7669.160000000001s)]
*  their high school diploma at Jim's insistence. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7672.280000000001s)]
*  The popularity of his classes persuaded the school to overlook complaints from some of [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7676.320000000001s)]
*  the students about their controversial content. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7680.320000000001s)]
*  He'd often use the platform to go on rants against the US government and make dire predictions [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7683.200000000001s)]
*  about war and environmental destruction and overpopulation. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7687.76s)]
*  It was the 60s, and hearing a teacher or professor rant about that stuff was getting a little [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7690.92s)]
*  more common. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7696.320000000001s)]
*  So they let it go. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7697.820000000001s)]
*  But he once told a class at the Catholic Church opposed abortion only because they wanted [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7698.820000000001s)]
*  to populate the world with more Catholics in order to further the church's quest to [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7703.360000000001s)]
*  rule the world. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7708.0s)]
*  That one got a complaint. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7709.0s)]
*  He advocated masturbation as a substitute for sex one time, and he even regaled the [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7712.0s)]
*  class by describing his own technique to them. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7716.8s)]
*  It wasn't just Jim's strange behavior, his paranoia followed him to California too. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7719.36s)]
*  Of course you don't just go from thinking extraterrestrials are sending you prophecies [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7724.28s)]
*  about impending nuclear armageddon and then just wake up the next day all better with [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7729.4s)]
*  no treatment or medication or anything at all, especially when you're surrounded by [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7734.6s)]
*  people who don't check you on any of that. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7738.72s)]
*  They just eat it up and reinforce it. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7741.32s)]
*  So that follows him out there. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7744.36s)]
*  In his adult school class that he was teaching, his American history and government classes, [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7746.639999999999s)]
*  he wanted to begin to obliquely start advocating for socialism to feel people out. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7752.5199999999995s)]
*  So when he did that, he was certain that the school administration was going to be spying [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7757.5599999999995s)]
*  on him. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7761.04s)]
*  So he closes and locks all the windows, and the students are complaining because it's [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7762.04s)]
*  100 degrees there in the summer and they're all hot and sweaty. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7766.28s)]
*  He even assigned some of his church members to stand guard outside the classroom door [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7769.56s)]
*  to make sure nobody was listening in. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7774.120000000001s)]
*  Once he felt safe, he started laying into these Marxist-inspired diatribes against capitalism [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7777.120000000001s)]
*  and American imperialism. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7782.72s)]
*  He even used his position in that class to start recruiting students into People's Temple. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7784.88s)]
*  That was one of the early techniques that he used. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7788.68s)]
*  The first non-Indiana person, the first person to join People's Temple in California, he [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7792.240000000001s)]
*  remembered Jim's paranoia even in those early days. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7798.72s)]
*  He said, Jim would become paranoid. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7802.52s)]
*  I didn't know how to evaluate that, and I still don't know how to evaluate that. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7804.8s)]
*  I was appointed to an ad hoc committee to serve as advisors to him in the fall of 67. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7809.52s)]
*  The first thing that Jim had us do was check the floor, the walls, the furniture for hidden [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7813.4400000000005s)]
*  microphones because he was afraid that the place had been bugged and it was not safe. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7817.96s)]
*  I was very dubious at the time. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7823.320000000001s)]
*  I thought, who would bug this place? [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7824.84s)]
*  He gathered us together and shared that we were, as a group, increasingly under suspicion [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7827.88s)]
*  by the government and the corporate elite that ran the government. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7832.64s)]
*  He was afraid that we were not going to be able to develop in terms of our vision in [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7836.6s)]
*  the United States and that we needed to begin plans, contingency plans, for going elsewhere. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7840.0s)]
*  And so we began planning for a possible move to the Soviet Union. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7845.8s)]
*  This was in 1967, a little over a year after they had been settled in California. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7849.92s)]
*  This temple at this point has got barely over a hundred members. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7856.96s)]
*  They're just a little group of nondescript people up in a small northern California town. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7861.76s)]
*  It's extremely delusional, obviously, and signs of something bigger going on in Jim [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7869.4800000000005s)]
*  Jones' mind that he thinks the corporate elite that runs the government is going to be interested [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7874.66s)]
*  in what they're doing. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7878.92s)]
*  Soon after they got up there, Jim reaches out to this interesting little communal Christian [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7882.52s)]
*  group in the area called the Church of the Golden Rule and creates a relationship with [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7886.36s)]
*  them. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7890.44s)]
*  The Golden Rule people lived together and held services on 16,000 acres of really nice [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7891.44s)]
*  land up there bequeathed to them in earlier, better times. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7897.5s)]
*  When People's Temple came upon them, Golden Rule only had about 200 members, but they [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7902.5599999999995s)]
*  were quite larger back in the day. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7907.24s)]
*  They ran a farm and a dairy. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7909.5599999999995s)]
*  They attended church services every morning and they lived kind of quiet lives, mostly [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7911.36s)]
*  out of sight and out of mind of the surrounding towns. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7917.36s)]
*  People's Temple was welcomed and well received by Golden Rule, who allowed Jim to use their [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7920.839999999999s)]
*  schoolhouse to conduct temple services until he could find a place of their own. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7925.0599999999995s)]
*  The two churches' children would play together and swim together and they'd go on little [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7930.599999999999s)]
*  and the groups would often share communal meals with one another. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7936.68s)]
*  Very soon the relationship went sour. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7942.68s)]
*  Jim just couldn't help himself. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7944.4800000000005s)]
*  He and his people started plotting and began to systematically trying to recruit away Golden [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7946.4400000000005s)]
*  Rule members who were sensitive to his racial justice message. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7950.84s)]
*  He saw this big plot of land that they had and this whole thing and there were so few [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7956.4800000000005s)]
*  members and it was still kind of dwindling and falling apart. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7959.8s)]
*  He thought maybe they could merge the two churches and then he could take over the combined [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7962.32s)]
*  movement at some point himself. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7966.88s)]
*  And soon it was clear to Golden Rule that he had some aggressive plans and one day he [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7969.759999999999s)]
*  stood up in one of the services and he suggested that the two churches merge with one another [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7975.48s)]
*  and the Golden Rule elders by that point kind of saw what was going on so they voted down [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7979.92s)]
*  the merger and told People's Temple they had to move on. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7984.04s)]
*  So for a while Jim was conducting services in the large front yard of one of the member [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7988.08s)]
*  families. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7996.5599999999995s)]
*  When it rained his people would gather in Jim's garage sitting tight as sardines on [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=7998.12s)]
*  the concrete floor singing songs and clapping and listening to Jim as he preached and prophesied. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8003.4s)]
*  It's quite a vision. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8011.08s)]
*  These people are driving by and these people are just gathered in the front yard or in [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8012.08s)]
*  some dude's garage and they're just you know they're into it. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8016.24s)]
*  They're singing and clapping. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8020.8s)]
*  I mean they're getting down like this is real to them. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8021.8s)]
*  I know it's all very strange but in this early period I honestly find something really endearing [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8025.4s)]
*  and kind of romantic about it. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8032.0s)]
*  You know these were people who had had lives in Indianapolis. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8035.16s)]
*  They didn't head to California out of desperation. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8039.0s)]
*  They really had come to think of each other as a big family. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8042.88s)]
*  They loved each other and they wanted to live their lives together. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8045.92s)]
*  Not just together like you know hey this is my buddy every once in a while after work [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8051.88s)]
*  we get together to watch a game or have a beer. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8056.08s)]
*  They wanted to be together you know really together. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8059.32s)]
*  They wanted back that thing that we gave up when we stopped living as tribes and took [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8063.72s)]
*  up wage work in the towns and cities of urban civilization. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8068.6s)]
*  They wanted it back. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8072.04s)]
*  These were not wealthy people or people with any special skills far from it. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8074.52s)]
*  Some of the most important figures in the church Jim's closest aides were in those classes [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8080.68s)]
*  just now finishing their high school education. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8085.320000000001s)]
*  But you know they were out there they were going to make a go of it. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8089.080000000001s)]
*  Writer men who usually like most of the writers on this topic he takes a pretty cynical or [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8093.320000000001s)]
*  at least skeptical view of everything as if everything from the very beginning is all [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8100.16s)]
*  some big trap that Jim Jones is laying for people. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8105.24s)]
*  Even he leaves that off when he writes about this period. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8108.76s)]
*  Quote the temple had become an extended family for those who had traveled west. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8111.72s)]
*  At last Jones had penetrated the barrier of blood relationships and brought a sizable [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8117.599999999999s)]
*  number through it. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8122.44s)]
*  As father to them all a living standard of love Jones made the rounds to their homes [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8124.88s)]
*  in the hills and hollows chatting enjoying their company listening showing concern for [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8129.18s)]
*  their well-being and understanding for their problems as a friend and counselor. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8134.62s)]
*  He listened as no man could listen with dark eyes mirroring understanding empathy and love [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8139.9800000000005s)]
*  without sounding preachy. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8146.42s)]
*  He talked about the need to help and love one another. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8148.02s)]
*  He would break up a fight between two children then sit down on the ground with them for [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8151.26s)]
*  hours to convey the message. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8155.12s)]
*  No problem or concern was too small to bring to his attention. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8157.82s)]
*  He took on a remarkable burden of caring while demanding little in return. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8161.58s)]
*  Only with apology in his voice would he ask members to do things for their church. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8166.62s)]
*  People did not mind helping someone work on his car or harvest grapes or dig a septic [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8171.759999999999s)]
*  tank. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8176.58s)]

*  No one in the bathroom says anything. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8368.38s)]
*  I get on the bus and I'm singing it. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8370.5s)]
*  Everybody in the whole bus is singing it with me to the Mickey Mouse tune. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8373.36s)]
*  N-I-G-G-E-R nigger. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8376.46s)]
*  The bus driver says, Mr. Jones should you be saying that word? [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8380.62s)]
*  I say it ain't four letters. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8384.74s)]
*  I walk in the house. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8387.380000000001s)]
*  N-I-G-G-E-R nigger. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8389.300000000001s)]
*  Bam! [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8391.300000000001s)]
*  Jim hits me. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8392.460000000001s)]
*  What did you say? [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8393.980000000001s)]
*  I jump up. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8394.980000000001s)]
*  Nigger! [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8396.66s)]
*  Bam! [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8397.66s)]
*  What did you say? [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8398.66s)]
*  Nigger! [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8399.66s)]
*  Bam! [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8400.66s)]
*  Fourth time I'm a little slow but finally starting to get it. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8401.66s)]
*  I'm standing up slower. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8405.900000000001s)]
*  What did you say? [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8408.060000000001s)]
*  The word that I saw on the bathroom wall, he says, you know what that word means? [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8410.06s)]
*  No. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8416.14s)]
*  He puts on his jacket. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8417.14s)]
*  We go to the school. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8419.859999999999s)]
*  He makes me show it to him. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8421.06s)]
*  We go down to the principal's office. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8423.3s)]
*  Jim reads him the riot act. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8424.939999999999s)]
*  I have no idea why he's mad. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8426.859999999999s)]
*  Then he takes me home and he explains to me what nigger means. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8429.34s)]
*  He said nigger is a word they use against negro people. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8433.58s)]
*  Black people, derogatory, to put them down. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8437.3s)]
*  It means black heart and it was used in slavery. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8440.46s)]
*  Slavery? [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8443.259999999998s)]
*  What was that? [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8444.259999999998s)]
*  I'm serious. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8446.14s)]
*  He goes, well, you're a negro. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8447.699999999999s)]
*  I'm what? [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8450.179999999998s)]
*  And thus Jim Jones brought me into his life and gave me that education. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8452.259999999998s)]
*  One time when some temple members were swimming at a nearby lake, a few locals shouted nigger [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8459.3s)]
*  lover at them. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8466.98s)]
*  What do you think Jim Jones did? [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8467.98s)]
*  He went home and tore out all the grape vines in front of his house and pulled some money [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8471.26s)]
*  out of the temple fund and borrowed a tractor and tools and got his people together to dig [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8476.9s)]
*  out and construct a big community pool for everyone. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8481.5s)]
*  Once that was done, the solution to the problem of finding a church seemed pretty straightforward. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8485.62s)]
*  They could build a pool, they could build a church, so that's what they did. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8490.22s)]
*  They built it right over the swimming pool actually, so it turned it into an indoor pool. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8494.5s)]
*  They installed a large kitchen in the building where they could cook up large meals to share [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8499.859999999999s)]
*  together. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8503.82s)]
*  And they left a lot of extra room in the church besides what they needed for themselves because [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8504.82s)]
*  Jim had plans. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8508.82s)]
*  He wanted to grow. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8509.82s)]
*  They even got a kind of a cute little plastic stained glass window custom made with a People's [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8512.06s)]
*  Temple logo, which was a sunburst and a dove of peace. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8517.66s)]
*  They put it up on the wall so that it was right over the pulpit on one side and on the [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8521.22s)]
*  other side of the wall it was over the pool. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8526.099999999999s)]
*  Again, it was much bigger than they needed because Jim Jones had plans to fill it up. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8528.619999999999s)]
*  When the people went to church services, when they would share meals cooked in the kitchen [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8535.179999999998s)]
*  that they'd built, when they watched their children swim and play in the pool that they [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8539.74s)]
*  dug out, they felt a tremendous sense of pride and they'd earned that. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8544.08s)]
*  They felt a lot of love and appreciation for each other and they earned that too. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8549.74s)]
*  You almost wonder what would have happened to People's Temple if they had stayed in Indiana [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8555.82s)]
*  or if they had done like Golden Rule and moved up to Montana or North Dakota, found some [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8564.3s)]
*  quiet patch of land and built a nice little rural Eden for themselves. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8570.22s)]
*  But then again, maybe it had to fall apart. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8576.06s)]
*  Maybe all the good and the bad were, you could kind of trace them back to the same tendencies. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8579.42s)]
*  Maybe the time bombs in their ideology and in Jim Jones' personality were going to have [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8585.18s)]
*  to go off at some point no matter where they were. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8589.58s)]
*  It seems like the story of every disaster starts off with everything was going so well [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8592.72s)]
*  and then in any case, they hadn't stayed in Indiana and they hadn't gone off into the [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8597.58s)]
*  mountains or to a farm in Montana. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8603.58s)]
*  They'd gone to California in the orbit of the Bay Area no less. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8606.12s)]
*  They had gone right into the heart of the craziest place they could have gone at the [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8611.240000000002s)]
*  craziest time that they could have possibly chosen to go there. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8615.84s)]
*  Jim and his people hadn't been the first misfits to pack up their wagons and head west. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8621.160000000002s)]
*  All those people who had to keep moving, keep moving west, finding each potential stop along [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8625.84s)]
*  the way just a little too stifling and people around them just not quite as welcoming as [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8632.08s)]
*  they'd hoped. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8638.0s)]
*  They barreled over the horizon, over mountains and over deserts toward the orange haze of [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8639.44s)]
*  the setting sun until they all piled up on top of each other running headlong into the [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8643.92s)]
*  final barrier of the Pacific Ocean and that's California. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8648.84s)]
*  California was more wide open in a way that most of the older settled parts of the country [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8654.56s)]
*  were not anymore. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8660.039999999999s)]
*  When it came to the 60s black power and other radical movements, you know, maybe New York [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8661.68s)]
*  was more militant but no place was wilder than Cali. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8665.84s)]
*  In the Bay Area, you know, Berkeley, San Francisco, it was like a beacon drawing in all the people [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8670.76s)]
*  from around the country who were sure that they were going to find some unidentifiable [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8676.68s)]
*  thing that they hadn't been able to turn up anywhere else that they'd looked. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8681.720000000001s)]
*  And of all times for someone like Jim Jones to show up. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8686.080000000002s)]
*  Jim and his merry band drove into Ukiah in July of 1965. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8690.56s)]
*  They hadn't even finished unpacking when the Watts riots erupted just a half days drive [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8697.08s)]
*  down Highway 101 in Los Angeles. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8702.759999999998s)]
*  This was the year that the U.S. got fully committed in Vietnam. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8706.599999999999s)]
*  The people spent the fall and winter of that first year finding homes and jobs in and around [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8711.0s)]
*  Ukiah getting themselves settled and that first summer after they'd been settled, while [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8715.0s)]
*  they watched their kids play tag and swim in the new pool, Stokely Carmichael was announcing [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8719.76s)]
*  the birth of the black power movement and race riots were raging in cities around the [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8724.800000000001s)]
*  country and two young guys named Huey Newton and Bobby Seale were buying their first guns [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8728.52s)]
*  and pulling in their first recruits for the Black Panthers in nearby Oakland. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8734.16s)]
*  By 1967, 100,000 hippies were converging just that summer on San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8739.880000000001s)]
*  to drop acid and make love and rock out during the summer of love. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8746.68s)]
*  Jim would have turned on his TV set in 67 that May and seen California's new governor [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8751.359999999999s)]
*  Ronald Reagan standing outside the Capitol building in nearby Sacramento denouncing the [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8756.56s)]
*  swarm of armed Black Panthers that had just invaded the legislative chambers. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8762.039999999999s)]
*  And a few months later after devastating race riots in Newark and Detroit that saw the freaking [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8767.24s)]
*  82nd Airborne and the 101st called in to bail out the police and National Guard, Jim would [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8773.16s)]
*  turn on his TV again and see that same young Black Panther Huey Newton being led away in [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8779.0s)]
*  handcuffs after shooting a cop and taking a bullet in his own belly. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8783.24s)]
*  The number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam that year had increased to over half a million [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8787.36s)]
*  and thousands of young American men, including 25-year-old heavyweight champion Muhammad [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8794.039999999999s)]
*  Ali, were being arrested for refusing to go. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8798.6s)]
*  And this is just 1967. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8801.56s)]
*  Things haven't even gotten started yet. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8803.36s)]
*  So no, Jim and his people had not gone to Montana. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8806.88s)]
*  They had come to California. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8809.84s)]
*  And they hadn't come for a quiet life. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8812.36s)]
*  Soon after they were settled, Jim decided now was the time to announce their presence [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8814.4s)]
*  to the residents of their new conservative little town in case anyone had missed them [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8818.88s)]
*  moving in. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8824.64s)]
*  And so they drew up placards and stuck them on sticks and printed up flyers to pass out [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8826.48s)]
*  and went on a march through the downtown boulevard of Ukiah in protest against the Vietnam War. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8831.32s)]
*  It was intentionally confrontational and, as you can imagine, it was not well received. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8837.0s)]
*  No one threw rocks at them or anything, but the demonstration ensured that from the earliest [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8842.84s)]
*  days they'd be looked at a little sideways by this community that they'd just moved into. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8848.44s)]
*  And I mean, just this act, it sounds pretty basic, but just think about it. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8853.24s)]
*  It gives you an idea of the mentality that Jim and his people had and how they planned [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8858.12s)]
*  from the beginning on relating to the people around them. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8863.0s)]
*  I know it doesn't sound like much, and you could say, you know what, those rednecks in Ukiah [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8866.52s)]
*  don't like an anti-war protest. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8871.0s)]
*  Screw them. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8872.6s)]
*  But think about the whole context of it. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8873.480000000001s)]
*  This is a pretty small town. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8875.400000000001s)]
*  All of a sudden, 100 people all move in at once together and they have a leader. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8877.560000000001s)]
*  You just think about that part. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8884.12s)]
*  They have a leader. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8885.240000000002s)]
*  You know, what do you mean? [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8887.08s)]
*  He's like the leader of your church? [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8888.28s)]
*  No, he's our leader. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8890.2s)]
*  Okay. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8893.320000000002s)]
*  You know, that's pretty weird, right? [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8894.92s)]
*  They do everything together. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8897.240000000002s)]
*  They don't really associate much with the rest of the community and they have a leader. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8898.52s)]
*  And almost as soon as they're settled in, they're marching down your downtown street [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8904.04s)]
*  for a cause that, I mean, you know, right or wrong, they knew damn well was going to [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8908.28s)]
*  run contrary to many of the people in your conservative town. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8913.4s)]
*  You know, who are these people? [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8917.96s)]
*  We didn't do anything to you. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8919.32s)]
*  You're just going to barge into our town, you know, en masse, acting all strange, [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8920.279999999999s)]
*  and your kids stick together on the playground and don't interact with any of the other kids [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8925.24s)]
*  at school, and now you're waving signs in our faces and yelling about politics while [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8929.0s)]
*  we're trying to go to the supermarket. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8933.64s)]
*  You know, it's a bold thing to do and it's kind of a strange thing to do. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8935.48s)]
*  And it's a knowingly confrontational thing to do. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8939.88s)]
*  And it got the reaction that you would expect. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8943.72s)]
*  And to be honest, the reaction that Jim Jones probably expected. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8945.72s)]
*  For a group like this, you need there to be a barrier between the people and the rest [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8951.0s)]
*  of the community for it to stick together over time. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8956.92s)]
*  I don't know if Jim Jones thinks about it consciously that way, you know, setting up [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8961.64s)]
*  situations like this on purpose to make sure his people are kind of alienated from the [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8966.44s)]
*  community and therefore, you know, bound more tightly and securely to one another. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8970.28s)]
*  I don't know if that's something conscious. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8975.320000000002s)]
*  You know, his biographers always assume that he was that cunning and cynical and that [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8976.84s)]
*  everything is kind of a manipulation like that. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8981.960000000001s)]
*  But to be honest, as far as I can tell, that's just an assumption. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8983.960000000001s)]
*  I don't think there's any information that kind of gives anybody that idea. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8987.560000000001s)]
*  I think it was just their way. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8991.08s)]
*  I think it was his way, but also his people's way. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8992.52s)]
*  They were out to change the world and they took that seriously. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8994.76s)]
*  And if anyone had a problem with it, then not only were they not going to accommodate [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=8997.8s)]
*  those people, you know, they were going to make something of it. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9003.16s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's the mentality of, you know, why can't the, you know, the left-wing [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9007.56s)]
*  gender queer feminist granddaughter just kind of roll her eyes and ignore grandpa at [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9014.84s)]
*  Thanksgiving when he makes some, you know, positive remark about Donald Trump rather [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9020.039999999999s)]
*  than blowing up the dinner by starting an argument with him about it? [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9024.199999999999s)]
*  Because screw him. Why should she? [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9028.119999999999s)]
*  You know, not everyone's like that, but Jim Jones was like that and his people were like that. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9030.759999999998s)]
*  And, you know, maybe there's a bit of truth to the biographer's cynical interpretation, [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9036.119999999999s)]
*  too, to be fair. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9040.519999999999s)]
*  But in any case, they were going to be right at home in California as the fateful [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9042.599999999999s)]
*  revolutionary year of 1968 came into view. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9049.0s)]
*  Paul Berman, a writer who, he was a left-wing veteran of this period, sympathetic veteran, [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9051.96s)]
*  you know, he writes about it with sympathy. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9059.56s)]
*  He remembered those days. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9062.519999999999s)]
*  He said, quote, In the years around 1968, a utopian exhilaration swept across the student [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9064.199999999999s)]
*  universe and across several adult universes as well. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9071.48s)]
*  And almost everyone in my own circle of friends and classmates was caught up in it. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9074.759999999998s)]
*  The exhilaration was partly a fury against some well-known social injustices and against some [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9079.32s)]
*  injustices that had always remained hidden. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9086.12s)]
*  Partly it was a belief, hard to remember today except in a cartoon version, that [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9088.76s)]
*  a superior new society was already coming into existence. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9093.800000000001s)]
*  And it was the belief that we ourselves, the teenage revolutionaries, freaks, hippies, [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9097.960000000001s)]
*  and students, together with our friends and leaders who were five or ten years older [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9103.24s)]
*  and our allies around the world, stood at the heart of that new society. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9107.4s)]
*  Our own student uprisings, the building occupations, marches, strikes, battles with [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9112.6s)]
*  the police, the insurrections that were sexual, feminist and gay, the bursts of ecological [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9118.119999999999s)]
*  passion, the noisy entrance of the first mass group of African-American students into the [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9123.4s)]
*  previously segregated American universities, the slightly crazy effort to raise insubordination [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9128.279999999999s)]
*  into a culture, to eat, dress, smoke, dance differently. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9134.44s)]
*  It was a political insurrection, but also an insurrection in middle-class customs, a phrase [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9139.640000000001s)]
*  that we would have loathed. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9145.08s)]
*  In the last episode, I tried to describe the development of the African-American protest [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9148.36s)]
*  movement from the nonviolent civil rights demonstrations of the early 60s through the [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9153.960000000001s)]
*  beginnings of the black power, more militant movement later in the decade, and how that [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9158.76s)]
*  transformation was partly a generational conflict. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9164.92s)]
*  You know, younger activists like Stokely Carmichael and Rat Brown, you know, while men like Martin [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9167.800000000001s)]
*  Luther King and his allies kind of tried to hold back the tide of militancy. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9174.36s)]
*  Well, there was a parallel generational conflict going on at the same time within the white [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9179.800000000001s)]
*  American left. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9184.68s)]
*  Well, I mean, these groups weren't white in the way that civil rights or black power [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9186.439999999999s)]
*  groups were black, but the people in them were white almost entirely. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9189.8s)]
*  And they followed closely the transformation from black protest to black militancy with [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9193.64s)]
*  their own movement from reformed socialism to revolutionary communism. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9200.039999999999s)]
*  Now, anyone who knows me, anyone who follows me on Twitter, which is not something that [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9206.84s)]
*  I can recommend, knows how much I hate communism. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9213.16s)]
*  I can give reasons, but I don't claim to be rational about it. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9218.68s)]
*  I've just read too much history and it's left too deep a mark. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9222.52s)]
*  But you know who hated communists even more than me? [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9228.52s)]
*  It might surprise you. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9230.92s)]
*  In the 20th century, you would have been hard pressed to find any group of people who abhorred [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9233.72s)]
*  communism more than American socialists. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9239.32s)]
*  And their reasons were better than mine. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9242.519999999999s)]
*  To them, communism was not an abstract evil. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9245.48s)]
*  Okay, many of America's left-wing institutions were populated with recent generation immigrants [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9250.279999999999s)]
*  from southern and eastern Europe and who still had family and friends behind the eastern [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9255.56s)]
*  bloc. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9259.88s)]
*  So they knew firsthand the evil that had been done in the name of communism. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9260.119999999999s)]
*  But knowing about the reality of Stalinism obviously doesn't automatically turn a worker [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9265.56s)]
*  into a supporter of fascism. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9269.88s)]
*  These people were still solid democratic socialists, but they were also solid Americans. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9271.16s)]
*  You know, they liked the New Deal. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9277.48s)]
*  The communists didn't like the New Deal because improving the lives of workers in their view, [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9279.32s)]
*  that little bit, it made it harder to win them over for the cause of revolution. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9284.039999999999s)]
*  There were still reforms to fight for, but these people who had been through the battles of the [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9291.32s)]
*  30s and 40s, who gutted out the Great Depression and had a tragic perspective on how horribly [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9296.12s)]
*  wrong things can go when they do go wrong, they knew that America was no hellscape. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9302.12s)]
*  The trade unions and student organizations and all the leftist policy organizations in the US, [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9308.12s)]
*  they had a hard and fast rule against communists. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9314.52s)]
*  You don't even let them in the door. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9318.12s)]
*  These were lessons that they had learned the hard way over decades of going to war [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9321.400000000001s)]
*  with communists over control of America's leftist institutions. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9325.8s)]
*  In Holocaust histories, you'll hear about the time that supporters of Hitler's regime filled [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9330.359999999999s)]
*  up Madison Square Garden for a rally. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9334.759999999998s)]
*  Around that same time, the garden was filled up by a bunch of socialists, [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9337.4s)]
*  but they weren't rallying against Nazis. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9341.64s)]
*  They were making a show of force against the pro-Soviet communists who had recently [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9343.8s)]
*  packed themselves into Yankee Stadium. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9347.48s)]
*  The socialists knew from bitter experience that in America, [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9350.199999999999s)]
*  communists were a far greater danger to the left than fascists had ever been. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9354.6s)]
*  And this was a lesson, though, that had to be taught anew to each left-wing generation. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9360.92s)]
*  It's not going to be immediately obvious to the younger leftists and the student groups [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9366.28s)]
*  why communism, yeah, perhaps not the Soviets or the Chinese, you know, maybe they weren't [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9370.52s)]
*  doing it right, but communism in principle excited such hostility in the adults who were [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9375.56s)]
*  in charge of the adult socialist organizations. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9382.119999999999s)]
*  Young people often tend toward extremism anyway, and they kind of viewed the temperate energy [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9385.96s)]
*  of their elders as apathy or laziness. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9391.0s)]
*  That's kind of a common way for young people to look at that. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9393.8s)]
*  They lacked the perspective of the elders on the achievements that had already been hard won. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9398.6s)]
*  They grew up taking for granted improvements that the elders had bled for in jails and on [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9402.84s)]
*  picket lines. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9408.12s)]
*  And to many young people who had never really experienced repression or violence in any [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9409.960000000001s)]
*  meaningful way, the revolution, let's be honest, is just sexier than reform. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9414.6s)]
*  And so they had to be taught. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9421.16s)]
*  And until they were properly taught, they'd simply have to be told, no communism, period. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9423.16s)]
*  See, again, the elders had seen the movie before many times, and they were not interested [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9430.359999999999s)]
*  in seeing it again. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9434.76s)]
*  They knew what happened the moment you made an exception and cracked the door open for those [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9435.64s)]
*  people just a little bit. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9440.52s)]
*  Once the communists were inside, you no longer had a democratic organization. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9443.08s)]
*  Instead of members discussing the policies and direction of the group and in which they [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9449.16s)]
*  were all invested and then voting or compromising the political system, they were all [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9453.64s)]
*  invested and then voting or compromising to find a consensus. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9457.48s)]
*  The communists didn't work that way. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9461.4s)]
*  The communists worked together in a disciplined block, taking orders directly from party [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9462.92s)]
*  headquarters on what they should do. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9467.56s)]
*  Before long, they'd take control of one or two committees, and then they would leverage [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9470.119999999999s)]
*  the power they had in those committees to push or block according to the directives [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9474.76s)]
*  of their party bosses. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9478.359999999999s)]
*  It would all be done according to the democratic bylaws of the institution, technically, [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9480.359999999999s)]
*  but those democratic bylaws assumed good faith. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9486.759999999998s)]
*  But they knew that the social democrats were going to be loathed to violate those bylaws [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9491.72s)]
*  because then how are they any different from the communists? [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9495.48s)]
*  But these communists, they weren't operating in good faith. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9500.199999999999s)]
*  They were working toward a different purpose, trying to subvert the institution so that [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9502.199999999999s)]
*  it could be put to use by the larger communist organism. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9507.32s)]
*  And so bit by bit, they would frustrate and overwhelm everybody else. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9511.64s)]
*  All those mere individuals who were voting according to their conscience and reason, [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9515.32s)]
*  but not according to any party program. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9520.279999999999s)]
*  And then that would be that. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9523.4s)]
*  Once the communists had control, they had the power to change the rules to make sure [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9525.16s)]
*  that they kept it, and then it was all over. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9528.68s)]
*  This had happened many, many times to many leftist groups, and in every case, it was [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9531.56s)]
*  the death knell for that institution. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9536.76s)]
*  These socialists, the democratic socialists, they were Americans. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9540.119999999999s)]
*  They fought a class war on behalf of American workers. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9543.56s)]
*  During the Second World War, FDR had forged a settlement between the classes that the [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9548.119999999999s)]
*  socialists knew represented some pretty good progress. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9553.16s)]
*  But revolutionaries are not looking for a settlement. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9558.439999999999s)]
*  They're looking for victory. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9560.84s)]
*  And the communists were the explicit enemies of the United States, literally. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9562.519999999999s)]
*  They aligned themselves with Moscow. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9567.72s)]
*  Once they seized control of one of these socialist organizations, it became a weapon [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9569.48s)]
*  in the hands of the international communist movement with very different goals from anything [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9574.52s)]
*  that had gone before with the socialists in control. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9579.08s)]
*  At that point, it was just a matter of time before Joe McCarthy or J. Edgar Hoover, whoever, [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9583.96s)]
*  took out his fork and knife and just ate them all for breakfast. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9589.8s)]
*  And there was going to be no one there to defend them. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9593.56s)]
*  You want to call yourself an enemy of the United States government? [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9596.039999999999s)]
*  Roger that. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9598.92s)]
*  You can get treated like one. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9599.64s)]
*  Worse, the damage would never be contained to that one organization. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9602.28s)]
*  The people who had previously been involved with the organization, even people who had left [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9607.08s)]
*  because the communists came around, inevitably picked up some of the stink. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9611.08s)]
*  They'd been involved with a communist organization, [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9616.36s)]
*  maybe with proven ties to Moscow, as was often the case. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9618.92s)]
*  Joe McCarthy was not interested in hearing your excuses or the convoluted history of [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9623.08s)]
*  your organization. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9627.24s)]
*  And so now, whatever organizations you were currently involved with, [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9629.32s)]
*  they had to answer up for why they had members who had known ties to communism. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9633.0s)]
*  It gave the hardcore anti-leftists in the country enough ammunition to do so much damage to the [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9637.72s)]
*  American left, not only through these investigations, but by using this to smear a whole swath to the [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9643.4s)]
*  left with the communist brush, it would take years and years to recover. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9649.08s)]
*  And many of the old grizzled socialist veterans of the labor wars, they knew that they really [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9652.92s)]
*  only had themselves to blame for it. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9659.64s)]
*  We should have known better than to let those goddamn totalitarians in the door. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9661.16s)]
*  Well, by the 1950s, that lesson had been learned. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9667.48s)]
*  You know, it had been seared into the individual and institutional memories of America's left. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9671.24s)]
*  After 1956, with the revelations regarding the nature of the Soviet regime by de-Stalinization [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9676.6s)]
*  and Khrushchev's brutal invasion of Hungary, communism in the US was eviscerated. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9682.6s)]
*  You know, the official party, the American Communist Party, all but collapsed. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9687.480000000001s)]
*  And, you know, at the time, the economy's humming, workers' lives are improving. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9692.36s)]
*  You know, the legitimacy of the government, you look at polls from the time, I mean, it's just [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9697.240000000002s)]
*  skyrocketing. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9702.36s)]
*  Even labor had, it seemed to have a pretty secure place in politics, had a voice. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9703.24s)]
*  But then, of course, because God has a great sense of humor, that's when everything got [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9710.039999999999s)]
*  a million times more complicated. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9716.36s)]
*  By the late 50s, it was fairly straightforward for the adults, the adult left to explain to [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9720.039999999999s)]
*  the student left that communism was bad and they should have nothing to do with it. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9725.88s)]
*  Pretty straightforward case. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9729.64s)]
*  Communism at the time meant the Soviet Union. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9731.4s)]
*  And it was easy enough, you know, not to side with an enemy superpower that, even applying [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9734.439999999999s)]
*  the most ungenerous lens to America, had at least as much to answer for as your own country. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9740.52s)]
*  The case got more difficult to make when revolutions in the Third World started up. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9747.08s)]
*  And some of those revolutions were, you know, the most difficult to make. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9753.88s)]
*  And some of those post-colonial states that resulted from those revolutions started calling [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9757.08s)]
*  themselves communist. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9764.52s)]
*  It was one thing for America's vast military to stand toe to toe, you know, in Germany [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9767.4s)]
*  against the Red Army. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9772.52s)]
*  Things began to look a lot different to some people when we started turning our attention [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9773.48s)]
*  to places like Cuba. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9778.039999999999s)]
*  The Cubans had no sooner won their revolution to overthrow a corrupt military dictatorship [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9780.92s)]
*  than the American government set itself the task of destroying the new regime. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9786.52s)]
*  And this didn't look like self-defense under any reasonable definition of the term, [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9791.32s)]
*  you know, to these people. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9795.640000000001s)]
*  It looked like an attempt to reinforce a regime of control left over from an era of [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9797.08s)]
*  colonial domination that America was, according to the great mythology of the country, [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9802.52s)]
*  officially supposed to have stood against. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9806.84s)]
*  Our strategy of containment meant that, you know, we would not attack the Soviet Union, [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9808.76s)]
*  but we would oppose the spread of communism anywhere in the world. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9814.2s)]
*  And what this ended up meaning in practice was that America became the enemy of many [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9818.12s)]
*  much smaller, weaker countries, many of whom had just emerged from, you know, colonialism [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9822.36s)]
*  in parts of the world that, you know, had been formerly dominated by Europe. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9829.4s)]
*  Obviously, the Soviet propaganda wrote itself. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9832.92s)]
*  They were supporting national liberation movements against colonial domination, [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9836.679999999998s)]
*  while America had taken up the sword from the depleted colonial powers, you know, [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9840.439999999999s)]
*  to keep the Third World in its place. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9844.759999999998s)]
*  Now, when a communist was banned from entering a meeting of an organization like the Students [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9849.24s)]
*  for a Democratic Society, SDS, which was the largest left-wing student group in the country, [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9855.96s)]
*  the communists could not stand up to the communist movement. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9862.039999999999s)]
*  The communists could say, what? I'm not allowed to support the Cubans? [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9865.08s)]
*  I'm not allowed to like Che? [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9868.92s)]
*  And many of the younger leftists, they found that quite persuasive, you know. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9872.2s)]
*  I mean, when the leaders of SDS got together on Lake Michigan [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9875.800000000001s)]
*  to put together their famous Port Huron statement, it was only at the absolute insistence of the [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9879.720000000001s)]
*  adult organization that paid their bills that they included an anti-communist clause [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9884.92s)]
*  in the form of a statement in amitizing totalitarianism. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9890.12s)]
*  Well, things got, I mean, even worse, just considerably more complicated [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9895.32s)]
*  as America became involved in Vietnam. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9899.880000000001s)]
*  It was hard to even come up with a pretense of a rationale [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9903.560000000001s)]
*  that could plausibly sound like self-defense to the student left. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9908.2s)]
*  At least Cuba was 90 miles from Florida and had officially declared for the Soviet Union, right? [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9912.52s)]
*  The students didn't buy that rationale, but they could at least believe that others did. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9918.28s)]
*  The domino theory, you know, justifying our involvement in Vietnam seems so abstract, [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9921.88s)]
*  they just couldn't take it seriously. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9926.359999999999s)]
*  In what imaginable world could Vietnam threaten the United States, [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9928.679999999998s)]
*  whatever form of government it had and whoever its allies were. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9933.64s)]
*  But again, the adult left did not want to hear it. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9938.519999999999s)]
*  They were not interested and they were unbending. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9940.92s)]
*  Because again, they had seen the movie before, they knew how it ended. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9944.199999999999s)]
*  So they were firm and final, no communism, end of freaking story. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9947.56s)]
*  If you want to chant ho ho ho chi min, you can do it somewhere else, [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9953.08s)]
*  because in this place you are not welcome. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9956.84s)]
*  In 63 and 64, the country's political attention, you know, was fixed on Martin Luther King, [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9960.84s)]
*  JFK's murder, Johnson versus Goldwater and the escalating racial strife in the South. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9967.0s)]
*  While our involvement in Vietnam was not a big deal, [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9972.279999999999s)]
*  involvement in Vietnam was still limited to providing some military advisors and logistical [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9975.96s)]
*  support to help the South Vietnamese government fight its war against the communist North. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9981.56s)]
*  64, President Johnson ran the campaign promising that our involvement would stay that way. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9987.08s)]
*  Maybe we could plausibly argue that we were supporting, you know, [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9993.4s)]
*  that we were supporting again in a very limited way the recognized legitimate government of [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=9998.039999999999s)]
*  Vietnam, the one with a seat at the UN against a dangerous subversive threat. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10002.28s)]
*  But that pretense collapsed in 1965. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10009.320000000002s)]
*  With the election over, Johnson was sworn in in January of 65 and just two months later, [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10013.08s)]
*  we invaded Vietnam. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10018.52s)]
*  The government we were supposed to be supporting by that point had no meaningful support or [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10021.800000000001s)]
*  legitimacy with its own people. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10026.6s)]
*  It was completely incapable of carrying on the war against the North. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10028.6s)]
*  So we just pushed that government aside like, you know, we'll take it from here. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10031.8s)]
*  In the election year, 64, we'd had about 23,000 military advisors in the country. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10037.0s)]
*  By 1965, we had 180,000 boots on the ground. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10042.92s)]
*  Well, 360,000 if you count both feet. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10046.92s)]
*  In 66, it was a quarter million. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10050.76s)]
*  By 1968, there's over half a million American troops patrolling those jungles. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10052.84s)]
*  And of course, I mean, the optics were outrageous. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10057.96s)]
*  You got these cone-hatted peasants. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10062.039999999999s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, the Vietnamese were warriors. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10066.68s)]
*  But if you just saw pictures of this stuff, you got these cone-hatted peasants ducking [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10069.56s)]
*  for cover as our B-52s are dropping more bombs on Vietnam than we had dropped on Germany [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10074.44s)]
*  and Japan combined during the entire Second World War. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10079.72s)]
*  Second World War. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10083.48s)]
*  The student left found our opposition to Cuba hard enough to handle, but this was not the Bay [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10087.08s)]
*  of Pigs anymore. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10092.039999999999s)]
*  They looked to their anti-communist elders and said, hey, you told us the Soviets were [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10094.6s)]
*  bad for what they did to Hungary in 1956, and we believed you. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10101.16s)]
*  What do you call this? [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10105.32s)]
*  But it had no effect. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10107.8s)]
*  I mean, the old left were either anti-communist enough that they just found it difficult [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10109.32s)]
*  to take a firm stand against an anti-communist war, although that would very quickly change [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10115.72s)]
*  as the war's nature became clearer, to be fair. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10121.4s)]
*  Or else there was just the fact that these old trade unionists and social Democrats, [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10124.68s)]
*  social democratic veterans of those picket lines, they just weren't primarily oriented [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10131.72s)]
*  toward foreign policy at all. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10137.16s)]
*  It takes time to change an approach that's shaped your view of politics in the world [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10139.64s)]
*  your whole life. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10145.24s)]
*  Maybe they deplored the war, but it wasn't, at least at first, it wasn't looming for them [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10145.8s)]
*  as large as it was to the younger left-wing generation. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10151.4s)]
*  The left-wingers would come, can you believe this? [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10154.68s)]
*  Oh my god, this war, it's so awful. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10157.56s)]
*  And the adults are like, yeah, yeah, it's awful. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10159.64s)]
*  It's terrible. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10162.84s)]
*  We're totally against it. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10163.32s)]
*  We're going to vote also the same people you are for it to stop. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10164.28s)]
*  That emotional disconnect was extremely strong and very frustrating to the younger people. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10168.359999999999s)]
*  And the adults, the adults were becoming annoyed at the students' [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10175.32s)]
*  tolerance of this new communist heresy, and the students were becoming dismissive [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10179.24s)]
*  and belligerent toward the adults, and relations just deteriorated until finally in 1965, [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10183.16s)]
*  the year that we invaded Vietnam, SDS voted to drop the anti-totalitarian clause in its [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10189.8s)]
*  charter altogether. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10196.199999999999s)]
*  And they cracked the door open for the communists. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10197.72s)]
*  They just couldn't any longer justify keeping people out merely because they were supporters [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10202.439999999999s)]
*  of the North Vietnamese. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10208.679999999998s)]
*  The anti-communism that so anachronistically to them obsessed the adult left, it sounded [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10211.32s)]
*  like the same rhetoric the US government was using to justify its slaughter in Vietnam. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10217.48s)]
*  And more and more, they came to see the plotting, reform-minded, democratic socialism of their [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10221.24s)]
*  elders the way Lenin had described it as the left wing of imperialism, providing cover [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10229.08s)]
*  for it. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10234.36s)]
*  And on top of everything, you can imagine this, I can certainly imagine it, to the younger [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10235.72s)]
*  group, the adults' obsession here, it just sounded like absurd paranoia in the 1960s. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10243.24s)]
*  This isn't the 1930s, grandpa, what do you think's going to happen? [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10251.4s)]
*  The commies are going to sneak into SDS and subvert us and take over the organization [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10254.84s)]
*  from the inside? [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10259.32s)]
*  Ooh. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10260.199999999999s)]
*  And the adults are like, yes, you damn idiots, that is exactly what's going to happen. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10262.199999999999s)]
*  And they officially cut ties with the student movement after they dropped that anti-totalitarian [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10267.8s)]
*  clause. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10272.76s)]
*  And then the socialists in the old left shook their heads and they watched from a distance [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10274.199999999999s)]
*  as the new left cut its mooring lines and careened toward a cliff, the exact cliff that [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10278.92s)]
*  they had been trying to warn them about. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10285.56s)]
*  It took less than two years for the adults to be proven right. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10289.0s)]
*  By the time the students learned that their parents might have had a point, it was too [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10292.36s)]
*  late. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10295.960000000001s)]
*  By 1967, communists had taken control of SDS, and by 1969, that old venerable organization, [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10296.52s)]
*  which had been around since 1905 and had its roots in the grandest traditions the American [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10304.759999999998s)]
*  left, started by people like Upton Sinclair and Jack London, would no longer exist. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10310.039999999999s)]
*  When the student left, cut itself off from the traditional American left, it cut itself [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10317.56s)]
*  off from the institutional memory that might have kind of told it what to expect and given [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10322.599999999999s)]
*  them half a chance to fight back. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10328.119999999999s)]
*  As it happened, they were completely defenseless. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10329.56s)]
*  When a sect based out of Harvard calling itself Progressive Labor put SDS on the dinner menu, [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10332.68s)]
*  and our guide in this subject, Paul Berman, again a left-wing veteran of all this, he [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10338.68s)]
*  describes what happened. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10343.72s)]
*  Quote, Progressive Labor was more communist than the communists. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10344.439999999999s)]
*  PL was pro-Beijing, admired Stalin, worshiped Mao. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10350.199999999999s)]
*  Looking at these Progressive Labor people, you could have easily shown them that they [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10355.32s)]
*  could have easily shared the disbelief of many anti-communist SDSers that any kind of [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10358.68s)]
*  communist infiltration could get anywhere at all. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10364.2s)]
*  Progressive Labor was the antithesis of every rebellious instinct in SDS. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10367.24s)]
*  The PLers struck genuine SDSers as robots. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10372.04s)]
*  They wore anti-hippie short haircuts, which made them look like Marines, except with the [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10375.720000000001s)]
*  flabby muscles and pale complexions of bookish personalities, and they maintained a Marine-like [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10380.6s)]
*  discipline too. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10385.800000000001s)]
*  Their manner at meetings was notoriously patient and manipulative. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10387.24s)]
*  They raised their hands and quoted Stalin or Mao in flat tones that were oddly remote [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10390.52s)]
*  from American English. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10395.32s)]
*  Yet something about the PL spirit was in keeping with the era. [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10396.68s)]
*  Maybe there was, after all, a link, faint though it had to be, between the young, far-away red [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10401.32s)]
*  guards of Mao's Cultural Revolution and the young rebels of the Western world. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10406.76s)]
*  Soon enough, the PL student Maoists and the occasional assistant professor were attending [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10410.76s)]
*  every meeting of SDS they could find, carrying out a disciplined infiltration that was coordinated [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10415.48s)]
*  from party headquarters, and the relatively disorganized SDS socialists, ignorant of their [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10420.52s)]
*  own history, that might have taught them how to resist were in no position to do so. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10425.880000000001s)]
*  The deadpan Maoist rhetoric sounded weird, but back then weirdness was good. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10430.36s)]
*  Many a student revolutionary who was privately frightened out of his wits, was a good example [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10435.800000000001s)]
*  of the hippie counterculture, discovered with great fascination that PL, in its scary Chinese [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10440.6s)]
*  fashion, offered a counter-counterculture, which was exceedingly straight, yet exceedingly [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10446.2s)]
*  radical. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10451.400000000001s)]
*  The PLers gave up cigarettes. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10452.84s)]
*  These were not potheads. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10454.84s)]
*  Their look may have been androidal, but at least they weren't fashionable. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10457.08s)]
*  Their attitude toward ordinary working people was laughably paternalistic, but they did [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10461.0s)]
*  at least pretend to sympathy, which was better than some of the anti-PLers managed to do. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10465.320000000002s)]
*  And because of the machine gun efficiency of their Leninist discipline, plus the allure [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10470.68s)]
*  of their ghastly Chinese rhetoric and the reassurance that came from their stodgy cultural [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10474.84s)]
*  ideas, the Maoists in chapter after chapter were able to rope in a handful of students, [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10479.0s)]
*  long enough, to get them to vote at one or two meetings, which was sufficient to take [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10484.28s)]
*  over a committee, then to influence the chapter, and sometimes to take over entirely. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10488.68s)]
*  The PLers managed to confuse the SDS rank and file with their accusations of [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10495.24s)]
*  anti-communism directed at anyone who spoke against them, since by the time of their [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10499.56s)]
*  challenge, 1967-69, it had become impossible for true SDSers to affirm anti-communism as [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10503.88s)]
*  the movement's proper doctrine. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10510.76s)]
*  Almost five decades of left-wing repudiation of communism lay in the SDS's past, but the [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10513.24s)]
*  break between generations had performed a kind of lobotomy on the collective student [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10519.24s)]
*  brain and the whole previous experience of the American left had disappeared from memory, [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10523.16s)]
*  except for the great history that was passed along through family tradition. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10528.04s)]
*  And since, in no small number of cases, family tradition among SDSers contained a fond nostalgia [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10532.6s)]
*  for the Communist Party of the 30s and 40s and a keen appreciation of the non-party [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10538.6s)]
*  communism that flowered at monthly review in the National Guardian during the 50s, [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10543.160000000002s)]
*  living memory tended to become, for SDS, a celebration of American communism and of [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10548.04s)]
*  everything that accorded with it, with the communist past, and of nothing that did not. [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10553.24s)]
*  In SDS, the phrase social democracy came to mean the left-wing of imperialism, exactly [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10558.92s)]
*  as in the writings of Lenin. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10564.84s)]
*  So the crew-cut robots stood up and quoted Stalin. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10567.64s)]
*  No one among the ordinary SDSers knew what was wrong with Stalin, except that maybe he [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10571.0s)]
*  went too far, that Trotsky was vaguely preferable. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10575.48s)]
*  No one knew how to explain that Lenin was a dictator. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10578.92s)]
*  The short hairs chanted, smash red-baiting! [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10582.199999999999s)]
*  The long hairs, speechless, adopted the fateful strategy of opposition by imitation. [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10585.16s)]
*  They went thumbing through the handsome little pamphlets published by China's Foreign Language [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10590.68s)]
*  Press, looking for Maoist quotations to hurl back at the Maoists. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10594.76s)]
*  They read North Vietnamese pamphlets and speeches by Fidel Castro. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10599.0s)]
*  The little Lenin library became a common possession. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10602.92s)]
*  Stalin's theory of nationalism was everyone's favorite reading. [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10606.76s)]
*  And by provoking those several responses, the robots of progressive labor did more damage [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10610.679999999998s)]
*  to SDS than a thousand secret police agents. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10616.599999999999s)]
*  Now there had never been, there never was a lot of ideological sympathy for progressive labor [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10621.96s)]
*  inside SDS, but that didn't matter. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10628.359999999999s)]
*  They had control of the organization. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10631.0s)]
*  They knew, as all revolutionaries must know, that a keyed-up mass of individuals is nothing more [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10633.88s)]
*  than a weapon in the hands of any disciplined cadre that knows how to pick it up and put it to use. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10641.64s)]
*  They managed to maintain control of SDS through the crazy year of 1968, but the direction of [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10647.64s)]
*  events in American culture meant that a Marxist, nostalgic cult like P.L. was inevitably [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10653.32s)]
*  going to be pushed out by a group who better understood which way the wind was blowing. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10659.16s)]
*  In fact, that was how they got their name from a Bob Dylan lyric. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10664.84s)]
*  You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10669.08s)]
*  I need to give you a little background before we get into weatherman. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10674.04s)]
*  Because I think it's easy to think that this is just a bunch of crazy people, [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10678.52s)]
*  especially since if you ran into a group of them, half of them would be on acid or speed, [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10682.68s)]
*  and the other half would be on both. But everything has an internal logic to it. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10687.88s)]
*  And what led weatherman to the conclusion that armed guerrilla warfare against the United States [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10694.679999999998s)]
*  government was a reasonable political pathway, it sheds a lot of light on how Jim Jones and [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10701.08s)]
*  People's Temple arrived at the crazy conclusions that drove them out into the jungle. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10706.519999999999s)]
*  I'll draw on Paul Berman again. He's kind of my guide for this period among just a few other [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10710.6s)]
*  people. And again, I want to emphasize he's a left-wing chronicler of this period. He has a [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10714.92s)]
*  generally sympathetic approach to the motivations that drove many of the people that he knew at [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10719.720000000001s)]
*  the time in such wild directions. He wrote, quote, the new left was a young people's movement [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10725.56s)]
*  motivated by fear. Naturally, not just by fear. New leftists all over the world knew very well [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10733.88s)]
*  that in the decades after World War Two, European imperialism was steadily collapsing around the [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10739.8s)]
*  world. And certain kinds of social progress were advancing nicely in Western countries and might [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10744.6s)]
*  go on advancing to given a proper left wing push. Utopian cheerfulness was a sunbeam that fell here [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10749.8s)]
*  and there. It fear swallowed it all. It was a fear that at least in the Western countries, [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10757.48s)]
*  social progress rested on a lie. A fear that prosperity was theft and Western wealth was [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10764.84s)]
*  third world exploitation. A fear that Western civilization comprised an all-encompassing system [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10772.04s)]
*  of manipulation designed to mislead its own people and everyone else. An iron cage that [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10778.04s)]
*  cleverly designed to resemble the open air of freedom. End quote. So what could drive a bunch [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10784.279999999999s)]
*  of mostly wealthy privileged white kids from the Ivy League to begin to see their world in those [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10793.0s)]
*  terms? And maybe the first thing that is hard to avoid noticing about weathermen when you study [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10800.599999999999s)]
*  them. It's a delicate thing to notice but it has to be addressed because it's kind of important, [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10809.8s)]
*  is that virtually all of them were Jewish. And why that's worth noticing is the reason it's worth [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10815.24s)]
*  noticing the overwhelming role of Jewish Americans, the role that they played in all of the social [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10821.56s)]
*  justice and left-wing radical movements of this era. I mean Jews were even well represented in [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10827.0s)]
*  the leadership of people's temple, ostensibly a Christian church, very well represented actually. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10832.039999999999s)]
*  In the previous episode we discussed the freedom riders pretty in depth and I mentioned that the [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10836.28s)]
*  freedom riders consisted of both black and white young activists riding buses into the deep south [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10841.08s)]
*  to challenge local segregation laws. What I didn't mention was that those white freedom riders were [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10846.04s)]
*  almost all Jewish. Not all but four out of five. That was all the way back in 1961 when most of [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10853.0s)]
*  white America was only just beginning to wake up to what was going on down there. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10862.199999999999s)]
*  And they're already involved, they're on the front lines. It's not hard to puzzle out the reason why [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10867.88s)]
*  Jews were among the first white people to really start paying serious attention to the plight of [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10875.16s)]
*  blacks suffered under Jim Crow. I don't think you have to, you know, you don't have to think too [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10880.599999999999s)]
*  hard about that one. It's not hard to think about it. It's not hard to think about it. It's not hard [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10885.56s)]
*  to know about it. It's just another big one. The freedom rides took place, just 16 years after [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10891.88s)]
*  the end of the second world war. While angular and white ethnic kids of the baby boom grew up [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10897.32s)]
*  hearing about the heroic exploits of the greatest generation and the victory over fascism, [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10903.0s)]
*  young Jews grew up hearing, yes that story too, but something else besides that. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10909.16s)]
*  They learned how safe and civilized the world around you might seem, you can never really [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10914.76s)]
*  be sure. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10922.800000000001s)]
*  And they've been taught to look for the signs. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10925.0s)]
*  When images of brutality against blacks in the South began to be broadcast into American [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10929.34s)]
*  living rooms, a lot of good white Americans saw the carnage and thought, I can't believe [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10934.4s)]
*  this is happening in our country. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10941.4s)]
*  How can my fellow Americans treat other human beings in such a manner? [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10944.44s)]
*  These are not our values. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10948.960000000001s)]
*  This is not who we are. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10950.66s)]
*  But a lot of young Jews saw those same images of men in uniforms holding snapping German [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10952.52s)]
*  shepherds a few inches back from the faces of terrified black men, women, and children, [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10961.480000000001s)]
*  while rage-crazed civilian mobs hurled insults and stones at them, and very different thoughts [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10967.800000000001s)]
*  ran through their heads. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10975.08s)]
*  They saw those images and thought, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I know what [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10978.220000000001s)]
*  this is. [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10984.52s)]
*  I've seen this before. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10986.800000000001s)]
*  No, no way. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10988.640000000001s)]
*  Not this time. [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10990.84s)]
*  A lot of them got on those buses coming down from New York and Jersey and Cleveland and [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=10994.720000000001s)]
*  other northern cities, leaving behind very nice, perfectly comfortable lives, Ivy League [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11000.28s)]
*  enrollments. [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11006.92s)]
*  And they sat down next to black people that they had never met and had no earthly reason [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11008.6s)]
*  to care about. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11014.800000000001s)]
*  And they rode down into Jackson, Mississippi and Birmingham, Alabama and all the rest. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11016.2s)]
*  And they said, if you want to hurt them, you're going to have to hurt me too. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11021.12s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11025.960000000001s)]
*  These are real heroes, those freedom riders. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11029.08s)]
*  Some of the great people in American history, those white freedom riders, those Jewish freedom [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11032.92s)]
*  riders. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11039.160000000002s)]
*  They get lost in the shuffle a little bit sometimes because nobody wants to distract [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11040.160000000002s)]
*  from something that should really be about the African-American heroes, which is fine. [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11043.5s)]
*  But those black riders, and again, I absolutely do not mean to diminish anything, absolute [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11048.28s)]
*  heroes as well, but those black riders, they had a stake in this. [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11053.320000000002s)]
*  Those young Jews taking off from college to put their lives on the line, they didn't need [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11058.08s)]
*  to go down there. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11063.08s)]
*  We all had a stake in it as a country, as a people. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11065.12s)]
*  I'm not trying to say they deserve any more credit than the black riders, but those young [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11068.960000000001s)]
*  white people, mostly Jews who went down there, those are very, very special, very, very [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11072.900000000001s)]
*  brave people. [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11078.0s)]
*  I mentioned in that last episode that when the buses were attacked by mobs wielding bats, [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11081.48s)]
*  chains, boots, fire, sometimes worse, the white freedom riders were singled out for [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11087.0s)]
*  special abuse. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11093.64s)]
*  Well, those mobs were well aware that those white freedom riders were Jews. [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11094.64s)]
*  That's not the kind of thing that escaped people's attention back then. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11100.04s)]
*  Those young people got to see it firsthand and to feel it and to think about it while [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11104.84s)]

*  them in the hospitals. [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11115.28s)]
*  Their parents, the older left-wing generation that they were interacting with, again, this [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11119.0s)]
*  relates to the whole left-wing generational conflict I was talking about a minute ago [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11125.64s)]
*  in a little bit different context because a lot of their parents were those older socialists [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11129.92s)]
*  in those left-wing organizations. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11135.4s)]
*  A lot of these kids were in groups like SDS, but their parents had been through a lot by [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11136.92s)]
*  this point. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11143.48s)]
*  For a Jew who had fled the pogroms of the Russian Empire and toughed out the Great Depression [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11145.76s)]
*  or had made it out of Europe before the Nazi volcano exploded or, God forbid, had been [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11152.76s)]
*  in Europe during the war and managed to survive with their skin intact, for those people, [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11158.0s)]
*  it was really something to be able to raise their kids in peace in an American suburb [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11165.92s)]
*  and after everything to see them off to NYU or Columbia or the University of Chicago. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11171.88s)]
*  When those kids came back on summer break saying, Mom, Dad, it's happening again, you [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11180.04s)]
*  can maybe understand the parents saying, Son, listen, I don't like it any more than [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11186.4s)]
*  you do. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11191.76s)]
*  We're the ones that taught you, raised you not to like it. [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11192.76s)]
*  It's terrible. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11194.84s)]
*  But trust me, I know what fascism is. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11195.84s)]
*  And this, America, this ain't fascism. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11199.44s)]
*  And so the kids, you know, shocked and dismayed and angry at the, it wasn't apathy, but what [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11203.72s)]
*  they saw is kind of the apathy of their older generation. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11211.72s)]
*  They went their own way. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11216.439999999999s)]
*  And from there, the next leap was not as big as it might seem from far away. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11218.32s)]
*  Once they learned to identify with the blacks and to see the sheriffs and civilian mobs [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11224.64s)]
*  as Nazis and obedient Germans, it did not take much to start seeing the Wehrmacht and [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11230.279999999999s)]
*  SS and the US Army and to see Operation Rolling Thunder in Vietnam as just an updated version [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11235.68s)]
*  of Auschwitz. [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11242.48s)]
*  It was a vision began to appear, a vision of all the organized violence in the world [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11243.48s)]
*  coming together into one constellation of oppression and brutality. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11250.92s)]
*  A vision of all the world's downtrodden from African Americans to their distant African [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11256.92s)]
*  cousins, from all the peoples of Asia and Latin America struggling from under the legacy [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11263.92s)]
*  of colonialism to the Jewish victims of Treblinka and Kishinev, all pressed down into the dirt [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11268.92s)]
*  by one giant system of exploitation. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11276.24s)]
*  The very system from which these young Jews, they themselves were the beneficiaries, the [[03:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11279.44s)]
*  system that bought off their parents' consciences with that house in the suburbs. [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11286.8s)]
*  And was proposing to buy off their own with that nice college education. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11291.8s)]
*  And so suddenly everything beautiful began to look ugly. [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11299.679999999998s)]
*  And everything true started to look like a lie. [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11306.679999999998s)]
*  And a shadow fell over the world right before their eyes. [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11309.679999999998s)]
*  Paul Berman again, quote, the social optimism of the Jews, the social optimism of the Jews, [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11316.679999999998s)]
*  the social optimism of the New Left drew on visible realities of world history and so [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11321.88s)]
*  too did the fear. [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11325.759999999998s)]
*  New leftists from all over the world looked at the United States. [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11328.119999999999s)]
*  They saw that America's ancient prejudices against blacks had come at her challenge, [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11332.039999999999s)]
*  but the spectacle of America trying to reform itself succeeded only in revealing how persistent [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11336.679999999998s)]
*  were the ancient prejudices and therefore how limited and false must be America's claim [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11341.599999999999s)]
*  on democratic virtue. [[03:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11346.14s)]
*  New leftists gazed at the Cuban Revolution and at America's attempt to overthrow it [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11348.84s)]
*  in the invasion of the Bay of Pigs. [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11352.68s)]
*  Che Guevara had tried to stir up social revolution in South America and everyone knew that the [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11355.68s)]

*  New leftists gazed at Vietnam. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11364.48s)]
*  The fighting there had the look of a colonial war and an extremely ugly version. [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11366.880000000001s)]
*  A war no less racist under the Americans and under the French imperialists, except with [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11371.68s)]
*  the Madison Avenue smarminess, defense of the free world and a terrifying industrial [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11375.96s)]
*  face. [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11381.32s)]
*  American bomber planes overhead and cone-hatted rice farmers down below made an unbearable [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11383.279999999999s)]
*  spectacle, and the smarmy slogans together with the old-fashioned race hatreds and technological [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11387.72s)]
*  gasliness all of this aroused a dread, finally, that pointed to the terrors of the past. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11393.279999999999s)]
*  It was a fear in some that in World War II fascism and more specifically, Nazism, had [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11401.48s)]
*  not been defeated after all. [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11408.64s)]
*  A fear that Nazism, by mutating, had continued to thrive into the 1950s and 60s and onward, [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11411.08s)]
*  always in new disguises. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11417.48s)]
*  It was a fear that Nazism had grown into a modern system of industrial rationality geared [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11420.199999999999s)]
*  goals, a Nazism of racist superstitions, committing the same massacres of the past, a Nazism declaiming [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11426.68s)]
*  a language of democracy and freedom that had no more human content than the old-fashioned [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11433.960000000001s)]
*  rhetoric of Lebensraum and Aryan superiority. [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11438.64s)]
*  And so the new left, in its youthful anxiety, found its way to an old and mostly expired [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11442.76s)]
*  panic from its parents' generation, and they bent over it, and they fanned the dead embers [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11448.52s)]
*  and breathed on them, and watched aghast as the dying flames leapt up anew. [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11454.36s)]
*  What was new leftism then? [[03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11460.720000000001s)]
*  It was, it pictured itself as, Nazism's opposite and nemesis, the enemy of the real Nazism, [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11462.7s)]
*  the Nazism that had survived Nazism, the Nazism that was built into the foundations of Western [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11470.7s)]
*  life. [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11476.68s)]
*  Now it took some time for people to arrive at that place. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11480.6s)]
*  They rode the buses, they listened to Dr. King, they marched against the war, but nothing [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11484.36s)]
*  seemed to make the slightest bit of difference. [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11489.880000000001s)]
*  Things only seemed to be getting worse at an accelerating pace. [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11494.68s)]
*  By the time 1968 rolls around, it feels to a lot of people like the whole world is starting [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11497.640000000001s)]
*  to shake beneath their feet. [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11504.2s)]
*  Now I'm telling you, if you don't know a lot about the history, 1968 was just chaos. [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11507.48s)]
*  It's a fascinating period in American history. [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11516.039999999999s)]
*  I've been reading about it for a long time now, and you can't get enough of it. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11519.52s)]
*  It was just absolute chaos. [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11522.88s)]
*  Vietnam had spiraled completely out of control. [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11526.24s)]
*  The government had spent 1967 bombarding the American public with assurances that the Vietnamese [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11530.359999999999s)]
*  communists were on their very last legs, that things were winding down. [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11535.8s)]
*  But right away, in the first month of 1968, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong launched [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11539.56s)]
*  this massive, coordinated countrywide Tet Offensive. [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11545.119999999999s)]
*  Think about this. [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11550.359999999999s)]
*  Over the course of the entire Second Iraq War, the United States lost just over 4,400 [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11551.58s)]
*  soldiers. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11558.48s)]
*  We lost over 4,000 men in the Tet Offensive by itself. [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11559.92s)]
*  If you're old enough to remember those dark, dark days, the darkest days of Iraq back in [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11565.48s)]
*  06, 07, you turn on the news and get casualty reports every day. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11570.56s)]
*  Two more US servicemen killed in Baghdad last night. [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11576.84s)]
*  Six US soldiers killed by an IED outside Ramadi yesterday. [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11579.88s)]
*  In mid-February in Vietnam, we lost over 500 guys in one week, another 2,500 wounded, all [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11584.359999999999s)]

*  In 1968 alone, over 16,000 Americans would be killed in Vietnam, 87,000 wounded, over [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11594.96s)]
*  100,000 casualties in one year in a filthy war whose moral and political support had [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11604.16s)]
*  completely collapsed. [[03:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11611.279999999999s)]
*  And it wasn't just what Vietnam was doing to our men, it was what our men were doing [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11613.32s)]
*  to Vietnam. [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11618.72s)]
*  A month and a half after Tet, a company of soldiers would kill and rape their way through [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11620.84s)]
*  over 500 unarmed civilian men, women, and children in this little hamlet called Me Lai. [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11625.4s)]
*  I've got an episode about that. [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11630.08s)]
*  Young Americans were being dragged, kicking and screaming under threat of federal prison [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11634.16s)]
*  and sent off into a steaming jungle that they wanted nothing to do with and told to kill [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11641.2s)]
*  nasty enemy that melted in and out of the civilian population. [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11647.16s)]

*  In Vietnam, junior officers were being killed off at such a clip that the Army was putting [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11657.24s)]
*  butter bars on anybody with a college degree by that point and putting them in charge of [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11661.64s)]

*  they're just trying to survive their enlistment at this point. [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11671.26s)]
*  And so an officer who arrived with too much motivation to take it to the enemy and thereby [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11674.54s)]
*  putting his men in danger over some hill or piece of jungle that had already been taken [[03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11679.1s)]

*  getting fragged by his own guys. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11688.18s)]

*  a naked woman yet, and they were coming back addicted to heroin, struggling to sleep through [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11698.1s)]
*  the nightmares of the mangled bodies they'd seen, bodies they'd mangled themselves. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11704.7s)]

*  Morale was not even in free fall anymore. [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=11718.7s)]

*  blacks. [[03:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12780.8s)]
*  I think in our hearts what we all wanted to be, former SDS leader Kathy Wilkerson recalls, [[03:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12781.8s)]
*  was a black panther. [[03:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12788.4s)]
*  John Brown, live like him, became their rallying cry. [[03:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12790.24s)]
*  What this meant in reality was, like most protest era rhetoric, open to interpretation. [[03:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12794.44s)]
*  In the minds of apocalyptic radicals like Jacobs, white American protesters were destined [[03:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12800.4s)]
*  to become Che style guerrillas in the streets of America, rallying blacks and the white [[03:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12805.1s)]
*  working class to a bloody revolution. [[03:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12809.58s)]
*  For Jacobs and his allies, talk of violence was no longer abstract. [[03:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12812.66s)]
*  They wanted to bomb buildings and kill the policemen who were murdering blacks in the [[03:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12817.02s)]
*  ghettos. [[03:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12820.7s)]
*  End quote. [[03:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12821.7s)]
*  So the weathermen made their move in June 1969 at the SDS convention in Chicago that [[03:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12824.5s)]
*  year. [[03:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12830.54s)]
*  Two thousand people piled into the Chicago Coliseum, anticipating the coming showdown [[03:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12831.980000000001s)]
*  between progressive labor and the revolutionary youth movement of which the weathermen were [[03:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12837.02s)]
*  a contingent. [[03:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12841.34s)]
*  Burrow describes the basic difference between PL and their rivals by saying that PL adopted [[03:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12843.060000000001s)]
*  a Maoist policy of focusing on workers while the weathermen put its emphasis on the oppressed, [[03:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12848.04s)]
*  especially blacks. [[03:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12854.1s)]
*  That's an oversimplification that drowns out how culturally different the two were, but [[03:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12855.78s)]
*  it does accurately depict the showdown between an old left emphasis on doctrinaire Marxism, [[03:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12860.480000000001s)]
*  worker solidarity economics, and the new left focus on race, gender, sex, and other cultural [[03:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12866.76s)]
*  issues, although at this point it's mostly race. [[03:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12873.28s)]
*  Those other things will come over the next year, two or three. [[03:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12875.32s)]
*  Burrow writes, quote, [[03:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12878.92s)]
*  The convention's first two days were consumed with the trappings of the student-leftist [[03:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12881.560000000001s)]
*  Angry speeches, PL chants against RYM, RYM chants against PL, even fist fights. [[03:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12886.52s)]
*  The turning point came Friday night, when a delegate from the Black Panthers took the [[03:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12893.08s)]
*  microphone that condemned PL as counterrevolutionary traitors who, if their ideological positions [[03:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12897.04s)]
*  did not change, would be dealt with as such. [[03:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12903.52s)]
*  It amounted as an ultimatum from the Panthers, whose approval every SDS leader sought like [[03:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12907.4s)]
*  lost gold. [[03:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12912.24s)]
*  Not PL or else. [[03:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12913.92s)]
*  PLers tried to drown out the Panthers, chanting, read Mao and bullshit. [[03:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12916.28s)]
*  When RYM supporters chanted the Panther slogan, power to the people, PLers shouted back, power [[03:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12922.02s)]
*  to the workers. [[03:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12927.52s)]
*  Fist fights broke out. [[03:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12929.28s)]
*  On stage, Mark Rudd called for a recess. [[03:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12930.8s)]
*  As he finished, Dorn rushed to the rostrum, eyes ablaze, and shouted that it was time [[03:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12933.88s)]
*  to decide whether they could remain in the same organization as those who denied human [[03:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12938.32s)]
*  rights to the oppressed. [[03:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12942.56s)]
*  Anyone who agreed, she announced, should follow her. [[03:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12944.6s)]
*  And with that, Dorn and the leadership marched into an adjacent arena to decide what to do [[03:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12947.24s)]
*  next. [[03:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12951.68s)]
*  The RYM caucus and its allies, maybe 600 people, talked there for three hours, then resumed [[03:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12953.68s)]
*  discussions Saturday morning. [[03:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12959.28s)]
*  The debates lasted all day. [[03:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12961.64s)]
*  Finally, Dorn, pacing between a set of bleachers, delivered a slow, deliberate speech that detailed [[03:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12963.44s)]
*  the case for expelling PL from SDS. [[03:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12969.56s)]
*  We are not a caucus, she concluded. [[03:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12973.08s)]
*  We are SDS. [[03:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12975.88s)]
*  And with that, a vote was taken. [[03:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12978.16s)]
*  By a 5-1 margin, PL was expelled. [[03:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12980.4s)]
*  The leadership, led by Dorn and Bill Ayers, then drafted a statement listing the reasons [[03:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12983.72s)]
*  why. [[03:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12989.199999999999s)]
*  Around 11, everyone filed back into the main hall, and Dorn strode to the rostrum. [[03:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12990.199999999999s)]
*  For 20 minutes, she laid out every PL sin, real and imagined, terming the group reactionary, [[03:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=12996.06s)]
*  anti-communist, and objectively racist. [[03:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13001.9s)]
*  When she announced the PL's expulsion, chaos ensued. [[03:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13005.66s)]
*  PLers chanted, shame, shame! [[03:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13009.779999999999s)]
*  Dorn led the RYM caucus out of the auditorium, leading their own chants, power to the people, [[03:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13012.5s)]
*  and ho, ho, ho chi min! [[03:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13017.34s)]
*  By Sunday, confusion reigned. [[03:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13020.58s)]
*  The PLers, refusing to acknowledge their expulsion, elected their own SDS leadership. [[03:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13022.7s)]
*  At a church across town, the RYM caucus elected theirs, all prominent weathermen. [[03:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13027.5s)]
*  By Monday morning, there were, in effect, two functioning SDSs, but everyone understood [[03:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13033.62s)]
*  that weathermen had carried the day, in large part because its members had taken possession [[03:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13038.560000000001s)]
*  of the national office in the days before the convention. [[03:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13042.58s)]
*  Possession is nine-tenths of the law. [[03:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13046.5s)]
*  Weathermen possessed the national office, and so it possessed SDS. [[03:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13048.22s)]
*  But in name only, the weathermen who took control of SDS that summer envisioned an SDS [[03:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13052.82s)]
*  unlike any protest group before or since. [[03:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13058.3s)]
*  Gone was the idea of a national office as a shaggy bureaucracy to guide SDS's far-flung [[03:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13062.3s)]
*  chapters. [[03:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13067.699999999999s)]
*  In its place, the weathermen became, in effect, an uber-chapter of their own, one dedicated [[03:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13068.699999999999s)]
*  to the leadership's twin goals. [[03:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13074.859999999999s)]
*  The first was fanning out across the country to recruit members of the working class. [[03:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13077.26s)]
*  The second was melding recruits with existing weathermen for a massive protest march planned [[03:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13081.66s)]
*  for October in which the new, far larger group would make its political debut, storming the [[03:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13086.66s)]
*  streets of Chicago in an all-out attack on the police and symbols of government authority. [[03:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13092.460000000001s)]
*  They billed it as the national action, but in time it would become known as the Days [[03:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13097.78s)]
*  of Rage." [[03:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13102.34s)]
*  So soon after taking control of SDS, Bernadine Dorn leads a contingent of activists on a [[03:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13107.22s)]
*  visit to Cuba, where they were featured on magazine covers and introduced to figures [[03:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13112.939999999999s)]
*  from the international revolutionary left. [[03:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13117.539999999999s)]
*  A North Vietnamese delegation that was there at the time gave the weathermen members who [[03:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13120.099999999999s)]
*  had come to Cuba rings forged out of metal from downed U.S. aircraft and encouraged them [[03:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13125.66s)]
*  in ways that they could start a Viet Cong-style underground militia in the United States. [[03:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13131.06s)]
*  Back in the U.S., weathermen sent out 200 or so activists to rally and recruit working [[03:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13136.34s)]
*  class followers. [[03:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13141.1s)]
*  They sent them out to Seattle, Columbus, New York, Denver, Detroit, you name it. [[03:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13143.26s)]
*  So imagine a bunch of wealthy, Ivy League Jewish kids showing up to a truck stop or [[03:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13149.7s)]
*  mechanic mechanics garage in middle America somewhere, spouting Marxist jargon and denouncing [[03:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13157.74s)]
*  the U.S. as an imperialist aggressor. [[03:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13163.74s)]
*  That's what they did, and it went exactly as well as you would expect. [[03:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13166.3s)]
*  Mark Rudd tried it on a group of working class teenagers in Milwaukee, and they beat the [[03:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13171.42s)]
*  hell out of him and put him in the hospital. [[03:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13175.179999999998s)]
*  And so the weathermen invaded high schools and community colleges. [[03:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13178.259999999998s)]
*  They'd run through the halls shouting slogans and encouraging students to join the coming [[03:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13181.859999999999s)]
*  Days of Rage. [[03:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13185.619999999999s)]
*  They took over classrooms, maumauing the teachers and professors and forcing them out of the [[03:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13187.22s)]
*  class, locking the doors so that they could lecture these confused students on the horrors [[03:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13191.9s)]
*  of American racism and imperialism. [[03:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13196.98s)]
*  At a high school invasion in Pittsburgh, they threw leaflets like confetti and waved a North [[03:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13201.18s)]
*  Vietnamese flag. [[03:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13205.26s)]
*  And when that didn't work, the adult weathermen started lifting their skirts and flashing [[03:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13206.26s)]
*  their breasts at the high school boys just to keep their attention. [[03:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13209.92s)]
*  They led marches and sought out conflict with the cops. [[03:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13214.44s)]
*  They would attack police throwing bottles and rocks at them. [[03:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13219.4s)]
*  They brawled with members of the Progressive Labor Party. [[03:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13222.4s)]
*  As that summer of 69 ramped up, again this is the summer of Woodstock, as that summer [[03:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13226.92s)]
*  ramped up, weatherman morale was very high. [[03:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13233.22s)]
*  But their attempt to recruit working class people had been a complete bust, of course. [[03:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13237.08s)]
*  Several members other than Mark Rudd had been chased off or physically assaulted by the [[03:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13242.84s)]
*  oppressed working class victims they were supposed to be saving. [[03:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13247.2s)]
*  Mark Rudd had wrote his Newsweek cover and his leadership role at Columbia the previous [[03:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13253.6s)]
*  year into a kind of a default leadership position with the weathermen. [[03:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13258.04s)]
*  But as things got hot, it became clear that he was not up to that job. [[03:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13262.460000000001s)]
*  He had to engage in a lot of pretty transparent posing to prove himself. [[03:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13269.0s)]
*  An event in the fall of 69, a month before the days of rage, Mark Rudd took the stage [[03:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13273.36s)]
*  and he challenged the crowd. [[03:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13278.0s)]
*  Just a lot of overcompensating. [[03:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13279.380000000001s)]
*  He said, I've got myself a gun. [[03:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13280.380000000001s)]
*  Has anyone here got a gun? [[03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13283.2s)]
*  Anyone? [[03:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13285.400000000001s)]
*  No? [[03:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13286.400000000001s)]
*  Well, you better fucking get your shit together. [[03:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13287.400000000001s)]
*  And so a non-weatherman member of SDS, he's like, I've heard enough of this, and he jumps [[03:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13291.960000000001s)]
*  up on the stage and Mark Rudd tries to back him down. [[03:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13297.0s)]
*  He takes a few steps toward him, but the guy just runs forward and slams him into the [[03:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13300.48s)]
*  podium and Rudd just kind of shrugs and slumps off to one side of the stage to make way. [[03:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13304.16s)]
*  And that was the end of him. [[03:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13309.24s)]
*  Describing that incident, Kirkpatrick Sale wrote in his history of SDS, Rudd's face was [[03:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13312.08s)]
*  a picture of stunned fear. [[03:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13316.24s)]
*  All his rhetoric having done nothing to overcome his ingrained middle-class unfamiliarity with [[03:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13318.68s)]
*  and anxiety about violence. [[03:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13323.68s)]
*  See the weathermen, like so many of the white radical groups that came out of the universities, [[03:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13327.84s)]
*  they were insecure about their privileged origins and they really needed to borrow legitimacy [[03:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13334.460000000001s)]
*  from the oppressed groups that they were trying to represent. [[03:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13339.36s)]
*  They didn't have the moral authority to bless themselves. [[03:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13343.880000000001s)]
*  They needed the approval of the working class or the black activists, preferably. [[03:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13347.1s)]
*  You see, rejection by working class whites was something they could deal with. [[03:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13353.12s)]
*  Almost all the weathermen leaders, again, were from wealthy Jewish families. [[03:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13356.92s)]
*  And so to some degree, as far as their own self-understanding and sense of identity, [[03:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13360.48s)]
*  they were in white America, but not 100% of it. [[03:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13365.56s)]
*  There was a certain level of sort of rhetorical distance that they could take from it. [[03:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13370.56s)]
*  It wasn't that long ago that their parents or grandparents had to deal with quotas at [[03:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13376.0s)]
*  some of the same universities that they were now attending. [[03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13379.759999999998s)]
*  So it's kind of easy to feel a little bit of distance. [[03:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13382.28s)]
*  When they found white workers often unresponsive or hostile to their politics, it was a pretty [[03:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13388.880000000001s)]
*  smooth transition from the paternalism that they were proposing to a kind of contempt. [[03:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13393.52s)]
*  Most of these people hadn't spent much time around actual working class people ever in [[03:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13399.320000000002s)]
*  their lives. [[03:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13402.76s)]
*  And when they tried to, they often didn't like what they found. [[03:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13403.76s)]
*  It turned out that plumbers and bricklayers and their families tended to be patriotic [[03:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13406.88s)]
*  Americans. [[03:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13411.439999999999s)]
*  You know, they went to church, they didn't root for the North Vietnamese to win the war, [[03:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13412.439999999999s)]
*  and they didn't like communism, and they were wary of pushing the outer frontiers of the [[03:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13416.359999999999s)]
*  gender and sexual revolutions. [[03:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13421.16s)]
*  When Black Panthers got into bloody shootouts with the police, you know, these white working [[03:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13423.359999999999s)]
*  class Americans tended to support the police. [[03:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13429.039999999999s)]
*  After all, these were the people who voted Nixon into office, right? [[03:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13432.48s)]
*  They were the cops patrolling black neighborhoods and guarding southern jails. [[03:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13435.76s)]
*  They were the baby killers of Vietnam. [[03:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13440.12s)]
*  America couldn't be Nazi Germany without obedient Nazi Germans, and that was the relationship [[03:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13443.28s)]
*  that they started to take to a lot of the working class. [[03:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13447.72s)]
*  Their relationship to the Black radicals was more difficult to process. [[03:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13452.2s)]
*  If the white radicals spent much time with the Panthers, they'd have found some cultural [[03:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13456.880000000001s)]
*  gaps pretty difficult for their Ivy League sensibilities to overcome as well. [[03:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13461.28s)]
*  The Panthers tended to keep the white radicals at arm's length most of the time. [[03:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13465.480000000001s)]
*  The relative lack of close contact allowed the Panthers to remain kind of exotic and [[03:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13470.640000000001s)]
*  mysterious, but they couldn't ignore the fact or avoid realizing and admitting the fact [[03:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13475.44s)]
*  that the Panthers just did not take the white activists seriously at all. [[03:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13482.480000000001s)]
*  They thought they were soft, and that just drove the weathermen crazy. [[03:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13486.320000000002s)]
*  But they were soft. [[03:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13491.800000000001s)]
*  I mean, you have to remember, the Panthers are not a student movement. [[03:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13493.48s)]
*  There were plenty of black students who were Panthers, but the soul of the organization [[03:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13498.4s)]
*  was forged on the street. [[03:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13501.8s)]
*  They were risking their lives because their lives were already at risk, not because they [[03:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13504.199999999999s)]
*  were uncomfortable with their upper middle class privilege and looking for a little adventure. [[03:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13508.88s)]
*  The SDS National Office was set up in Chicago, located on purpose a few blocks down from [[03:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13515.32s)]
*  the Panthers' offices. [[03:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13521.24s)]
*  One SDS member who worked there at the time remembered, [[03:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13522.84s)]
*  The disrespect that they got was even worse from the adult Panthers. [[03:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13552.16s)]
*  Burrow writes, [[03:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13556.92s)]
*  The Panthers were in a state of total madness. [[03:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13582.16s)]
*  As those months went on, as they became more paranoid and more crazy, they kind of took [[03:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13585.68s)]
*  it out on us. [[03:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13590.48s)]
*  To them, our offices were much bigger, much nicer than theirs. [[03:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13592.119999999999s)]
*  We had lots of equipment and cars and the printing press. [[03:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13595.8s)]
*  It rapidly developed into this rip-off relationship. [[03:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13599.88s)]
*  That was emotionally horrible. [[03:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13603.16s)]
*  You couldn't dare question it politically. [[03:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13605.4s)]
*  It was completely insane. [[03:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13607.16s)]
*  And now back to Burrow. [[03:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13609.56s)]
*  Tensions climaxed when a group of Panthers stormed the SDS office, jammed a gun into [[03:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13611.28s)]
*  a girl's face, beat up the SDS printer, Ron Flegelman, and ransacked the office, making [[03:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13616.4s)]
*  off with typewriters and other equipment. [[03:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13621.92s)]
*  Afterward, when several weathermen went to the Panthers' offices to complain, Lerner [[03:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13624.44s)]
*  recalls, [[03:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13628.88s)]
*  We were basically kicked down the stairs. [[03:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13629.88s)]
*  End quote. [[03:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13632.8s)]
*  The white weathermen felt a constant need to prove themselves, to prove that they were [[03:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13636.0s)]
*  down for the cause and that they, and it led them to overcompensate. [[03:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13641.28s)]
*  Each one trying to out-radical the person next to them. [[03:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13645.720000000001s)]
*  And you got this left-wing extremist purity spiral that every member had the power to [[03:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13648.2s)]
*  escalate and no one had the authority to stop. [[03:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13653.6s)]
*  So by the time October comes, the weathermen are just all keyed up and ready for the days [[03:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13657.44s)]
*  of rage. [[03:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13662.52s)]
*  Panthers are giving interviews to papers around the country predicting the largest and most [[03:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13664.32s)]
*  violent protests in American history. [[03:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13668.039999999999s)]
*  Mark Rudd told a TV station that thousands and thousands were on their way to Chicago [[03:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13671.32s)]
*  to fight back, to fight the government, to fight their agents, to fight the police. [[03:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13675.68s)]
*  Weatherman leader Bill Ayers said, [[03:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13682.72s)]
*  We're not urging anybody to bring guns to Chicago. [[03:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13685.48s)]
*  We're not urging anybody to shoot from a crowd. [[03:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13689.039999999999s)]
*  We're also going to make it clear that when a pig gets iced, that's a good thing. [[03:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13692.0s)]
*  And that everyone who considers himself a revolutionary should be armed, should own [[03:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13696.439999999999s)]
*  a gun. [[03:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13700.199999999999s)]
*  So as a prelude to the apocalyptic demonstration plan for the days of rage, the weathermen [[03:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13703.199999999999s)]
*  lit off a small bomb that destroyed a 10-foot bronze statue of a policeman in Haymarket [[03:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13708.519999999999s)]
*  Square, which was the site of a labor rally, an anarchist bomb attack, which ended the [[03:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13713.439999999999s)]
*  lives of 11 people, including seven cops, back in the 1800s. [[03:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13719.640000000001s)]
*  When October 8th arrived, they were disappointed. [[03:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13724.880000000001s)]
*  Only about 200 people showed up, almost all of them existing veterans of the Weather Underground. [[03:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13729.12s)]
*  No one knew. [[03:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13734.84s)]
*  But the ones who came, they were ready for action. [[03:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13737.24s)]
*  They wore helmets and goggles and gas masks. [[03:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13739.28s)]
*  They carried pipes, chains, other weapons, and their emergency contact information. [[03:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13743.08s)]
*  Few people gave some speeches. [[03:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13750.12s)]
*  And with the battle cry, I am Marion Delgado. [[03:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13752.32s)]
*  Marion Delgado was a five-year-old boy in California. [[03:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13756.72s)]
*  In 1947, he had placed a concrete block on some train tracks to derail a train. [[03:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13760.04s)]
*  With that, they ran from Lincoln Park into the wealthy neighborhood known as Gold Coast, [[03:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13765.84s)]
*  and they began the attack. [[03:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13770.96s)]
*  Burrow writes, [[03:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13772.88s)]
*  They had assumed that the demonstration would take place inside the park. [[03:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13801.08s)]
*  Scrambling to stop the surging protesters, police managed to erect a roadblock in front [[03:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13804.96s)]
*  of the Drake Hotel. [[03:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13809.4s)]
*  Seeing it, the charging weathermen veered a block east, then ran south into another [[03:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13811.039999999999s)]
*  roadblock, this one manned by 30 helmeted police officers. [[03:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13816.32s)]
*  A melee ensued. [[03:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13820.119999999999s)]
*  30 protesters were beaten to the pavement. [[03:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13822.0s)]
*  Others broke through and split into two groups, which the police ran down, truncheon swinging, [[03:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13824.96s)]
*  and gunshots fired. [[03:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13830.04s)]
*  Six weathermen were shot, none seriously. [[03:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13831.72s)]
*  Dozens were hauled off to jail. [[03:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13834.48s)]
*  By midnight it was over." [[03:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13836.48s)]
*  So it took three days to bail everyone out of jail and reassemble their forces. [[03:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13840.76s)]
*  This time, they marched downtown, fists in the air as they hurled insults at the police [[03:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13846.78s)]
*  lining the street. [[03:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13851.28s)]
*  And at a certain point, one of the protest leaders gave a signal and they attacked the [[03:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13853.44s)]
*  police again, breaking into a run, smashing car windshields and throwing rocks, and the [[03:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13857.560000000001s)]
*  cops had had enough. [[03:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13863.2s)]
*  They were waiting for them this time. [[03:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13864.28s)]
*  They never had a chance. [[03:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13867.52s)]
*  This time, uniformed officers, augmented by plainclothes detectives, appeared at every [[03:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=13869.2s)]

*  majority popularity at any point, even as they had kicked in the door of headquarters [[04:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14417.94s)]
*  and seized control of the national offices. [[04:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14422.74s)]
*  The vast, vast majority of the student left, and I'm using that phrase to refer to the [[04:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14426.66s)]
*  left-wing younger people. [[04:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14431.66s)]
*  Some of them are out of college by this point, but they're still kind of part of the movement. [[04:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14433.78s)]
*  The vast majority are not radical communists. [[04:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14438.5s)]
*  They were anti-war, anti-racist, democratic socialists at the most. [[04:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14441.7s)]
*  Most of them weren't even that. [[04:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14447.84s)]
*  At the end of the day, most of them were just liberals. [[04:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14448.84s)]
*  But no matter how many of them there were, if you're not organized, you're not going [[04:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14452.24s)]
*  to get anything done. [[04:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14456.1s)]
*  I should make clear too. [[04:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14458.42s)]
*  I started off with the narrative talking about how a lot of young Jews were the first ones [[04:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14461.94s)]
*  to come to this worldview that led the weathermen, which were a bunch of radical Jewish activists, [[04:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14466.460000000001s)]
*  down this road that they went on. [[04:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14474.220000000001s)]
*  Just as it was true that the vast majority of the student left did not embrace anything [[04:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14475.9s)]
*  like that kind of ideology, 100% true of even the most left-wing Jewish activists as well. [[04:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14479.980000000001s)]
*  This is a very tiny contingent that, again, just like the older socialists had predicted, [[04:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14486.86s)]
*  we're going to come in here and subvert these organizations and tear them apart. [[04:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14491.980000000001s)]
*  It's a very tiny minority of these people. [[04:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14496.62s)]
*  Again, no matter how many of the liberals and democratic socialists there are, if you're [[04:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14500.460000000001s)]
*  not organized, forget about it. [[04:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14507.220000000001s)]
*  Think of the protests during the lead-up to the Iraq War. [[04:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14508.7s)]
*  Over 30 million people in 800 cities hit the streets between January and March of 2003. [[04:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14514.1s)]
*  30 million people in 800 cities in like two months, in like three months. [[04:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14522.86s)]
*  February 15, 2003, had what was probably the largest protest in world history, literally, [[04:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14529.54s)]
*  between six and 10 million people in 60 countries. [[04:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14536.26s)]
*  The New York Times writer commented that the demonstration showed that there were two superpowers [[04:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14541.54s)]
*  in the world, the United States and worldwide public opinion. [[04:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14546.38s)]
*  But that's not true. [[04:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14550.3s)]
*  Okay, six to 10 million people, 60 countries, so what? [[04:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14552.54s)]
*  What difference did they make? [[04:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14557.02s)]
*  We went to war. [[04:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14559.5s)]
*  Flash mobs are not going to accomplish anything. [[04:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14561.9s)]
*  They can create chaos, but they can't create change. [[04:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14564.42s)]
*  In fact, all they can do is open up cracks in the status quo for actual disciplined cadres [[04:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14567.06s)]
*  who are organized to squeeze in and push their own agendas, just like we saw during the Arab [[04:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14572.1s)]
*  Spring in 2011. [[04:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14576.94s)]
*  It's a perfect example. [[04:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14577.94s)]
*  The number of people who hit the streets demanding reforms from their oppressive governments [[04:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14579.94s)]
*  in the Arab Spring, they outnumbered the ones looking to use the opportunity to impose Islamist [[04:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14584.14s)]
*  rule by a long shot, by most accounts. [[04:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14589.3s)]
*  But in most places, it was the Muslim Brotherhood that were the only ones who are actually prepared [[04:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14593.34s)]
*  for the moment, actually prepared to take advantage of it. [[04:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14599.42s)]
*  And so that's where the activist left is by this point. [[04:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14605.98s)]
*  Numerous, energetic, completely disorganized, and completely lacking in coherent leadership. [[04:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14609.54s)]
*  The civil rights movement had been displaced by the Black Power movement, the socialist [[04:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14618.34s)]
*  organizations of the old left had been subverted and destroyed by radicals like P.L. and the [[04:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14622.7s)]
*  weathermen. [[04:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14628.54s)]
*  Public sympathy to the extent it had existed before had evaporated, and the authorities [[04:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14629.54s)]
*  just came in, you know, the police, they came in and tore the new left apart. [[04:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14635.94s)]
*  Easy pickings. [[04:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14641.02s)]
*  Celebrity activists from a year or two ago, like Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman, you know, [[04:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14644.02s)]
*  they were on the speaking circuit hawking new age consumer fads and exotic massage [[04:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14648.42s)]
*  techniques and telling people that politics was a dead end. [[04:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14653.94s)]
*  Which was fine for a lot of people, you know, who were using the movement therapeutically [[04:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14658.34s)]
*  anyway as a way to find themselves and create an identity. [[04:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14662.74s)]
*  But you know, it had nothing at all to say to the millions of black people who were still [[04:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14666.86s)]
*  suffering through daily life in these burned out inner cities, most of which now were infinitely [[04:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14671.1s)]
*  worse than they had ever been thanks to the riots. [[04:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14678.0s)]
*  So well-intentioned left-wing people who just wanted to voice their opposition to the war [[04:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14683.04s)]
*  or their support for black rights, they looked around and what did they see? [[04:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14687.8s)]
*  They saw a whole lot of nothing. [[04:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14692.48s)]
*  I'll come back to Berman, quote, to undo the organizational shambles that have been caused [[04:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14694.96s)]
*  by Maoism and the weather underground, to reassemble a membership organization with [[04:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14701.14s)]
*  any kind of national following among the young. [[04:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14705.76s)]
*  That was impossible. [[04:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14708.56s)]
*  It was because the madness in SDS and by then in a wide swath of the left was much too strongly [[04:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14709.56s)]
*  rooted to allow for any other outcome. [[04:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14715.86s)]
*  The new left had been founded by students who felt a revulsion for the softness of their [[04:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14718.54s)]
*  own student life. [[04:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14722.26s)]
*  And the guerrilla leap at the end of the decade was made by students who felt a revulsion [[04:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14724.22s)]
*  for the softness of their own revolt against student softness. [[04:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14728.24s)]
*  Guerrilla leftism was in that respect merely new leftism intensified. [[04:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14732.72s)]
*  It was hardened. [[04:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14737.359999999999s)]
*  It's hardened. [[04:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14738.359999999999s)]
*  In the circles of SDS, even the people who knew quite clearly that guerrilla war was [[04:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14739.359999999999s)]
*  insanity, they tended to feel that a few basic particles of the guerrilla motivation [[04:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14744.48s)]
*  remained admirable in spite of everything, which was an attitude that undid any possibility [[04:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14749.599999999999s)]
*  of arguing effectively for a more intelligent position. [[04:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14754.699999999999s)]
*  There was some of the arguments that did prove effective for merely variants of the [[04:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14758.98s)]
*  cult of the hard. [[04:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14763.66s)]
*  There was the variant of crime around the edges of the guerrilla movement in New York, [[04:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14765.26s)]
*  Cambridge, Berkeley, and a few other places where the weather underground or one of the [[04:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14769.539999999999s)]
*  other red armies enjoyed some student support. [[04:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14773.58s)]
*  A culture of criminal leftism to call it that grew up. [[04:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14776.539999999999s)]
*  Mostly it was based on a network of marijuana concessioners with a halo of utopianism above [[04:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14781.439999999999s)]
*  their long hair who could feel that crime was in the eye of the beholder. [[04:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14786.18s)]
*  Yet beyond the marijuana dealers lay a penumbra of bank frauds and shoplifting and the inevitable [[04:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14790.220000000001s)]
*  diversifications into cocaine and beyond. [[04:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14794.98s)]
*  Criminal leftism was a desperate idea, but compared to guerrilla war, it was in a certain [[04:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14798.52s)]
*  fashion a model of realism and it attracted no small number of people. [[04:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14802.92s)]
*  It had a literary side. [[04:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14807.94s)]
*  Abbie Hoffman's Steal This Book was the light classic of the movement. [[04:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14809.66s)]
*  The heavy classics were by the prison authors from the Black Panther Party, Eldridge Cleaver [[04:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14813.34s)]
*  and George Jackson. [[04:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14817.26s)]
*  And just as the books were light and heavy, the crimes too were light and heavy. [[04:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14819.58s)]
*  And among the Panthers in California and New York, and perhaps among a few other people [[04:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14823.66s)]
*  too, there were rackets and rubouts and murderous purges, all of them conducted under a haze [[04:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14827.74s)]
*  of sinister astounding slogans. [[04:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14832.86s)]
*  The fist salute and power to the people took on creepy overtones to anyone who knew what [[04:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14835.42s)]
*  was going on. [[04:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14839.82s)]
*  The other alternative was ascetic Leninism in a non-guerrilla version, which drew on [[04:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14842.5s)]
*  the same revulsion for the softness of the student world. [[04:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14847.3s)]
*  Several thousand people went in that direction, though nothing in their own impulses or in [[04:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14851.1s)]
*  the atmosphere of the moment obliged them to coordinate their many efforts. [[04:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14854.78s)]
*  And so the 1970s became the golden age of micro-parties. [[04:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14859.06s)]
*  There were Maoist sects, not only progressive labor, but also the Revolutionary Union, the [[04:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14862.54s)]
*  Communist Labor Party, Workers' Viewpoint, and some others too. [[04:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14868.779999999999s)]
*  There were the Trotskyist sects, the Socialist Workers, which dominated one wing of the National [[04:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14873.1s)]
*  Peace Movement, the Workers' World, with its Youth Against the War and Fascism, strong [[04:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14877.66s)]
*  and buffalo, the Workers' League, the Independent Socialists, the Spartacist League, plus the [[04:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14882.26s)]
*  truly small Trotskyist groups. [[04:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14888.34s)]
*  There was talent in those parties, which would have produced a powerful movement if only [[04:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14891.22s)]
*  the many militants could have figured out what to do. [[04:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14895.1s)]
*  But as Lenin and McCartney took the occasion to observe, [[04:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14897.5s)]
*  "'If you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, you ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow.'" [[04:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14901.02s)]
*  As was true of Trotsky too. [[04:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14909.140000000001s)]
*  The Communist Party enjoyed a bit of a revival itself. [[04:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14911.58s)]
*  The Communists established some influence over the West Coast Black Panthers, which [[04:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14915.18s)]
*  might have led to big results if only the Panthers hadn't been so intent on killing [[04:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14918.7s)]
*  one another. [[04:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14922.220000000001s)]
*  Angela Davis made loyalty to the party of Comrade Brezhnev seem, well, not exactly [[04:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14924.06s)]
*  fashionable but not unfashionable either. [[04:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14928.98s)]
*  And between the guerrillas, the dope dealers, the criminals and the Leninists, what chance [[04:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14932.42s)]
*  was there, really, to reassemble any kind of normal organization? [[04:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14937.06s)]
*  All kinds of people made the effort, far more than ever flirted with the hard alternatives. [[04:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14942.699999999999s)]
*  A trickle of decent souls slowly wended their way back to Michael Harrington into what eventually [[04:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14947.46s)]
*  became the Democratic Socialists of America, in an effort to pick up the old severed thread [[04:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14952.42s)]
*  of the Democratic Left. [[04:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14957.3s)]
*  Some of the community organizing enterprises managed to thrive, usually by putting away [[04:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14959.86s)]
*  their left-wing posters and slogans. [[04:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14964.58s)]
*  There were the academic radicals, who had a lot of success in the humanities departments [[04:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14967.66s)]
*  and a few other places, and there were the journalists of the weekly radical press, which [[04:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14971.460000000001s)]
*  flourished in cities around the country. [[04:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14975.5s)]
*  But there was nothing to bring those different people together, and beyond the guerrillas, [[04:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14978.32s)]
*  the outlaws, the Leninists, the Democratic Socialists, the level-headed organizers, the [[04:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14982.2s)]
*  academics and the weekly scribblers, the vast majority of people who had once felt a loyalty [[04:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14986.960000000001s)]
*  to the world that they had come out of with SDS and its fraternal organizations simply [[04:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14992.2s)]
*  slipped away. [[04:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14996.800000000001s)]
*  They took up tomato farming, or Buddhism, or the I Ching, or they threw themselves [[04:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=14998.6s)]
*  into political causes of a different sort, something post-new left. [[04:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15003.36s)]
*  Nothing remained but ashes and embers and several million people in a daze." [[04:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15007.8s)]
*  I would add one more thing to the list he provided. [[04:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15016.119999999999s)]
*  A lot of those dazed and confused people, especially out on the West Coast, ended up [[04:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15018.859999999999s)]
*  in cults. [[04:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15023.98s)]
*  A woman named Laura Cole had been a student activist in New York during the 68th student [[04:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15026.039999999999s)]
*  occupation at Columbia. [[04:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15031.42s)]
*  She had opened up her house to Black Panthers who had come to take part in the action. [[04:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15033.88s)]
*  She was hardcore, but she was very disappointed and alienated by the experience. [[04:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15037.92s)]
*  The Panthers were willing to accept help from white allies like her, but if she was looking [[04:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15043.119999999999s)]
*  for gratitude and validation from them, and she was, she wasn't going to get it. [[04:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15047.939999999999s)]
*  The Panthers at this point, they were very suspicious, even of white people who were [[04:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15053.42s)]
*  trying to help them by this point. [[04:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15057.72s)]
*  They saw right through people like her. [[04:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15060.5s)]
*  They resented how they could show up calling for violent revolution and acting all down [[04:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15062.66s)]
*  for the cause one day and then leaving for the weekend for a vacation at their parents' [[04:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15068.38s)]
*  lakeside cabin in the mountains the next day. [[04:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15073.119999999999s)]
*  The Panthers could do with or without their white allies as far as they were concerned. [[04:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15076.34s)]
*  If it wasn't for the money and connections that the white activists would bring, they'd [[04:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15079.5s)]
*  have rather done without them. [[04:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15084.1s)]
*  But the white activists really needed the Black Panthers and the other Black activists [[04:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15086.58s)]
*  to validate their existence. [[04:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15092.32s)]
*  It was a very one-sided relationship, and by this point it had gone sour. [[04:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15093.6s)]
*  So shortly after the action at Columbia, Laura Cole moved to the Bay Area and she found her [[04:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15099.6s)]
*  way into the local scene, and before long, someone told her about a radical integrationist [[04:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15104.32s)]
*  preacher giving a talk nearby and one thing led to another, and Laura Cole was a member [[04:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15109.64s)]
*  of Jim Jones People's Temple. [[04:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15114.88s)]
*  Panthers found their way into the temple for related but different reasons. [[04:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15118.88s)]
*  Berman said that when the New Left collapsed, millions of people were left wandering around [[04:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15123.759999999998s)]
*  in a daze, and he doesn't just mean figuratively. [[04:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15127.8s)]
*  The drug scene had exploded onto a population in America that really had not been prepared [[04:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15130.4s)]
*  for it. [[04:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15137.08s)]
*  There really was nothing like that before in American history. [[04:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15138.08s)]
*  A lot of very naive young people found themselves in a scene full of people who were not naive [[04:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15141.92s)]
*  at all, many of whom were unscrupulous, dangerous, or just playing crazy. [[04:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15147.800000000001s)]
*  A few years of sleeping in parks, doing drugs, will do a number on you. [[04:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15154.800000000001s)]
*  Women obviously were especially vulnerable. [[04:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15160.36s)]
*  The story of Jenny in Forrest Gump portrays it pretty well, but that was not a unique [[04:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15164.0s)]
*  story. [[04:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15169.68s)]
*  What women were going through during those years in the movement is not something that's [[04:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15172.04s)]
*  really gotten a whole lot of attention in the mainstream narrative. [[04:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15175.72s)]
*  Everyone was going around preaching free love, but of course there's an asymmetry between [[04:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15180.8s)]
*  men and women in a situation like that. [[04:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15185.96s)]
*  In practice, it often amounted to nothing more than men being able to sleep with any [[04:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15187.76s)]
*  woman they wanted to. [[04:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15191.039999999999s)]
*  The Weather Underground had something they called the Smash Monogamy Program. [[04:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15193.92s)]
*  It required all members who were in a romantic relationship to break them off in the name [[04:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15198.039999999999s)]
*  of putting aside selfish attachments in the name of group solidarity, etc., etc. [[04:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15203.960000000001s)]
*  That program also included mandatory orgies. [[04:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15209.28s)]
*  The first one took place during a visit of weather leadership in Columbus, Ohio. [[04:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15212.960000000001s)]
*  One weatherman, Gary Long, was there and he describes it, quote, [[04:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15218.08s)]
*  We were doing booze, dope, and dancing. [[04:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15223.16s)]
*  And suddenly you could see the wheels spinning in people's minds. [[04:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15226.76s)]
*  Will it happen? [[04:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15230.52s)]
*  When? [[04:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15231.52s)]
*  How to get started? [[04:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15232.52s)]
*  We knew it wouldn't happen of its own accord. [[04:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15234.28s)]
*  Somebody had to do something about it. [[04:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15236.76s)]
*  We were constantly talking about asserting leadership in ambiguous situations, and here [[04:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15238.76s)]
*  was a case in point. [[04:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15242.6s)]
*  After a while, one of the leaders went upstairs to the attic where the mattresses were with [[04:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15244.720000000001s)]
*  an old girlfriend. [[04:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15248.560000000001s)]
*  Another sees them go up and follows, taking off his clothes too and lying down beside [[04:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15250.52s)]
*  them. [[04:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15254.68s)]
*  Finally, Billy Ayers yells, it's time to do it! [[04:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15255.68s)]
*  And takes the hand of the woman he's been dancing with and goes up too. [[04:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15259.52s)]
*  Within minutes, there was a whole group of naked people looking down from the head of [[04:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15263.84s)]
*  the stairs saying, come on up. [[04:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15267.08s)]
*  I took the hand of this girl and exchanged a few pleasantries to give it a slightly personal [[04:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15269.08s)]
*  quality and then we fucked. [[04:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15273.68s)]
*  And there were people fucking and thrashing all around on the floor. [[04:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15276.960000000001s)]
*  They'd sort of roll over on you and sometimes you found yourself spread out over more than [[04:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15280.800000000001s)]
*  one person. [[04:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15284.560000000001s)]
*  The room was like some modern sculpture. [[04:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15286.0s)]
*  There'd be all these humps in a row. [[04:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15288.52s)]
*  You'd see a knee and then buttocks and then three knees and four buttocks. [[04:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15290.640000000001s)]
*  They were all moving up and down, rolling around. [[04:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15294.52s)]
*  That guy remembered that the next day there was this lingering awkwardness until one woman [[04:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15301.44s)]
*  finally blurted out, I'm sure Ho Chi Minh has them do it this way in Vietnam. [[04:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15308.2s)]
*  There's another member, John Lerner, who at the time was in the process of coming out [[04:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15314.640000000001s)]
*  as gay and he remembered those times. [[04:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15319.0s)]
*  He said quote, I was one of the people who instigated the orgies. [[04:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15321.4s)]
*  One in Chicago, I remember, after a demonstration in Washington in November. [[04:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15325.36s)]
*  Billy Ayers and I were the leaders in DC. [[04:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15329.84s)]
*  After the demonstration, about 30 of us came back to this house. [[04:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15333.2s)]
*  Somebody had a bunch of acid. [[04:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15337.08s)]
*  We sort of said, let's all drop acid and have an orgy. [[04:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15338.2s)]
*  And so we did. [[04:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15341.880000000001s)]
*  For me, it was sort of liberating because I got a chance to have sex with some of the [[04:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15343.48s)]
*  men I was after. [[04:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15347.279999999999s)]
*  The creepy thing was, I have a memory of several women who came out as lesbians having their [[04:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15348.88s)]
*  first sex with women. [[04:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15353.68s)]
*  And it was weird because everyone was sitting around watching. [[04:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15355.4s)]
*  There were people who clearly didn't want to be there standing on the sidelines, legs [[04:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15359.359999999999s)]
*  crossed. [[04:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15363.119999999999s)]
*  It was basically creepy, end quote. [[04:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15364.119999999999s)]
*  Brian Burrow actually interviewed Mark Rudd about the national orgies, as they recalled. [[04:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15367.8s)]
*  Quote, Rudd thought all the sexual experimentation, from smash monogamy to orgies to homosexuality, [[04:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15373.96s)]
*  was disastrous, fostering petty jealousies, driving people out of the collectives and [[04:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15381.359999999999s)]
*  introducing a level of sexual confusing that did little to focus cadres on the revolution. [[04:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15386.16s)]
*  Worst of all, he recalls, was a resulting epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases, [[04:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15391.759999999998s)]
*  from gonorrhea to pelvic inflammatory disease to crab lice and genital infections that [[04:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15396.8s)]
*  became so common they were called weather crud. [[04:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15401.72s)]
*  For Rudd, the final straw came when he was having sex with a woman and noticed a crab [[04:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15405.199999999999s)]
*  in her eyebrow, end quote. [[04:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15410.119999999999s)]
*  So this is not a healthy environment. [[04:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15413.88s)]
*  You've got a lot of confused young people and a lot of very vulnerable young women and [[04:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15416.439999999999s)]
*  a lot of unscrupulous and predatory men slipping around in the shadows. [[04:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15423.96s)]
*  The lines between free love and rape often became very, very blurry. [[04:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15430.0s)]
*  And even where consent did exist, the women often found themselves under different kinds [[04:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15434.919999999998s)]
*  of duress, either being manipulated by men who had been around the block many, many more [[04:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15439.8s)]
*  times than they had. [[04:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15444.519999999999s)]
*  Come on, baby, you want to be free, don't you? [[04:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15446.599999999999s)]
*  Don't let the bourgeois repression of your parents control you anymore, or else sometimes [[04:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15449.4s)]
*  they were under actually extreme social pressure in forms that wouldn't really make a lot of [[04:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15456.039999999999s)]
*  sense to us today. [[04:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15463.88s)]
*  But at the time, we're very powerful. [[04:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15464.88s)]
*  Everywhere you looked, people were engaging in these Red Guard style all night struggle [[04:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15467.8s)]
*  sessions. [[04:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15473.359999999999s)]
*  They'd call them struggle sessions, criticism, self-criticism sessions, the people's temple [[04:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15474.359999999999s)]
*  when they started doing, called them catharsis sessions. [[04:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15479.08s)]
*  It was basically the group would just take turns singling out members for abuse, supposedly [[04:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15481.4s)]
*  to help them break through ego blockages and strengthen collective solidarity. [[04:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15487.32s)]
*  But in reality, it always just devolved into the stronger personalities emotionally abusing [[04:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15491.08s)]
*  the weaker ones. [[04:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15496.08s)]
*  You can see videos and stuff from these different organizations, and it is ugly stuff. [[04:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15497.08s)]
*  You see whole groups of people just screaming like wild-eyed rabid baboons on some poor [[04:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15504.2s)]
*  soul in the middle, threatening and insulting them for some real or imagined shortcoming. [[04:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15510.0s)]
*  It looks exactly like an extremely emotionally abusive one-on-one relationship just scaled [[04:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15517.08s)]
*  up. [[04:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15522.44s)]
*  And often in these free love environments, men would use these struggle sessions to break [[04:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15524.480000000001s)]
*  women down emotionally. [[04:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15529.0s)]
*  Martialing the rest of the group to their side, you know, if the women were too selfish [[04:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15531.48s)]
*  or repressed to have sex with them. [[04:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15534.96s)]
*  By the end of the 1960s, millions and millions of young people are just in bad shape. [[04:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15537.92s)]
*  You're strung out on drugs, either addicted or just coming off of addiction. [[04:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15545.119999999999s)]
*  Women who have been passed around and used and very often, very, very often physically [[04:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15550.619999999999s)]
*  abused. [[04:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15557.0s)]
*  Lots of them with unplanned children and the rolling stone of a father long gone, or often [[04:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15558.72s)]
*  even worse, still around. [[04:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15564.88s)]
*  That scene in Forrest Gump where Forrest sees Jenny's boyfriend smack her around in the [[04:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15566.64s)]
*  panther den, that's not just a random scene for the story. [[04:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15570.84s)]
*  That's playing on what used to be a well-known dark side of the hippie and new left scenes. [[04:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15574.08s)]
*  A bunch of drug-addled, overly emotional men beating the hell out of their women. [[04:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15579.119999999999s)]
*  There's a reason that the feminist movement took on a new dimension of militancy in the [[04:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15584.64s)]
*  1970s coming right out of this. [[04:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15588.08s)]
*  So besides people like Laura Cole looking around for some place to put their activist [[04:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15592.199999999999s)]
*  energies, you just had a lot of people who were at their wits end looking for some kind [[04:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15596.679999999998s)]
*  of stability and structure. [[04:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15602.0s)]
*  Many were coming from lives that lacked anything like structure since long before the 60s ever [[04:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15605.16s)]
*  got a hold of them. [[04:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15609.4s)]
*  Vern Gosney was a gay man who'd grown up in an abusive conservative family with an [[04:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15611.4s)]
*  alcoholic mother. [[04:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15615.76s)]
*  He joined people's temple. [[04:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15617.64s)]
*  As a teenager he would walk the streets of San Francisco getting picked up by older men. [[04:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15619.92s)]
*  When he was 19 though he met a woman named Cheryl, a heavyset black woman. [[04:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15624.32s)]
*  Vern Gosney was shy, skinny, and even though he was gay, he was pretty confused at the [[04:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15631.96s)]
*  time, still young. [[04:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15638.199999999999s)]
*  And when he met Cheryl he said, here's this woman who's a survivor from Harlem, who's [[04:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15639.2s)]
*  strong, dignified, who's the warrior goddess. [[04:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15643.76s)]
*  I mean, if you walked down the street with Cheryl, no one would fuck with you. [[04:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15647.0s)]
*  No one man or woman. [[04:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15651.52s)]
*  Nobody. [[04:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15653.240000000002s)]
*  She was that strong. [[04:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15654.240000000002s)]
*  And I fell in love with her. [[04:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15656.28s)]
*  I was not necessarily oriented towards all the women in the world. [[04:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15658.08s)]
*  I was in love with Cheryl. [[04:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15661.6s)]
*  Well, his family disowned him for marrying a black woman. [[04:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15664.72s)]
*  His father told him that their children would look like gorillas and his mother simply never [[04:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15669.72s)]
*  spoke to him again. [[04:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15673.34s)]
*  That couple, they found people's temple right at a time where they couldn't rent an apartment [[04:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15676.24s)]
*  anywhere because nobody would rent to an interracial couple. [[04:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15680.88s)]
*  And to them, people's temple, when they found it, it seemed like a dream. [[04:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15684.679999999998s)]
*  A lot of people and groups talked racial harmony. [[04:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15690.240000000002s)]
*  It was not talking in people's temple. [[04:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15693.84s)]
*  It was the real deal. [[04:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15695.84s)]
*  And so they were accepted in a way that they had never experienced. [[04:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15698.28s)]
*  They'd never really even imagine possible. [[04:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15702.320000000002s)]
*  Vern Gosney bounced in and out of the church. [[04:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15708.0s)]
*  He was a drug user and that wasn't allowed at the temple. [[04:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15710.78s)]
*  So he would kind of go in and out. [[04:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15713.68s)]
*  And during one of their periods away from the church, Cheryl became pregnant with their [[04:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15715.76s)]
*  son Mark. [[04:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15719.8s)]
*  When it was time to give birth, she was in the hospital and the doctor gave her too much [[04:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15720.8s)]
*  anesthesia. [[04:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15725.64s)]
*  The baby was delivered in a C-section, but Cheryl went into a coma and never woke up. [[04:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15727.8s)]
*  And so Vern Gosney took the hospital to court, but the doctor said that he couldn't tell [[04:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15732.4s)]
*  that Cheryl was losing oxygen because she was too black and the jury bought that excuse. [[04:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15739.0s)]
*  And so after that, he went back to the temple and he stayed there until the final day. [[04:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15744.52s)]
*  Gary Lambrov, the first temple recruit in California that I quoted earlier, he was another [[04:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15751.68s)]
*  gay man, very well-educated guy. [[04:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15757.44s)]
*  And he was a left-wing organizer and activist before he ever ran into people's temple. [[04:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15760.6s)]
*  He'd been arrested for jumping the fence of the Oakland Naval Supply Depot during an anti-war [[04:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15766.4s)]
*  protest. [[04:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15770.36s)]
*  He was coming out of this left-wing student world that I've spent some time describing. [[04:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15771.36s)]
*  He dropped out of his PhD program at Stanford and he was living in Ukiah when he found himself [[04:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15781.960000000001s)]
*  at a temple gathering. [[04:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15786.960000000001s)]
*  He was a guy, obviously left-wing gay, who found Ukiah's conservative community pretty [[04:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15789.28s)]
*  stifling. [[04:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15796.36s)]
*  Some people had moved to town who were interested in racial justice like he was. [[04:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15798.36s)]
*  Years later, that first night, he still remembered it vividly. [[04:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15804.400000000001s)]
*  I was extremely shy and felt incredibly awkward, but I went with them. [[04:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15809.16s)]
*  I remember arriving at this shack, basically a two-room home, and maybe 40 or 50 people [[04:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15814.0s)]
*  were gathered around a wood stove in the middle of the room. [[04:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15819.26s)]
*  The room was lit by the stove and some kerosene lamps, so there were as many shadows as there [[04:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15823.12s)]
*  were lights. [[04:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15827.32s)]
*  The adults were sort of clinging to the sides and the young people were dancing to soul [[04:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15829.52s)]
*  and rock and roll. [[04:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15833.32s)]
*  I mean, the rhythm was pounding. [[04:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15834.32s)]
*  Aretha Franklin, a lot of black soul, the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, and feeling self-conscious [[04:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15836.32s)]
*  and not wanting to dance, I just sort of faded into the wall. [[04:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15842.84s)]
*  Where I faded into the wall on my left was a man who seemed to be somewhere in his mid-30s, [[04:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15846.88s)]
*  height, considerably sturdier than I am and somewhat swarthier. [[04:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15853.24s)]
*  We got into this conversation very easily that went from the most mundane to the most [[04:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15857.48s)]
*  esoteric and most profound, and hop, skipped, and jumped throughout the universes in the [[04:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15861.44s)]
*  most extraordinary conversation I had ever had with another human being, or ever since [[04:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15866.92s)]
*  had with another human being. [[04:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15872.199999999999s)]
*  Finally, I sort of broke through and said, excuse me, I didn't get your name. [[04:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15873.8s)]
*  I'm Gary. [[04:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15878.24s)]
*  He said, oh, I'm Jim. [[04:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15879.96s)]
*  And I said, oh, you're Jim Jones? [[04:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15882.76s)]
*  He said, yeah, I'm really glad to meet you. [[04:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15886.0s)]
*  And it was a sort of genius that I saw repeated many, many times over the years in which Jim [[04:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15889.199999999999s)]
*  knew precisely how to approach any new person in terms of their own world, their own reality, [[04:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15894.36s)]
*  and even in terms of their own language, end quote. [[04:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15899.84s)]
*  That gives you some idea, some kind of an idea of Jim's gift. [[04:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15903.0s)]
*  Lambrev is a very intelligent man. [[04:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15909.0s)]
*  He'd had a master's degree from Stanford, and he'd been working under a Woodrow Wilson [[04:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15911.08s)]
*  scholarship getting his PhD there. [[04:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15915.439999999999s)]
*  He's a poet and a writer. [[04:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15918.279999999999s)]
*  He's been around a lot of other people like himself, more educated than himself. [[04:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15919.96s)]
*  But Jim Jones, this young preacher just arrived from the Midwest, approaches him out of nowhere, [[04:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15924.24s)]
*  and to this day, Gary Lambrev remembers it as the most extraordinary conversation he's [[04:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15930.279999999999s)]
*  ever had before or since. [[04:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15935.78s)]
*  Gary Lambrev and Vern Gosney, they were also drawn in by the fact that they were not just [[04:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15939.380000000001s)]
*  accepted by everyone as gay men, but it was real acceptance. [[04:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15943.140000000001s)]
*  Just like the racial harmony was not an affectation. [[04:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15948.460000000001s)]
*  It didn't require effort from the people. [[04:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15950.900000000001s)]
*  There was nothing fake about it. [[04:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15952.78s)]
*  It was real, and it was natural to them. [[04:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15954.220000000001s)]
*  Race, sexual orientation, this is 50 years ago. [[04:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15957.34s)]
*  And in people's temple, that stuff did not matter. [[04:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15962.62s)]
*  If you're someone like Vern Gosney, with his background, never feeling comfortable [[04:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15967.62s)]
*  or accepted anywhere, and only getting anything like acceptance when you're around other people [[04:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15972.660000000002s)]
*  like yourself, which since they couldn't be in public were often seedy environments, it [[04:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15978.28s)]
*  was an absolute revelation to find these people. [[04:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15984.5s)]
*  These kind, wholesome people who went to church and had kids, and you could be yourself and [[04:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15988.060000000001s)]
*  be accepted around them. [[04:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15993.9s)]
*  Many other people began finding their way into people's temple after 1968. [[04:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=15998.300000000001s)]
*  A lot of them were also educated, young white leftists like Gary Lambrev, and they were [[04:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16002.380000000001s)]
*  making their way into the temple from the Bay Area activist scene. [[04:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16007.58s)]
*  People who had enough of the drugs and the free love, and who didn't find the imposed [[04:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16012.56s)]
*  discipline and exceedingly straight lifestyle in the temple to be a drawback, it was something [[04:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16018.199999999999s)]
*  that attracted them at this point. [[04:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16022.539999999999s)]
*  They'd had enough of the other side. [[04:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16024.279999999999s)]
*  Dick Trapp was one, and he jotted down his story just shortly before taking his life [[04:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16028.64s)]
*  on people's temple's final day. [[04:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16034.8s)]
*  He wrote, quote, [[04:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16036.88s)]
*  I started out in Bedford-Stu-Visant, grandson of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, [[04:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16040.119999999999s)]
*  studied cello from age nine, went to University of Rochester where I majored in English and [[04:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16046.0s)]
*  comparative literature, graduated with highest honors, went to Europe on a travel scholarship, [[04:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16050.76s)]
*  tried to pursue academic route at Berkeley, 1965-66 on a Wilson fellowship. [[04:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16057.88s)]
*  I was supposed to go to the top of my field, but somehow I had a profound dissatisfaction [[04:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16063.6s)]
*  with it all. [[04:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16068.48s)]
*  I had been experimenting with psychedelic drugs and had drifted into the hip culture [[04:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16069.48s)]
*  of Berkeley. [[04:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16073.72s)]
*  I lived on several communes. [[04:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16074.72s)]
*  I was a participant in civil rights demonstrations and marches, and by the mid-60s I was attracted [[04:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16077.359999999999s)]
*  to revolutionary ideas. [[04:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16082.0s)]
*  Then I met Jim Jones. [[04:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16084.64s)]
*  To be brief, I have found a place to serve, to be, and to grow. [[04:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16087.56s)]
*  To learn the riddle of my own insignificance, to help build a future in the shadow of the [[04:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16093.6s)]
*  apocalypse under which I felt I was always living. [[04:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16098.32s)]
*  I look back on the past as if to another world, a dead and dying world. [[04:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16102.08s)]
*  A new center of gravity has been established in my life, and to my great, great relief [[04:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16107.279999999999s)]
*  and happiness that new center of gravity is not me." [[04:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16113.16s)]
*  I would encourage you not to discount the power of that sentiment he voiced at the very [[04:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16119.88s)]
*  end there, of having found a new center of gravity for his life other than himself. [[04:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16125.279999999999s)]
*  It's not merely the lifting of a burden, although it is that. [[04:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16130.599999999999s)]
*  A lot of religions in one form or another are about the neuroses and hang-ups that are [[04:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16134.199999999999s)]
*  the natural result of having a self at the center of each one of our universes, and to [[04:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16140.199999999999s)]
*  feel free of those, if only in passing, it can be a profound and intoxicating experience. [[04:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16144.599999999999s)]
*  It changes people. [[04:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16150.759999999998s)]
*  Think about the feeling of being in love, of really being in love, where every thought [[04:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16154.12s)]
*  is of the other person, and the center of your world has shifted from yourself to the [[04:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16159.720000000001s)]
*  object of your love and your relationship to that object. [[04:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16165.0s)]
*  Take that same intense feeling and put it into a different context, where it's not coming [[04:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16169.58s)]
*  from being in love, but from a social experience with many people. [[04:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16175.76s)]
*  You can watch video of people's temple services that really cannot ever do them justice, because [[04:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16180.88s)]
*  what the video can't capture is how these people weren't just having a good time, walking [[04:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16187.96s)]
*  out after a meeting, big smiles, wow, that was great. [[04:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16194.0s)]
*  That's just the background music. [[04:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16198.08s)]
*  These people were sharing that intense experience comparable to being in love, except their [[04:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16201.439999999999s)]
*  center of gravity hadn't shifted from themselves to some love object, but to each other and [[04:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16206.96s)]
*  to this movement and to the people they were serving and to their pastor, Jim Jones, who [[04:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16212.32s)]
*  had made all this happen, who worked longer and harder than any of them every day, and [[04:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16217.919999999998s)]
*  together they were feeding and housing and healing people. [[04:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16223.72s)]
*  There was something special happening, something important, more important than just their [[04:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16228.48s)]
*  cherry work. [[04:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16233.92s)]
*  They had come upon a new way of living, a better way, and it felt like enlightenment [[04:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16234.92s)]
*  to these people, or it felt like that feeling of being in love, or in any case of being [[04:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16241.6s)]
*  a part of something very, very, very meaningful. [[04:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16246.48s)]
*  When they came together in these services, as they're dancing and singing and listening [[04:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16252.0s)]
*  to Jim, they could look around and look each other in the eye, men and women and white [[04:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16259.4s)]
*  people and black people of all different backgrounds and classes at a time when everything around [[04:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16263.76s)]
*  them is just tearing itself apart with hatred and violence and riots. [[04:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16269.44s)]
*  These people from all these different backgrounds, different races, everything, they could look [[04:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16275.76s)]
*  at each other and share this knowing, meaningful look of, we are part of something very, very [[04:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16279.6s)]
*  special here. [[04:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16286.08s)]
*  There's something going on here. [[04:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16287.16s)]
*  That's how you explain somebody following Jim Jones to California, against the wishes [[04:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16291.44s)]
*  of their family and friends who all think they're crazy, or how you explain some good [[04:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16296.0s)]
*  people rationalizing some increasingly insane behavior as time goes on, because even after [[04:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16301.48s)]
*  that significant feeling begins to become rarer and rarer, when it seems to have gone [[04:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16307.8s)]
*  away completely, this was the only place that they had ever found it. [[04:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16314.0s)]
*  And they just, they knew it had to be in there somewhere. [[04:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16318.92s)]
*  That's how Jack Palladino, who's a private investigator who was hired to the legal team [[04:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16323.04s)]
*  of one of the survivors of The Last Day put it, quote, Jones gave people joy. [[04:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16327.0s)]
*  And you can't put a price tag on that. [[04:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16332.16s)]
*  That's why they stayed. [[04:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16335.2s)]
*  Because no matter how bad it got, they were still holding out that they could find that [[04:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16336.960000000001s)]
*  joy. [[04:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16340.68s)]
*  They could find that ecstasy. [[04:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16341.68s)]
*  They could have that memory of that period of that time and that spark, the ecstasy, [[04:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16343.44s)]
*  that joy back. [[04:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16350.52s)]
*  And that's why they stayed. [[04:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16352.2s)]
*  That's why they held to the end, end quote. [[04:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16353.24s)]
*  When these new people started joining the temple starting in 1968, they transformed [[04:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16357.04s)]
*  it. [[04:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16363.6s)]
*  Coming out of this new left milieu, they were politically radical in ways that the Indiana [[04:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16364.6s)]
*  temple hadn't really been much exposed to. [[04:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16369.16s)]
*  But just as significantly, they were educated and professional people, many of them, who [[04:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16373.199999999999s)]
*  brought skills and connections that opened up whole new worlds of possibility. [[04:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16377.88s)]
*  These weren't people finishing up their GED like many of the church leaders from Indiana. [[04:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16382.72s)]
*  Like I said, Gary Lambrov was in a PhD program at Stanford. [[04:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16386.96s)]
*  There's a lot of educated people coming out of these Bay Area left-wing movements into [[04:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16390.239999999998s)]
*  the church. [[04:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16396.88s)]
*  And they really transformed what was possible. [[04:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16398.16s)]
*  In Indiana, Jim and his people had gotten by on determination and elbow grease. [[04:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16400.96s)]
*  And they'd accomplished a lot opening two old folks' homes, running their free restaurant [[04:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16405.199999999997s)]
*  and job placement programs. [[04:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16410.719999999998s)]
*  Everything they'd done out there was amazing. [[04:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16412.16s)]
*  But there's only so much that this ragtag bunch of blue collar folks with high school [[04:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16413.719999999998s)]
*  educations or less could do by themselves. [[04:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16418.44s)]
*  To do the kind of things that they were doing at the scale that Jim Jones saw, you needed [[04:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16421.48s)]
*  organizational management skills. [[04:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16429.52s)]
*  You needed some ability to navigate the Byzantine worlds of nonprofit, legal, and tax policy, [[04:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16431.36s)]
*  financial management, licensing and regulation, stuff that was totally opaque to the folks [[04:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16437.4s)]
*  coming out of Indiana. [[04:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16442.600000000002s)]
*  That all changed starting in 1968, when this whole new layer of membership was added to [[04:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16445.08s)]
*  the movement. [[04:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16449.8s)]
*  The single most important addition was a young lawyer named Tim Stone. [[04:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16451.48s)]
*  Early in his late 20s, Tim Stone was a man who had everything going for him. [[04:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16457.04s)]
*  He was successful. [[04:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16461.56s)]
*  He was well-educated. [[04:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16462.56s)]
*  He was popular, ambitious. [[04:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16463.56s)]
*  He often took a few hours away from his private law practice during the day to go volunteer [[04:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16466.68s)]
*  or attend anti-war demonstrations in San Francisco. [[04:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16470.72s)]
*  But when they were over, he drove his Porsche back to his nice, well-appointed Berkeley [[04:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16473.56s)]
*  apartment. [[04:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16478.16s)]
*  He'd been raised, well-raised by middle-class parents in Colorado. [[04:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16479.16s)]
*  They'd instilled in him a basic ethical sensibility and a very solid work ethic. [[04:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16484.28s)]
*  He was a Christian man. [[04:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16490.879999999997s)]
*  He took his faith seriously, but he was not a fundamentalist. [[04:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16491.879999999997s)]
*  He considered himself a liberal. [[04:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16496.16s)]
*  Tim Stone did, but he was no militant. [[04:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16498.239999999998s)]
*  In fact, he hoped to run for Congress one day as a liberal Republican. [[04:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16501.039999999997s)]
*  To that end, he had plans to put a Stanford Law degree to work in the district attorney's [[04:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16506.12s)]
*  office. [[04:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16510.399999999998s)]
*  He'd already had experience in the public sector before starting out in the Mendocino [[04:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16512.4s)]

*  As he started to see the temple in action, he's becoming more and more impressed by their [[04:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16553.44s)]
*  dedication and especially by their affection for one another. [[04:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16556.8s)]
*  He's very drawn to it. [[04:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16560.559999999998s)]
*  He's especially overwhelmed by what he's seeing in the character of their leader, Jim Jones. [[04:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16563.2s)]
*  It was obvious that the people adored and looked up to Jim, but one day while he was [[04:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16570.96s)]
*  looking for Jim in the Ukiah Church building, Tim found Jim in the bathroom, sleeves rolled [[04:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16575.600000000002s)]
*  up, scrubbing a toilet, just like he was no different from anyone else in the temple. [[04:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16580.8s)]
*  It just blew Tim away, kind of sold him on in a little detail. [[04:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16584.68s)]
*  Then he found Jim conversant in current events, more conversant than he was on many subjects. [[04:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16590.280000000002s)]
*  Jim impressed him with his ideas about social justice activism kind of being the core of [[04:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16596.0s)]
*  the Christian message. [[04:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16600.2s)]
*  Tim Stone began to send people that he met in his legal aid work to the church for counseling [[04:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16603.480000000003s)]
*  or for help getting off drugs. [[04:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16607.68s)]
*  Consistently, he was amazed with how the people responded. [[04:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16610.08s)]
*  Tim Stone became a dedicated member. [[04:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16615.120000000003s)]
*  He would make the drive from Berkeley up to Ukiah for services. [[04:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16618.04s)]
*  He would also offer his expertise and his energy to help put Jim's ambitious vision [[04:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16620.96s)]
*  for the temple, for its future, help him put it into action. [[04:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16626.64s)]
*  Tim wasn't put off by the faith healings, which were not the focus of the ministry in [[04:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16633.04s)]
*  Ukiah anyway. [[04:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16637.72s)]
*  They weren't really a big part of it. [[04:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16638.72s)]
*  In any case, this was the 60s in California. [[04:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16640.92s)]
*  There were new age gurus and secular enlightenment fads popping up with fantastic claims on every [[04:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16644.239999999998s)]
*  corner. [[04:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16650.399999999998s)]
*  So Jim Jones' faith healings were hardly the strangest thing to be found. [[04:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16651.399999999998s)]
*  Tim Stone wasn't really too worried about that. [[04:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16656.879999999997s)]
*  In fact, pretty soon he accepted it like everybody else. [[04:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16660.199999999997s)]
*  When Telegraph Avenue and People's Park turned into war zones in Berkeley toward the end [[04:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16664.32s)]
*  of 1969, Tim's politics got more serious and his work with the church became more and more [[04:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16668.28s)]
*  the focus of his life after that. [[04:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16673.879999999997s)]
*  At the time, Tim had a girlfriend. [[04:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16676.12s)]
*  Her name was Grace. [[04:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16680.36s)]
*  Grace was much younger than Tim, 18. [[04:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16682.12s)]
*  He was 29 when they met in 69. [[04:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16684.079999999998s)]
*  Her background was very different from Tim's as well. [[04:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16688.039999999997s)]
*  Grace was a pretty girl of Mexican descent from a roughish neighborhood in San Francisco. [[04:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16691.0s)]
*  Not a ghetto, but say lower working class. [[04:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16696.88s)]
*  She found Tim's attempts to impress her with his Porsche and his other things, she found [[04:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16703.68s)]
*  that to be a bit much. [[04:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16709.280000000002s)]
*  She rolled her eyes a bit when Tim would drive her down Telegraph in Berkeley, pointing out, [[04:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16710.620000000003s)]
*  this is the place where I buy my crystal. [[04:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16715.2s)]
*  Those are the places where I shop for clothes and so forth. [[04:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16717.72s)]
*  She thought that was a little corny. [[04:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16721.0s)]
*  Part of it was maybe that she was put off. [[04:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16723.56s)]
*  Part of it was that she could see through it. [[04:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16725.52s)]
*  She lacked Tim's worldliness. [[04:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16728.74s)]
*  When he took her to visit Berkeley's campus, it was the first time she'd ever been there, [[04:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16730.8s)]
*  even though she'd grown up just across the bridge. [[04:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16734.16s)]
*  She had street smarts and a more grounded common sense that Tim did not have. [[04:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16737.44s)]
*  He was sweet and he was kind and she did like him. [[04:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16744.36s)]
*  He was very smart and interesting. [[04:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16746.8s)]
*  Before long, they were in a relationship and he got her to check out People's Temple with [[04:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16748.44s)]
*  him. [[04:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16752.16s)]
*  Well, Grace's natural skepticism and ability to kind of see people who were trying to blow [[04:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16753.72s)]
*  smoke at her, it shaped her first experience with the temple. [[04:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16759.4s)]
*  From the first time she met Jim Jones, she didn't like him. [[04:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16763.6s)]
*  There's just something a little bit too slick about him for Grace and she was put off by [[04:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16766.079999999998s)]
*  the way everyone treated him like he was the second coming. [[04:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16771.2s)]
*  She didn't buy into the healings or the prophecies and she was shocked that somebody like Tim [[04:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16775.1s)]
*  would buy into it. [[04:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16778.88s)]
*  She disliked how Jim constantly was just haranguing his congregation for donations throughout [[04:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16780.44s)]
*  the service. [[04:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16785.8s)]
*  The offering plate didn't just get passed around once, not twice, just again and again. [[04:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16786.8s)]
*  Jim would play on every single angle, just every single card he had he would play to [[04:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16791.76s)]
*  get money out of people. [[04:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16795.84s)]
*  The temple needed money to build a bomb shelter to protect from imminent nuclear war. [[04:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16797.32s)]
*  Children were starving in third world countries while the congregation ate three meals a day [[04:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16802.68s)]
*  and how dare you? [[04:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16806.12s)]
*  Not political parties are funded by rich people while positive social organizations [[04:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16808.4s)]
*  like the temple rely on donations from regular people. [[04:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16813.24s)]
*  Tithing showed evidence of faith that would ensure that they'd be protected from car accidents [[04:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16817.640000000003s)]
*  and house fires and cancer, whatever it took. [[04:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16821.72s)]
*  Jim would play on whatever worked on individuals. [[04:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16824.800000000003s)]
*  The money all seemed to be going toward good work. [[04:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16829.920000000002s)]
*  Grace had to admit that. [[04:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16832.640000000003s)]
*  Jim wore secondhand clothing. [[04:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16834.0s)]
*  He lived modestly with old used furniture. [[04:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16836.04s)]
*  He drove around a beat up car, but she just didn't like it. [[04:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16840.16s)]
*  She didn't hate Jim. [[04:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16843.8s)]
*  She just wasn't drawn in by the whole thing the way a lot of people were. [[04:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16845.46s)]
*  She had the reaction that probably most of us would have if we walked into a situation [[04:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16849.36s)]
*  like this. [[04:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16853.04s)]
*  From the moment we got there, all these doe-eyed people who just seem a little too friendly [[04:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16854.280000000002s)]
*  and too welcoming for our taste, they're not just saying, you should really meet our pastor. [[04:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16859.58s)]
*  He's a good man. [[04:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16865.16s)]
*  I think you'd really like him, but he's amazing. [[04:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16866.16s)]
*  He's the greatest, most loving man in the world. [[04:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16869.4s)]
*  Then he comes out. [[04:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16873.6s)]
*  Although it's true that he is very dedicated to social justice causes and is kind and he [[04:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16875.72s)]
*  does work hard for people, he has the air of someone who's used to everyone around him [[04:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16880.84s)]
*  treating him that way. [[04:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16886.6s)]
*  Grace was put off by that. [[04:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16888.36s)]
*  She liked him. [[04:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16890.68s)]
*  Jim loved Jim Jones. [[04:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16892.320000000003s)]
*  Although she always reserved a place in the back of her mind to remember where the exits [[04:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16894.280000000002s)]
*  were, she visited that place less and less and slowly, Grace Stone became a part of the [[04:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16899.280000000002s)]
*  Temple family too. [[04:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16903.88s)]
*  It's not easy for me to understand what happens to someone like Tim Stone. [[04:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16907.68s)]
*  My personality has always been constructed in a way that I kind of resist authority. [[04:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16912.440000000002s)]
*  I'm a lot more like Grace in being somewhat repulsed when I see people sucking up and [[04:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16917.480000000003s)]
*  showering adulation on another person. [[04:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16922.960000000003s)]
*  It might be a generational difference. [[04:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16926.2s)]
*  The people we're talking about in this story are boomers. [[04:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16928.24s)]
*  These young white people who at the time were coming in from the Bay Area, they're mostly [[04:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16932.32s)]
*  boomers. [[04:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16936.280000000002s)]
*  This is the generation of people who fainted when they saw the Beatles, literally fainted, [[04:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16937.280000000002s)]
*  and who had a sort of generational religious streak that sent droves of them off to India [[04:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16943.44s)]
*  to seek enlightenment or following gurus in the United States. [[04:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16948.359999999997s)]
*  I was a latchkey kid born in 1981, so right on the edge of where Gen X kind of tips over [[04:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16951.8s)]
*  toward millennial, but I've always had that Gen X tendency to take a certain kind of automatic [[04:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16957.359999999997s)]
*  ironic distance from things. [[04:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16964.039999999997s)]
*  A natural suspicion of too much certainty, difficulty committing myself too completely [[04:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16966.879999999997s)]
*  to any ideology or party or religious sensibility. [[04:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16972.82s)]
*  That's why Gen X will probably have the shortest run holding leadership positions in the United [[04:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16977.579999999998s)]
*  States. [[04:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16981.18s)]
*  Boomers held down the fort longer than normal because Gen X just hadn't been that interested [[04:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16982.94s)]
*  or maybe not self-confident enough to take it away from them. [[04:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16987.7s)]
*  Once Gen X inherits things by default, millennials who are a lot more like boomers in this way [[04:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16991.54s)]
*  will probably take things over a lot earlier than otherwise, and Gen X will have to just [[04:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=16996.54s)]
*  move on. [[04:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17001.18s)]
*  And so maybe that has something to do with it. [[04:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17002.18s)]
*  Or maybe it's just me, but try as I might, I find it difficult to get into the head of [[04:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17004.38s)]
*  someone like Tim Stone. [[04:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17008.94s)]
*  It took some doing, but Tim convinced Grace to move with him up to Ukiah, and by January [[04:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17012.22s)]
*  1970, he had sold his Porsche and quit his private practice and was ready to devote himself [[04:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17018.46s)]
*  body and soul full-time to People's Temple. [[04:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17024.46s)]
*  He'd sold his Porsche and given the money to the church. [[04:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17028.739999999998s)]
*  But as he began to get ready to pack his things and move, he had some questions, and so he [[04:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17033.02s)]
*  wrote a letter to Jim Jones, and I'm going to read the letter to you. [[04:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17038.46s)]
*  Quote, [[04:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17041.82s)]
*  Dear Jim, Mike Cartmell, one of the Indiana members, suggested I write and formally ask [[04:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17042.82s)]
*  certain questions in my mind as I plan to move to Ukiah. [[04:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17050.78s)]
*  First, what factors should one employ in purchasing a car? [[04:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17054.3s)]
*  New versus old, big versus small, American versus foreign? [[04:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17058.34s)]
*  Second, what factors in buying clothes? [[04:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17062.82s)]
*  Third, what type of furniture? [[04:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17065.899999999998s)]
*  Should it be sturdy but as unpretentious as possible, or is it okay to have nice furniture [[04:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17068.34s)]
*  if it's shared? [[04:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17073.219999999998s)]
*  Fourth, what about possessions like books and records? [[04:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17074.899999999998s)]
*  An expensive stereo system, expensive paintings, art books? [[04:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17078.46s)]
*  What do I do with them? [[04:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17082.3s)]
*  Fifth, is it best for us to completely refrain from alcohol, including a glass of wine before [[04:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17083.7s)]
*  bed? [[04:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17088.98s)]
*  Is it harmful to an anti-materialist lifestyle for us to go to nightclubs? [[04:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17089.98s)]
*  I hope you won't be offended by these questions, Jim, for I know the mere fact that I ask them [[04:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17095.74s)]
*  shows how important these aspects of materiality are to me. [[04:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17100.38s)]
*  I have, however, decided to live up to the standards of the communal Christian church [[04:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17104.14s)]
*  as set forth in the Acts of the Apostles. [[04:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17108.74s)]
*  To donate everything I have, I can no longer be the same person seeking power and pleasure [[04:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17111.42s)]
*  as I have blueprinted myself to be. [[04:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17116.76s)]
*  Sincerely, Tim Stone. [[04:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17119.339999999997s)]
*  P.S. In your opinion, could I do more good for the church by becoming Assistant District [[04:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17121.739999999998s)]
*  Attorney Civil or by becoming Directing Attorney of Legal Services? [[04:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17127.26s)]
*  Please advise. [[04:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17132.1s)]
*  End quote. [[04:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17133.1s)]
*  This is a grown man. [[04:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17134.1s)]
*  Jim Jones is just a couple years older than he is, and he's asking Jim to tell him how [[04:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17139.02s)]
*  he should dress himself, what kind of furniture he and Grace are allowed to have in their [[04:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17143.78s)]
*  home, whether he can keep his stereo and books and records, and if it's okay to take Grace [[04:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17148.5s)]
*  out to a nightclub every once in a while. [[04:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17154.3s)]
*  He's asking Jim to decide what job he should take and whether he and Grace are allowed [[04:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17157.94s)]
*  to have a glass of wine before bedtime. [[04:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17162.38s)]
*  You know, actually, maybe it's not as off the walls of making it out. [[04:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17166.14s)]
*  People join the military knowing that they're going to be told what time to get out of bed, [[04:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17169.86s)]
*  what to wear, what to eat, and how they spend most of their time. [[04:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17173.92s)]
*  You know, priests join the church knowing they're not allowed to have romantic relationships. [[04:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17177.5s)]
*  So maybe Tim thought of it like that. [[04:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17183.66s)]
*  But there's something about it that feels different when, instead of joining an institution [[04:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17186.82s)]
*  with rules and regulations that govern certain aspects of everybody's lives, you're submitting [[04:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17191.22s)]
*  yourself to an organization that is very difficult to distinguish from the individual man at [[04:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17196.420000000002s)]
*  the top of it, and whose rules and regulations are impossible to distinguish from that individual [[04:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17202.06s)]
*  man's whims. [[04:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17207.620000000003s)]
*  Regardless of how powerful or popular he is, no pope is synonymous with the church. [[04:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17211.38s)]
*  It's reserved for Christ himself to say, I am the head and the church is the body. [[04:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17217.84s)]
*  But People's Temple was an extension of Jim Jones. [[04:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17221.88s)]
*  Its actions flowed from his will. [[04:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17227.52s)]
*  You serve the temple when you serve Jim Jones, and you serve Jim when you serve the temple. [[04:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17231.48s)]
*  And so it just feels different. [[04:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17238.16s)]
*  Tim and Grace got married by Jim Jones. [[04:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17242.4s)]
*  They were married by Jim Jones later that year. [[04:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17244.52s)]
*  They took a one-night honeymoon because Tim was eager to get back to work for the temple. [[04:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17247.4s)]
*  They rented a little house in Ukiah where they were allowed certain material luxuries [[04:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17252.02s)]
*  that were frowned on by the rest of the temple. [[04:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17255.72s)]
*  It was an exception that Jim justified by the fact that at Tim's job at the district [[04:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17257.960000000003s)]
*  attorney's office, he would be required to present a certain image. [[04:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17261.980000000003s)]
*  And so they got settled in. [[04:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17268.32s)]
*  Grace enjoyed playing lady of the house. [[04:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17269.84s)]
*  And when they had free time together, Tim would read to her left-wing political tracks [[04:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17271.88s)]
*  by Eldridge Cleaver and Paul Ehrlich. [[04:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17275.48s)]
*  But free time soon became harder and harder to come by. [[04:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17278.44s)]
*  Tim was a zealot, fully committed to his work for the church and for Jim Jones. [[04:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17281.48s)]
*  At Jim's request, he set up a temple legal clinic to provide free services to the poor. [[04:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17287.92s)]
*  He met with Jim regularly to discuss legal matters and provide guidance dealing with [[04:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17292.88s)]
*  church matters. [[04:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17298.28s)]
*  Jim spoke to him with a frankness that he didn't speak to anybody else in the church [[04:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17299.28s)]
*  with that kind of frankness, very directly, almost as an equal, not quite, but almost. [[04:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17305.6s)]
*  Jim Jones knew how important Tim was going to be to his ambitions. [[04:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17311.8s)]
*  And he made sure that everybody worked hard to keep Tim happy and engaged. [[04:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17315.399999999998s)]
*  When Jim required Tim Stone to write an essay expressing his feelings about socialism, Tim [[04:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17322.76s)]
*  put it like this, quote, Until two months ago, socialism was for me a very unnerving [[04:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17328.52s)]
*  word. [[04:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17335.12s)]
*  So imbued am I by the rotary luncheon speeches praising free enterprise and condemning socialism [[04:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17336.16s)]
*  as mutually exclusive and slavery invoking that it's been the greatest deterrent to a [[04:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17341.04s)]
*  full acceptance of the values held by people's temple. [[04:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17345.28s)]
*  But a socialist sees the individual as existing on behalf of the community. [[04:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17348.24s)]
*  He is not an elitist. [[04:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17353.28s)]
*  Economically, he resents the accumulation of money into the hands of an unresponsive [[04:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17354.92s)]
*  elite capitalists. [[04:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17359.48s)]
*  The socialist wants the means of production nationalized. [[04:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17361.76s)]
*  He wants the wealth of the country redistributed so that everyone has his basic needs met, [[04:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17365.3s)]
*  end quote. [[04:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17370.64s)]
*  Pretty straightforward. [[04:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17372.399999999998s)]
*  Well, as a church passed 300 members by the end of 1969, Jim Jones starts directing his [[04:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17373.399999999998s)]
*  people to do more things. [[04:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17381.059999999998s)]
*  He has them open up a rest home for the elderly as they had in Indiana. [[04:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17382.2s)]
*  They open up a drug rehab center. [[04:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17385.8s)]
*  Tim Stone, he used his connections and expertise to shepherd the legal work that was necessary [[04:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17388.48s)]
*  through the system. [[04:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17395.760000000002s)]
*  He was made the chairman of the church board and his dual roles church attorney in Mendocino [[04:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17397.940000000002s)]
*  County District Attorney Assistant District Attorney gave the church a nice, clean, shiny [[04:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17401.600000000002s)]
*  face to show to the community. [[04:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17406.52s)]
*  And he came into daily contact with the most powerful people in the county. [[04:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17408.8s)]
*  The district attorney, judges, the newspaper editor and journalists, police and school [[04:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17411.92s)]
*  officials, agency heads. [[04:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17417.679999999997s)]
*  Jim Jones could not have asked for a better person to come in and just be ready to fully [[04:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17421.76s)]
*  devote himself, especially considering that Tim Stone's oath to his public job was secondary [[04:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17425.399999999998s)]
*  to his loyalty to the temple. [[04:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17431.239999999998s)]
*  And he did not hesitate to share information from the district attorney's office with Jim [[04:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17432.879999999997s)]
*  Jones or to use his access to help the church. [[04:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17436.679999999997s)]
*  Sometimes his zeal would get the better of him. [[04:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17442.120000000003s)]
*  You know, and he would forget where he was. [[04:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17443.52s)]
*  He would talk about the temple to anyone who would listen at work, at the grocery store, [[04:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17444.960000000003s)]
*  walking down the street, anywhere. [[04:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17449.120000000003s)]
*  If he could find somebody's ear, he would talk about it. [[04:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17452.0s)]
*  He would sing the praises of the temple and Jim Jones himself. [[04:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17453.920000000002s)]
*  People who knew and respected Tim from his from his work, they found his relationship [[04:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17457.960000000003s)]
*  to the temple very confusing. [[04:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17462.440000000002s)]
*  You know, in 1971, one time he would try to tell the county welfare supervisor that Jim [[04:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17464.84s)]
*  Jones had healed himself instantly after being shot. [[04:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17469.48s)]
*  And when the supervisor balked at the story, Tim offered himself as an eyewitness. [[04:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17473.0s)]
*  He said, Jim took the bullet and held it up and dropped it and it went plank. [[04:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17477.0s)]
*  And so the supervisor sarcastically is like, Tim, it went plank. [[04:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17482.72s)]
*  It's strange thing to hear from somebody who's an assistant district attorney. [[04:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17489.0s)]
*  One time at a Republican Party political event, Tim was still involved at that time. [[04:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17493.96s)]
*  Party officials said, Tim, it sounds like you think Jim Jones is God. [[04:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17499.64s)]
*  And Tim just said, well, I guess I think he is. [[04:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17503.84s)]
*  Another time at a meeting with the County Board of Supervisors, Tim's secretary comes [[04:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17508.0s)]
*  in and hands him a note that says Jim Jones needs you. [[04:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17513.4s)]
*  He gets up at the Board of Supervisors meeting, just walks out without even bothering to explain [[04:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17516.48s)]
*  why. [[04:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17521.68s)]
*  He comes back the next day and one of the supervisors asked him what happened. [[04:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17522.68s)]
*  He said, can't talk about it. [[04:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17527.4s)]
*  I took this job on the condition that if anything came up, you know, my work for the church [[04:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17529.4s)]
*  comes first. [[04:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17533.52s)]
*  And that was it. [[04:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17535.0s)]
*  He had become a fully committed servant of People's Temple and he was fanatically loyal [[04:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17537.760000000002s)]
*  personally to Jim Jones. [[04:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17543.16s)]
*  Between work and serving the church, Tim had no personal time of his own. [[04:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17546.52s)]
*  He woke up at 4 a.m. to study history and politics at Jim's recommendation. [[04:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17550.36s)]
*  Every minute of his day was scheduled with meetings and phone calls and his calendar [[04:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17555.2s)]
*  even had minutes blocked out for the times that he would eat, sleep, shower, shave. [[04:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17559.24s)]
*  It was just one thing after another. [[04:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17564.56s)]
*  And the one thing that did not make its way into Tim's schedule very often and increasingly [[04:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17566.72s)]
*  less often was his new wife, Grace. [[04:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17573.84s)]
*  And so with people like this surrounding Jim Jones, especially given that, again, many [[04:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17577.2s)]
*  of them are young women coming into the temple from environments where free love was kind [[04:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17583.2s)]
*  of the rule. [[04:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17588.96s)]
*  What happened next was probably inevitable. [[04:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17590.52s)]
*  I mean, look, let's just be honest. [[04:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17594.28s)]
*  How long would most men go if day in, day out, they were surrounded by many attractive [[04:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17597.32s)]
*  women who worshiped you to a point where any attention you give them, anything at all made [[04:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17604.579999999998s)]
*  them lightheaded? [[04:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17611.0s)]
*  You know, where all you had to do any time you wanted was walk up and say, do this, and [[04:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17613.04s)]
*  they would not only do it, but they would feel like they'd been given a gift. [[04:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17618.440000000002s)]
*  How many men are built to deal with a situation like that? [[04:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17623.16s)]
*  Really? [[04:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17626.72s)]
*  Maybe you don't take advantage at first. [[04:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17629.14s)]
*  Maybe you don't take advantage for a long time. [[04:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17631.3s)]
*  But how long does a big bowl of candy have to sit on your table with your name on it [[04:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17633.52s)]
*  before you start coming up with reasons why maybe this one little bite won't hurt anybody? [[04:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17638.980000000003s)]
*  You know, you can be good for a week, a month, a year, but all it takes is one moment of [[04:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17646.38s)]
*  weakness. [[04:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17652.100000000002s)]
*  And after that, I mean, who in that situation only does it once? [[04:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17653.100000000002s)]
*  There's a reason that damn near every single cult leader you have ever heard about from [[04:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17659.86s)]
*  Munster to Jonestown ends up sleeping with his followers. [[04:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17664.26s)]
*  Psychiatrists have to be trained on how to deal with the transference issues of patients [[04:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17669.14s)]
*  who fall in love with them because it happens so often. [[04:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17672.3s)]
*  You're the one with the control. [[04:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17675.379999999997s)]
*  You're the one with the answers. [[04:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17676.62s)]
*  In this situation, you're the most popular guy in high school. [[04:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17680.14s)]
*  The boss and the object of transference all rolled into one. [[04:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17684.179999999997s)]
*  And in Jim's case, he's the living embodiment of love and compassion and understanding and [[04:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17688.019999999997s)]
*  every other human value that his followers cherish. [[04:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17693.22s)]
*  And it's not like it's one sight. [[04:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17698.18s)]
*  It's not like, you know, you're just cold calling these ladies out of the blue. [[04:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17699.600000000002s)]
*  They know what they're doing, too. [[04:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17703.06s)]
*  And Jim Jones is just a guy from Indiana at the end of the day. [[04:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17704.5s)]
*  He's just a guy. [[04:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17707.34s)]
*  And very often it was not necessarily Jim Jones doing all the manipulating. [[04:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17709.22s)]
*  And to be fair to Jim, it didn't start out this way. [[04:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17713.620000000003s)]
*  You know, there's no evidence that he had any extramarital affairs during the years [[04:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17717.420000000002s)]
*  in Indiana. [[04:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17721.22s)]
*  His first in California, it wasn't until after they'd been there for four years, and it wasn't [[04:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17723.1s)]
*  on impulse. [[04:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17728.14s)]
*  At the time, his wife, Marceline, she was having some health issues, issues she had [[04:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17729.14s)]
*  for a long time, actually, including severe lower back problems that required frequent [[04:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17736.78s)]
*  therapy. [[04:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17740.7s)]
*  And by the late 60s, that was limiting their sex life to almost nothing. [[04:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17742.06s)]
*  Marceline would often sleep in a separate bed because any movement by Jim at night was [[04:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17746.86s)]
*  just completely intolerable. [[04:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17750.82s)]
*  And she kept awake all night. [[04:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17752.54s)]
*  And so that and the 24-7 schedule he kept up for his pastoral duties and overseeing [[04:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17755.62s)]
*  the church's growing operations had caused the two to grow more distant from each other. [[04:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17760.42s)]
*  And you know, they were still respectful, but it was just they were becoming more distant, [[04:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17765.26s)]
*  certainly more distant than this flock of newcomers that were trying to impress him [[04:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17771.26s)]
*  and competing for his attention at every single moment. [[04:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17774.739999999998s)]
*  And yet still, his first affair was not with something that happened. [[04:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17778.620000000003s)]
*  You know, it wasn't something that happened on impulse. [[04:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17783.02s)]
*  It was not with some young pretty church member that he got bored with not long afterward. [[04:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17785.7s)]
*  The first woman that Jim turned his attention to in his whole life after Marceline, it was [[04:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17791.660000000003s)]
*  only the second woman he'd ever been with, was named Carolyn Layton. [[04:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17798.620000000003s)]
*  And she was a lean brunette who had joined the church with her husband, Larry Layton. [[04:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17802.300000000003s)]
*  The best way I can think of to describe her is that she looks like olive oil from the [[04:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17806.98s)]
*  old Popeye cartoons. [[04:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17810.579999999998s)]
*  So Larry, her husband, you know, he had been a shy and retiring child. [[04:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17813.22s)]
*  And although he had found something of an identity in the student left, he was a drug [[04:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17817.3s)]
*  user and a loafer. [[04:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17822.1s)]
*  And he just he lacked energy and ambition, kind of stereotypical of his sort of privileged [[04:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17823.899999999998s)]
*  upbringing. [[04:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17829.22s)]
*  Carolyn was not that way. [[04:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17830.899999999998s)]
*  She was a serious woman raised by liberal Methodist parents who had practically groomed [[04:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17831.899999999998s)]
*  her for work in the People's Temple. [[04:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17836.22s)]
*  On the Sunday after she and her sister Annie ended their lives in the mass suicide, her [[04:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17839.58s)]
*  father, who was a preacher himself, gave a sermon that spent a few moments, just a few [[04:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17843.460000000003s)]
*  moments eulogizing his two dead daughters. [[04:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17850.66s)]
*  And the whole rest of the sermon, he was basically just delivering a political lecture that would [[04:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17853.74s)]
*  not have been out of place coming from the pulpit of People's Temple. [[04:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17857.780000000002s)]
*  So that was the kind of home she'd come from. [[04:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17860.420000000002s)]
*  Carolyn and Larry Layton, they really provide a window into the structure of temple society [[04:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17864.78s)]
*  in certain ways. [[04:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17869.699999999997s)]
*  They were both archetypes of the kind of men and women who would end up forming the leadership [[04:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17870.699999999997s)]
*  circle. [[04:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17874.379999999997s)]
*  Larry Layton was slavishly devoted to Jim Jones. [[04:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17876.219999999998s)]
*  Jim didn't even bother hiding that he was having sex with Caroline. [[04:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17880.66s)]
*  And when he decided it was time, he simply told Larry that you're going to have to divorce [[04:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17884.42s)]
*  Carolyn and get out of the way. [[04:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17888.239999999998s)]
*  And as a consolation prize later on, Jim would arrange for Larry Layton to remarry to one [[04:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17890.94s)]
*  of the most beautiful women in the church. [[04:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17895.18s)]
*  But before long, Jim decided to just take his turn with her as well, and he cuckolded [[04:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17897.26s)]
*  Larry again. [[04:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17901.059999999998s)]
*  But nothing Jim could ever do would break Larry's dog-like loyalty. [[04:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17902.18s)]
*  It often seemed like Jim was trying to see how far he could push that. [[04:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17907.899999999998s)]
*  Over the years, he humiliated Larry Layton almost as a sport. [[04:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17911.079999999998s)]
*  Almost as if, as his own power and control within the temple grew, he was curious, how [[04:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17916.22s)]
*  far can I push this? [[04:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17921.5s)]
*  The most dedicated and devoted of my followers, how far can I push them before something in [[04:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17923.440000000002s)]
*  them has to revolt? [[04:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17928.4s)]
*  There was no revolt in Larry Layton. [[04:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17930.800000000003s)]
*  This is a pathetic man. [[04:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17933.280000000002s)]
*  Walked over and held in contempt, even by people who considered loyalty to Jim to be [[04:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17935.74s)]
*  a primary virtue. [[04:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17939.940000000002s)]
*  Of course he was looked on by contempt with Jim himself. [[04:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17942.54s)]
*  By the end, in Jonestown, when Jim crazed and strung out on amphetamines and barbiturates [[04:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17945.9s)]
*  and holding all night ranting lectures and struggle sessions in the jungle, he's up [[04:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17954.420000000002s)]
*  there slurring his words and waving a gun around as he screams about the CIA's plots [[04:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17959.300000000003s)]
*  to kill him and threatening torture and worse to anybody who tries to escape. [[04:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17963.620000000003s)]
*  Larry Layton would stand at the edge of the stage with a cup and he would hold it out [[04:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17968.46s)]
*  when Jim needed a place to take a piss and he didn't want to leave the microphone. [[04:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17973.18s)]
*  That's what kind of man Larry Layton was. [[04:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17977.62s)]
*  As time goes on, that's more and more what he's the extreme version, but that's what [[04:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17980.18s)]
*  a lot of the men are like in the temple. [[04:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17984.46s)]
*  Carolyn was not like that. [[04:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17988.5s)]
*  She became very devoted to Jim Jones. [[04:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17991.739999999998s)]
*  By all accounts, the two were in love with each other, for real. [[04:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17994.7s)]
*  But even at the beginning, it took some time for her to warm up to Jim. [[04:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=17999.38s)]
*  This was not the case with most of the other women over the years, but it was the case [[05:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18004.34s)]
*  with Carolyn Layton. [[05:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18008.22s)]
*  Almost uniquely in the temple, she would question Jim in public, she would let him know when [[05:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18010.940000000002s)]
*  she thought he was wrong, and Jim would take it. [[05:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18014.62s)]
*  Jim would take it from her, which was also almost unique. [[05:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18017.46s)]
*  He wouldn't take it from anybody else. [[05:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18019.9s)]
*  Carolyn's privileged position isolated her, made her a subject of resentment to the other [[05:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18023.06s)]
*  women especially, but along with Tim Stone, she held as much authority in the church as [[05:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18028.5s)]
*  anyone besides Jim himself. [[05:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18033.18s)]
*  As far as the day-to-day operations, Marceline, mother, as church members would come to call [[05:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18035.940000000002s)]
*  her, she would always command a level of respect almost co-equal with Jim, especially with [[05:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18040.98s)]
*  all the people who come from Indiana, but her role was more ceremonial, not administrative. [[05:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18046.58s)]
*  She was the queen, and Carolyn was kind of the prime minister. [[05:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18053.3s)]
*  And so it was Carolyn who actually exercised more real decision-making authority on a regular basis. [[05:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18057.82s)]
*  Carolyn was an extreme ideologue, a left-wing hardcore extremist, and she got more and more [[05:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18065.3s)]
*  so over the years. [[05:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18073.62s)]
*  One of the real political fanatics in the temple. [[05:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18076.06s)]
*  She'd been a high school teacher before devoting herself to people's temple. [[05:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18080.7s)]
*  A solid enough job, but one that she had kind of settled for among the more limited opportunities [[05:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18083.420000000002s)]
*  that were available to women 50 years ago, just as she had settled for Larry Layton as [[05:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18088.3s)]
*  her husband. [[05:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18093.22s)]
*  And my own suspicion, I haven't been able to find anything direct that substantiates [[05:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18094.72s)]
*  this, but just after having read and listened to just about everything out there, and a [[05:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18098.62s)]
*  lot of it having to do with these two's relationship. [[05:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18104.78s)]
*  My suspicion is that Jim saw a bit of his mother in Carolyn. [[05:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18108.66s)]
*  His mother was a smart, ambitious woman who'd had to settle for Jim's useless, layabout [[05:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18113.46s)]
*  father during the Great Depression. [[05:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18119.22s)]
*  Carolyn was smarter, stronger, more ambitious, and more assertive in every way than Larry [[05:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18122.74s)]
*  Layton, who, like Jim's father, was as harmless as he was useless, and that was how his mother [[05:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18128.22s)]
*  was related to Jim's own father. [[05:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18134.22s)]
*  Both Carolyn and Jim's mother had had to put aside their ambitions to take up regular [[05:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18137.22s)]
*  jobs and make ends meet, and to both Carolyn and his mother, Jim was kind of the means [[05:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18140.9s)]
*  by which both of them might finally see and do the great things that they'd originally [[05:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18149.5s)]
*  dreamed about. [[05:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18153.780000000002s)]
*  Both women, to other people, seemed frigid and blunt and kind of closed off, but both [[05:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18156.780000000002s)]
*  of them were completely open with Jim Jones, and only with Jim Jones in a way that they [[05:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18162.780000000002s)]
*  would never be to anyone else. [[05:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18167.38s)]
*  I think part of Jim's years-long abuse and humiliation of Larry Layton, it had to have [[05:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18170.100000000002s)]
*  been a form of belated, indirect torture of the memory of his hated father, as well as [[05:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18177.100000000002s)]
*  just Carolyn is his woman now, and he wants to torture her ex-husband. [[05:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18184.420000000002s)]
*  I can't prove it, but I can practically hear Jim and his mom in some private conversation, [[05:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18189.54s)]
*  one that wasn't recorded and put down in the Jonestown archives, and Jim telling her that [[05:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18194.98s)]
*  Carolyn reminds me of you, Mom, and his mom also getting a little bit of perverse pleasure [[05:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18199.7s)]
*  out of seeing her son ritually humiliate a guy who's standing in for the man that she [[05:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18205.0s)]
*  too had always held in cold contempt. [[05:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18209.86s)]
*  Jim Jones and Carolyn Layton would be together until the very end, and she would become, [[05:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18215.660000000003s)]
*  for all practical purposes, like a second wife to him, and a second mother to his children [[05:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18220.9s)]
*  also. [[05:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18224.5s)]
*  When the family would take vacations, Jim would schedule them for two weeks. [[05:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18225.5s)]
*  One week for him, his children, Marceline, the other week for him, the kids, and Carolyn. [[05:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18229.34s)]
*  Of course, that was very hard on Marceline. [[05:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18234.620000000003s)]
*  His oldest son, Stephen, his biological son, with Marceline, hated his father for betraying [[05:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18237.820000000003s)]
*  his mother, and he never really forgave him for that, but over the years even he got used [[05:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18243.66s)]
*  to Carolyn. [[05:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18247.7s)]
*  At the end, in the death tape, which you'll hear in a future episode, this is the tape [[05:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18250.059999999998s)]
*  recording of people's temples last hour or so on Earth, it'll be Carolyn that you'll [[05:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18256.28s)]
*  hear matter-of-factly standing up and instructing the assembled multitude to form up in lines [[05:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18262.1s)]
*  to receive their cup of cyanide-laced Kool-Aid from the vat. [[05:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18267.539999999997s)]
*  Outside the temple, she'd been a high school teacher grinding out lessons for disinterested [[05:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18274.38s)]
*  kids. [[05:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18278.38s)]
*  Inside, she was one of the most powerful administrators and chief ideologues of a revolutionary movement [[05:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18279.38s)]
*  with thousands of members and millions of dollars in operations and friends and enemies [[05:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18284.58s)]
*  in the U.S. government. [[05:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18289.5s)]
*  As far as she was concerned, a mission to politically transform the world. [[05:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18290.5s)]
*  She was quite serious about that. [[05:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18297.62s)]
*  As long as Carolyn was able to exercise power within the temple and was secure in her position [[05:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18299.78s)]
*  as Jim Jones first, she didn't really mind so much when other women in the church began [[05:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18305.1s)]
*  requiring his special attention. [[05:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18310.699999999997s)]
*  Once he'd broken the seal with Carolyn, Jim's sexual energy kind of flowed freely and the [[05:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18312.94s)]
*  attractive young women from that California group began lining up for a close experience [[05:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18317.539999999997s)]
*  of Father's love. [[05:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18323.82s)]
*  Because he and the organization were one, people's temple members jockeyed for position [[05:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18326.7s)]
*  within the church hierarchy by competing to be close to Jim Jones. [[05:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18333.7s)]
*  Jim's sexual partners obviously had an inside track. [[05:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18339.219999999998s)]
*  To be one of his partners was an automatic ticket into the church aristocracy and the [[05:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18342.219999999998s)]
*  women knew this. [[05:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18346.02s)]
*  It wasn't as if they were just surprised and shocked beyond everything one day when Jim [[05:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18347.02s)]
*  made a move. [[05:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18352.079999999998s)]
*  It was usually as the culmination of a process in which they were taking part and they went [[05:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18353.86s)]
*  away pleased that they'd finally made it. [[05:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18358.320000000003s)]
*  Often hoping against hope that Jim's feelings for them were unique. [[05:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18362.160000000003s)]
*  When each one, other than Carolyn, inevitably found out that she was just going to be one [[05:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18365.5s)]
*  among many, she was disappointed. [[05:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18370.820000000003s)]
*  In every case, Jim's the man. [[05:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18372.600000000002s)]
*  Jim knows what he's doing. [[05:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18375.800000000003s)]
*  In every case, she would take it out on her competitors and not on Jim. [[05:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18376.800000000003s)]
*  This had the effect of ensuring that the women closest to Jim, who were eventually really [[05:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18383.04s)]
*  running most of the church's day-to-day operations, they remained rivals with one another. [[05:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18388.280000000002s)]
*  They distrusted each other. [[05:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18392.800000000003s)]
*  They often worked to undermine one another, which made it very easy for Jim to manipulate [[05:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18394.56s)]
*  and play them off each other. [[05:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18399.4s)]
*  Over time, again, more and more of the church's activities came to be managed by these women. [[05:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18402.2s)]
*  That was how the church ended up being structured to the point that people's temple has sometimes [[05:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18407.120000000003s)]
*  been described by people who studied it as a matriarchy that was ruled on a day-to-day [[05:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18412.04s)]
*  basis by Jim's close inner circle of ultra-loyal, politically super radical white female sex [[05:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18416.24s)]
*  partners. [[05:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18423.64s)]
*  Jim would show up and preach. [[05:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18426.440000000002s)]
*  He'd be the man. [[05:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18428.8s)]
*  He'd be the guy on stage that everybody would be focusing on. [[05:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18429.8s)]
*  He'd maybe have the ideas, go build this, go do that. [[05:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18433.600000000002s)]
*  On a day-to-day basis, this inner circle of Jim's women were really the ones who were [[05:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18437.56s)]
*  running the church and taking it in the direction that they wanted it to go. [[05:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18441.960000000003s)]
*  Jim always framed his liaisons with the temple women. [[05:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18449.800000000003s)]
*  It was an act of compassion for him. [[05:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18452.760000000002s)]
*  It was really a distraction from his more important work, but it was necessary to help [[05:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18454.36s)]
*  these women relate to the movement in a more personal way. [[05:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18459.52s)]
*  Jim Jones never did anything for himself, you see. [[05:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18463.52s)]
*  But he was willing to give the women what they needed in a spirit of self-sacrifice. [[05:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18466.12s)]
*  Strangely enough, of course, the women who seemed to need such special attention always [[05:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18473.12s)]
*  seemed to be young, attractive, and white. [[05:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18478.8s)]
*  But they weren't always women. [[05:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18482.039999999997s)]
*  Jim also sometimes had sex with his male followers, always maintaining the dominant position and [[05:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18483.719999999998s)]
*  always telling them it was only for their own good. [[05:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18490.079999999998s)]
*  Jim would teach his people that all men in the world other than himself were actually [[05:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18494.44s)]
*  homosexuals and that despite his distaste for anal sex, he was willing to perform it [[05:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18498.199999999997s)]
*  on them in order to show them the truth about themselves. [[05:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18504.039999999997s)]
*  Many of the young men who joined the church, they wandered in in a vulnerable and confused [[05:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18508.48s)]
*  state of mind as well. [[05:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18514.12s)]
*  Some had been living lives of self-destructive chaos until Jim Jones pulled them out of it. [[05:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18516.68s)]
*  Men who had negative reactions to the idea of sex with Jim Jones were then accused by [[05:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18523.6s)]
*  everybody else of being repressed and homophobic, which were two cardinal sins in the church, [[05:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18528.84s)]
*  and the men were very eager to disprove that about themselves. [[05:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18533.96s)]
*  Other people just believed truly that Jim Jones was this special being with magical [[05:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18537.92s)]
*  powers and they submitted to him because of that. [[05:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18542.0s)]
*  One man, Tim Carter, he had been in Vietnam and he describes a time when he was in the [[05:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18546.199999999997s)]
*  jungle in Vietnam when he had a mystical experience that sounds like something you'd read in a [[05:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18552.76s)]
*  bargain bin, a new age book. [[05:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18559.0s)]
*  He says that he suddenly ceased to be and he became light. [[05:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18561.5s)]
*  He became everything in the universe and everything in the universe became him. [[05:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18565.879999999997s)]
*  There was no me. [[05:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18569.42s)]
*  He says there was no me. [[05:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18570.42s)]
*  It just was. [[05:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18573.039999999997s)]
*  Okay, you know, fine. [[05:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18574.039999999997s)]
*  Many of us have had good mushrooms. [[05:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18576.26s)]
*  So he gets back to the US from Vietnam and he's sort of drifting around, intermittently [[05:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18579.0s)]
*  homeless. [[05:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18584.84s)]
*  He hates America, hates the politicians and the rich for putting him and so many others [[05:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18586.12s)]
*  through the hell of Vietnam. [[05:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18591.239999999998s)]
*  And so after the shootings at Kent State, he buys a hunting knife and he goes down to [[05:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18593.719999999998s)]
*  City Hall in San Francisco with the intention to cause some kind of mayhem. [[05:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18597.16s)]
*  But suddenly he says, a voice spoke to him and told him that violence could not change [[05:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18601.14s)]
*  the world. [[05:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18606.16s)]
*  No spirit can do that. [[05:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18607.52s)]
*  And so he left off the knife attack and soon enough comes across an article in a newspaper [[05:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18609.12s)]
*  about a miracle working preacher named Jim Jones. [[05:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18614.0s)]
*  When he finally made it to his service, it's as if Jim Jones is speaking directly to him. [[05:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18618.04s)]
*  In a sermon from the time that Carter joined, this was just a bit later than the other events [[05:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18623.72s)]
*  I'm describing when Jim was more openly strident in public about this stuff, Jim thunders from [[05:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18628.32s)]
*  quote, America's got a false sense of security. [[05:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18634.359999999997s)]
*  She's too fat, too content. [[05:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18638.239999999998s)]
*  She's too materialist and the bombs never hit her shores. [[05:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18640.28s)]
*  That's why we push our big guns all over the country and all over the world. [[05:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18643.92s)]
*  The commander of your United States Marines says there's nothing but dirty dollar grubbing [[05:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18647.719999999998s)]
*  capitalistic fingers in Vietnam. [[05:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18652.0s)]
*  We were never there to bring freedom. [[05:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18655.179999999997s)]
*  We were never there to protect those people from communism. [[05:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18657.0s)]
*  He said, I've been a baron, a robber on three continents for US Steel, Standard Oil. [[05:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18660.1s)]
*  Walter Cronkite showed you just the day before yesterday, the entire terror of what we're [[05:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18666.859999999997s)]
*  doing. [[05:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18670.579999999998s)]
*  Showed a school, showed an orphanage, showed a hospital that had been bombed to powder. [[05:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18671.579999999998s)]
*  And if you don't give it of yourself and discipline yourself, you're a murderer. [[05:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18676.379999999997s)]
*  You're a traitor and you're worse than all the killers making the napalm because you [[05:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18680.46s)]
*  know better. [[05:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18683.98s)]
*  End quote. [[05:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18685.3s)]
*  And then suddenly Jim does address Tim Carter directly. [[05:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18687.82s)]
*  As a donation plate is being passed around, it comes to him and he reaches into his pocket [[05:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18694.84s)]
*  and puts what he's got into the plate. [[05:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18699.5s)]
*  He leans over to his sister who's there with him and says, well, that's my last 67 cents, [[05:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18702.079999999998s)]
*  so I hope you've got money for cigarettes. [[05:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18707.079999999998s)]
*  And then a short time later, Jim's up there giving his sermon from the stage and he points [[05:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18710.02s)]
*  up to the balcony where Tim Carter and his sister are sitting and he says, and you up [[05:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18715.14s)]
*  there that just gave your last 67 cents. [[05:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18718.739999999998s)]
*  You know that gift means far more than these people who give $10 when they can afford to [[05:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18722.059999999998s)]
*  give a hundred. [[05:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18726.059999999998s)]
*  So as it turned out, the temple had assigned someone to sit behind them. [[05:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18728.54s)]
*  And when he mentioned the 67 cents, it was jotted down and the note was passed up to [[05:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18733.42s)]
*  Jim on stage. [[05:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18737.579999999998s)]
*  That's an old trick from his days on the revival circuit. [[05:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18738.579999999998s)]
*  But Tim didn't know that. [[05:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18742.18s)]
*  He was already a guy who believed in psychic phenomenon, believed that he merged with the [[05:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18744.34s)]
*  universe in Vietnam and he kind of self-selected as a person who had already responded to an [[05:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18749.3s)]
*  article about a miracle working preacher. [[05:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18756.5s)]
*  So he was like, wow. [[05:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18759.06s)]
*  And Jim Jones had him. [[05:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18761.26s)]
*  And since he'd been homeless, Tim Carter was soon asked if he'd like to come up to Ukiah [[05:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18763.54s)]
*  and live in one of the temple's communal homes and join the movement full time. [[05:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18768.7s)]
*  And so he did. [[05:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18772.02s)]
*  And this wanderer, this lost, broken wanderer who'd been filled with anger and had been [[05:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18773.22s)]
*  on the brink of launching a random knife attack on City Hall, suddenly finds the sense of [[05:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18779.620000000003s)]
*  belonging and peace and joy that had been eluding him his entire life. [[05:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18785.280000000002s)]
*  And it was all because of this miraculous preacher. [[05:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18790.82s)]
*  And so one day, Tim Carter remembers he was passing by Jim Jones in a hallway and Jim [[05:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18793.98s)]
*  turns to him and says, Tim, I just want you to know I'll fuck you in the ass if you want [[05:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18801.3s)]
*  me to. [[05:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18807.1s)]
*  And so things are beginning to get strange. [[05:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18810.579999999998s)]
*  Although again, I want to emphasize something. [[05:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18813.899999999998s)]
*  The reason I spent so much time talking about the rest of the radical left movements in [[05:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18816.02s)]
*  which people's temple was embedded and from which its members were being drawn, its leadership [[05:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18820.46s)]
*  class at least, and with whom they continued to break bread like throughout the years is [[05:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18826.78s)]
*  that as weird as people's temple was in the context of the environment in which it was [[05:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18830.84s)]
*  operating, it was not really out of place. [[05:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18836.52s)]
*  You know, if the thing hadn't gone down the way it had at the end, it honestly would not [[05:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18840.72s)]
*  have made the top 10 craziest turns that radical movements took in the 1970s. [[05:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18846.04s)]
*  Anyway, to oversee the church's expanding activities, Jim orders the creation of something [[05:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18852.24s)]
*  called the Planning Commission. [[05:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18858.12s)]
*  It's initially made up of about 50 people, 50 of the most dedicated members from Indiana [[05:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18860.08s)]
*  and California, and these are people who really see the church first and foremost as a vehicle [[05:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18864.760000000002s)]
*  for social change. [[05:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18870.84s)]
*  After regular members would go home from a church service or a potluck, the Planning [[05:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18874.24s)]
*  Commission would stay behind and they would meet for hours on end, sometimes late into [[05:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18877.54s)]
*  the night, sometimes damn near to the next morning discussing church business and listening [[05:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18881.0s)]
*  to Jim discourse on politics and everything else that popped into his head. [[05:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18886.2s)]
*  At this point in their history, it would only be at these meetings that Jim would really [[05:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18891.72s)]
*  let loose on his politics. [[05:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18896.36s)]
*  He pushed these people in particular, he pushed them hard, calling them out for any sign of [[05:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18898.48s)]
*  slacking off, pointing out that he worked longer and harder than anyone, especially [[05:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18903.4s)]
*  when you consider how drained he was from the sexual demands that all of you selfish [[05:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18907.72s)]
*  people are putting on me. [[05:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18911.56s)]
*  These PC members, Planning Commission folks who were veterans of other left-wing organizations, [[05:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18914.2s)]
*  they imported those self-criticism sessions. [[05:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18919.2s)]
*  They brought that format into Planning Commission meetings. [[05:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18923.68s)]
*  They'd be bluntly calling out other members for their perceived shortcomings, especially [[05:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18926.079999999998s)]
*  the great shortcoming of lack of commitment to the cause or appreciation for Jim Jones, [[05:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18932.239999999998s)]
*  which more and more often and more and more were coming to be considered the same thing. [[05:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18937.44s)]
*  Now privacy was not a thing in the temple. [[05:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18944.6s)]
*  It was not a thing. [[05:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18946.8s)]
*  It shared that with all the other left-wing radical groups that would engage in these [[05:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18948.559999999998s)]
*  regular catharsis sessions. [[05:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18951.6s)]
*  That was what the temple called them. [[05:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18953.239999999998s)]
*  They had the same character as those infamous struggle sessions of the Bolsheviks and the [[05:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18955.76s)]
*  Weathermen and the students during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. [[05:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18959.199999999997s)]
*  Those are the models that the people in the temple were consciously emulating. [[05:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18963.96s)]
*  A dispute or a rocky marriage between two members, that was not a personal problem. [[05:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18967.399999999998s)]
*  It was a problem for the whole community. [[05:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18972.079999999998s)]
*  The whole community dealt with it. [[05:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18974.0s)]
*  Defending yourself against accusations was useless. [[05:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18976.64s)]
*  The point was to get the member under criticism to face up to what they were repressing or [[05:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18979.96s)]
*  denying their latent racism or sexism or anti-Semitism or their homosexuality. [[05:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18985.36s)]
*  Other members were encouraged to make accusations against other people, to bring up anything [[05:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18992.56s)]
*  that they had seen that might serve as an example of something that somebody had done. [[05:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=18997.52s)]
*  Defending another person was completely forbidden. [[05:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19006.32s)]
*  It was the quickest way to put yourself on the hot spot. [[05:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19008.68s)]
*  It bears resemblance to the social justice inquisition mobs we see form up in an online [[05:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19012.0s)]
*  version from time to time today where defending the target from even charges which are obviously [[05:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19016.600000000002s)]
*  spurious will just bring a share of that hostility down upon your own head. [[05:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19022.14s)]
*  Often merely refusing to join in with enough gusto, that was enough to bring negative attention [[05:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19027.26s)]
*  upon yourself. [[05:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19033.84s)]
*  You've seen how it can go. [[05:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19034.84s)]
*  Why hasn't so-and-so spoken out about such-and-such? [[05:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19037.059999999998s)]
*  Why hasn't so-and-so denounced the person we've decided today is bad? [[05:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19040.26s)]
*  It's very similar to that, but it's undiluted by the presence of any dissenting opinions. [[05:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19043.38s)]
*  Friends in person, with people that you know well, these are your friends and your family. [[05:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19049.22s)]
*  These are the ones accusing you. [[05:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19053.780000000002s)]
*  Your friends and family would often be the fiercest for fear of betraying special loyalties [[05:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19055.34s)]
*  or a clickishness that put themselves and a few others above the rest of the group. [[05:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19059.98s)]
*  The subject of sex increasingly became an obsession during these meetings. [[05:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19065.74s)]
*  Official temple policy was that it was inappropriate for revolutionaries to selfishly waste their [[05:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19069.780000000002s)]
*  time on sex when there are so many people suffering in the world. [[05:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19074.7s)]
*  And the catharsis sessions would often consist of members calling out others for suspected [[05:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19078.46s)]
*  sexual liaisons and then bringing that couple before the group to learn their lesson. [[05:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19082.26s)]
*  Members who were obeying the injunction against sexual activity, or more often just those [[05:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19089.079999999998s)]
*  who found it more difficult to find willing partners, they would lead the attack against [[05:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19093.34s)]
*  the other members that they resented for doing it. [[05:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19098.14s)]
*  The only authorized way to have sex in the temple, really, was to have sex with Jim Jones, [[05:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19101.54s)]
*  which is one reason that over time more and more of the attractive white women gravitated [[05:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19106.14s)]
*  to his inner circle in order to immunize themselves against attack by the planning commission. [[05:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19111.98s)]
*  Over the years, catharsis sessions in people's temple would take up more and more of their [[05:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19117.96s)]
*  time. [[05:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19122.059999999998s)]
*  It got to the point where the planning commission would meet all night, every night, and that's [[05:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19123.059999999998s)]
*  all they would do. [[05:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19125.94s)]
*  The withering verbal and emotional abuse would eventually expand to brutal physical abuse. [[05:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19128.3s)]
*  Members who were not on the PC but who were still involved more than the average Sunday [[05:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19134.54s)]
*  parishioner, they'd hear rumors and stories, and it got to where everybody walked on eggshells [[05:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19139.3s)]
*  around everyone else all the time, watching every word and making sure they kept nice [[05:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19144.100000000002s)]
*  plastic smiles plastered across their faces at all times for fear of being pulled aside [[05:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19148.84s)]
*  and told that their presence was required at tonight's meeting of the PC. [[05:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19153.620000000003s)]
*  Jim would preside over the meetings, sometimes ranting for hours about politics or religion, [[05:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19158.34s)]
*  other times just guiding the proceedings with prompts, suggestions, rulings, while [[05:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19163.66s)]
*  the other people just laid into one another. [[05:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19168.02s)]
*  Sometimes he wouldn't be there at all. [[05:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19171.72s)]
*  People would just do this themselves. [[05:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19172.9s)]
*  They didn't need him around for it. [[05:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19173.9s)]
*  When he was there, Jim was very clever about positioning himself as the good cop. [[05:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19175.62s)]
*  He'd say that he'd hate to have to discipline someone, but it's for their own good, of course, [[05:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19181.1s)]
*  and then the other people would just start going off. [[05:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19186.9s)]
*  As they worked each other up into a frenzy of attack, it would always be Jim to step [[05:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19190.02s)]
*  in and say enough is enough. [[05:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19195.06s)]
*  He was the only one authorized to do that. [[05:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19196.66s)]
*  He was the only one who could step in and say they've had enough. [[05:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19198.38s)]
*  If you tried that and you were one of the normal members, you would get attacked too. [[05:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19204.46s)]
*  Each member tried to outdo the others with displays of their dedication and love for [[05:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19210.8s)]
*  poor people and for black people and for Jim Jones. [[05:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19215.46s)]
*  It was just this one big spiral. [[05:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19218.78s)]
*  There was one damaged specimen, Sharon Amos, who had joined the church as a young woman [[05:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19221.02s)]
*  after she'd run away when her schizophrenic mother tried to strangle her to death with [[05:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19228.739999999998s)]
*  the leash of the family dog. [[05:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19233.219999999998s)]
*  Her devotion to Jim Jones crossed over into psychosis. [[05:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19237.219999999998s)]
*  At one meeting, she stood up and pledged that in order to be able to give the temple more [[05:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19242.14s)]
*  money, she would from then on start feeding her three children nothing but birdseed. [[05:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19246.42s)]
*  Even Jim didn't know what to say to that, but thankfully she was put off that idea. [[05:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19252.14s)]
*  Years later, when the call came down that the much talked about mass suicide was finally [[05:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19257.62s)]
*  happening, Sharon Amos was not at Jonestown at the time. [[05:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19264.1s)]
*  She was in the Guyanese capital at a building that the people's temple ran. [[05:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19268.14s)]
*  She got the call and she marched her three kids into a bathroom and slit their throats [[05:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19273.54s)]
*  with a kitchen knife before killing herself. [[05:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19277.86s)]
*  At these early planning commission meetings, there was this unspoken awkwardness that pervaded [[05:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19281.34s)]
*  everything. [[05:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19287.940000000002s)]
*  Because Marceline had to sit through these things alongside many temple women who were [[05:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19288.940000000002s)]
*  sleeping with her husband and everybody knew about it, including her. [[05:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19294.02s)]
*  She'd been having a very difficult time with Jim's philandering, especially with how he [[05:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19297.74s)]
*  conducted it so brazenly right under her nose. [[05:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19302.94s)]
*  She'd married Jim Jones as a young Christian woman who was hoping for something like a [[05:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19306.26s)]
*  normal family to comfort her, even if Jim's ambitions required his attention outside the [[05:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19311.14s)]
*  home, but now she was becoming resigned to the fact that that was never going to happen. [[05:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19316.46s)]
*  So she was confused and depressed and she had nobody to confide in because nobody she [[05:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19321.86s)]
*  knew was capable of thinking or speaking about her husband in anything other than completely [[05:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19326.7s)]
*  sycophantic terms. [[05:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19331.14s)]
*  One time she had informed Jim that she was going to take the children and get a divorce, [[05:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19334.34s)]
*  but she was no match for Jim's talent for manipulation and she backed down when he turned [[05:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19339.42s)]
*  the kids against her for trying to break up the family. [[05:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19344.5s)]
*  One time he threatened that she would die before she left with the kids. [[05:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19348.059999999998s)]
*  It was a threat that he framed as a prophecy, like he was predicting that this would happen, [[05:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19352.219999999998s)]
*  but she had already seen how far Jim was often willing to go to make sure his prophecies [[05:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19356.14s)]
*  came true. [[05:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19360.86s)]
*  While the Indiana members loved her and might have even been split over what to do if Jim [[05:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19364.02s)]
*  really tried to turn them against her, she didn't doubt for a second that many of these [[05:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19370.06s)]
*  newer radical, fanatical California members would carry out any task that Jim Jones assigned [[05:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19373.9s)]
*  to them. [[05:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19381.66s)]
*  Even absent the threats, Marceline at the end of the day, she just couldn't bear the [[05:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19384.940000000002s)]
*  thought of leaving her children. [[05:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19389.84s)]
*  She wasn't going to leave alone. [[05:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19391.56s)]
*  Even Jim, Jim just had her number, just like he always had everyone's number. [[05:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19393.4s)]
*  He had the abuser's touch, able to alternate between frightening and charming her, being [[05:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19399.9s)]
*  threatening one minute and the next seeming as though his fits were just the immature [[05:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19406.44s)]
*  petulance of a boy, a child who needed someone like Marceline to look after him, for all [[05:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19410.8s)]
*  is seeming impotent, really just vulnerable. [[05:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19417.120000000003s)]
*  Although she often cried herself to sleep, at the moment of despair, Jim would just seem [[05:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19422.960000000003s)]
*  like he'd seem innocent, and she couldn't bear the idea of him alone in the world surrounded [[05:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19427.2s)]
*  only by people who didn't know him like she did. [[05:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19433.38s)]
*  There are a lot of wives who were physically and emotionally abused who would understand [[05:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19438.640000000003s)]
*  this mentality very, very easily. [[05:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19444.100000000002s)]
*  John Nash, the mentally ill mathematician that I spoke about earlier, he was often [[05:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19446.76s)]
*  vicious and unpredictably cruel to his wife, and her life was unbearable as a result, but [[05:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19451.84s)]
*  she put up with him for years. [[05:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19457.239999999998s)]
*  She tried her best to nurse and save him. [[05:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19459.039999999997s)]
*  Finally Marceline couldn't handle the strain any longer. [[05:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19462.28s)]
*  She would either change or die, and she knew she didn't have it in her to leave, and so [[05:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19464.64s)]
*  instead she just accepted her lot. [[05:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19469.359999999997s)]
*  She just accepted it. [[05:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19471.84s)]
*  She accepted that the situation was kind of her cross to bear, and so at an early planning [[05:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19473.12s)]
*  commission meeting, she decided that she was going to put all the awkwardness to rest. [[05:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19478.559999999998s)]
*  She stood up and addressed the assembled members directly, and she apologized for having been [[05:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19482.36s)]
*  so selfish with regard to Jim's affections. [[05:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19487.399999999998s)]
*  She said the work of the temple was too important, and she'd come to understand that many [[05:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19491.28s)]
*  people in the temple needed to relate to the movement in a way that could only be fulfilled [[05:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19496.76s)]
*  personally, intimately by her husband, and she promised that from now on she was going [[05:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19501.12s)]
*  to be willing to share him because her husband's role as father to the church was more important [[05:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19505.76s)]
*  than any of her petty jealousies, you know, jealousies for which she hoped they'd forgive [[05:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19512.0s)]
*  her. [[05:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19517.2s)]
*  And with that she walked out of the meeting, and Jim was very pleased. [[05:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19518.64s)]
*  He had broken her, and from that point until the massacre at Jonestown was already underway, [[05:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19522.079999999998s)]
*  she played the good and loyal wife and did not challenge her husband again. [[05:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19528.12s)]
*  Tim Stone's wife, Grace, did not share Marceline's submissiveness. [[05:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19533.8s)]
*  She was not the type to tolerate being ignored or disrespected, and so it didn't take long [[05:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19538.039999999997s)]
*  for Tim's absenteeism to get old for her. [[05:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19542.92s)]
*  He'd been very attentive when their relationship began, and this was not what she'd signed [[05:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19546.44s)]
*  up for. [[05:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19550.96s)]
*  When she complained, Tim, you know, at this point a total, total ideologue and totally [[05:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19552.12s)]
*  subservient to Jim Jones, he would just chastise her for being insufficiently socialist. [[05:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19556.46s)]
*  Grace had come to admire Jim Jones for the work that he clearly put in on behalf of other [[05:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19562.46s)]
*  people, but she did not worship him, not like her husband did. [[05:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19566.34s)]
*  So Tim and Grace's relationship hit the skids, and the way Tim tells the story, it was really [[05:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19570.32s)]
*  all Jim's fault, you see. [[05:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19575.82s)]
*  One day Jim approached Tim Stone and he complained that the demands of temple women for his sexual [[05:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19578.26s)]
*  attention had become just too much for him. [[05:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19583.28s)]
*  He didn't have the time or energy to meet his obligations to his people, and yet these [[05:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19586.76s)]
*  women needed him. [[05:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19590.64s)]
*  What was he to do? [[05:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19592.46s)]
*  And so he asked Tim, could you pretty please help me by having sex with one of the particularly [[05:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19593.46s)]
*  needy women? [[05:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19600.899999999998s)]
*  Well, of course Tim was married to Grace, but gosh, if it was for the good of the church [[05:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19602.5s)]
*  and this poor woman, all while right, I suppose in the name of service to my fellow man, that's [[05:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19608.14s)]
*  Tim's version of how his infidelity began. [[05:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19616.14s)]
*  At one point Grace asked him point blank if Jim had asked him to begin sleeping with the [[05:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19620.92s)]
*  woman and he denied it. [[05:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19624.78s)]
*  After the fact he claimed he was just covering for Jim, and I suppose since neither Jim nor [[05:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19627.18s)]
*  the woman are around to dispute the story he can claim whatever he wants. [[05:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19631.239999999998s)]
*  When she asked the question, Tim went to Jim straight away to inform on her, writing [[05:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19636.38s)]
*  a letter to Jim that he worried about his wife's loyalty to the church and warning [[05:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19641.14s)]
*  Jim that she might come around asking loaded questions. [[05:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19645.66s)]
*  You see a lot of this from temple members who survived the mass suicide. [[05:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19648.86s)]
*  They were just naive, that's all. [[05:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19652.66s)]
*  They were just too trusting and really too idealistic. [[05:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19654.940000000002s)]
*  They just wanted to help people so much that Jim Jones was able to play on that and he [[05:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19658.620000000003s)]
*  really knew how to prey on their ardent desire to serve their fellow human beings. [[05:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19663.62s)]
*  When you have spent years involved in a sexually abusive, insane suicide cult, you've got [[05:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19669.52s)]
*  to come up with something to tell people so that they don't hold you responsible for what [[05:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19678.66s)]
*  happened because it's not like Jim Jones could have done any of this himself. [[05:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19682.18s)]
*  He did not. [[05:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19686.94s)]
*  So after Tim begins his liaison with this woman, Jim makes sure that Grace finds out [[05:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19690.06s)]
*  about it and sometime around then, Grace has sex with Jim Jones. [[05:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19694.72s)]
*  During this period of friction between Tim and Grace, Grace Stone becomes pregnant. [[05:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19700.86s)]
*  She knew the temple policy on pregnancy. [[05:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19707.34s)]
*  There were starving children available for adoption and the world was overpopulated as [[05:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19710.140000000003s)]
*  it was and so any woman who became pregnant in the church was expected to get an abortion, [[05:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19713.9s)]
*  point blank. [[05:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19720.260000000002s)]
*  So when her condition became common knowledge, she was confronted at a planning commission [[05:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19722.260000000002s)]
*  meeting about it. [[05:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19727.140000000003s)]
*  Of all people, the woman that her husband had been having an affair with, the one she [[05:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19728.620000000003s)]
*  knew about at least, led the charge against her, suggesting that if she insisted on worsening [[05:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19733.16s)]
*  the world's overpopulation problem, then she and not her husband, the church or anyone [[05:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19739.280000000002s)]
*  else should have to pay for all the costs of childbirth. [[05:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19743.600000000002s)]
*  Some of the people there insulted her selfishness and others laughed at her, made fun of her. [[05:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19747.72s)]
*  Despite fierce pressure to abort the child, Grace was determined to bring it to term but [[05:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19754.120000000003s)]
*  she was determined to do it alone by this point. [[05:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19758.0s)]
*  Finally confronting Tim about his infidelity, he used the righteousness defense. [[05:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19761.72s)]
*  She pointed out that all the women that he'd been with were not even that attractive and [[05:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19766.16s)]
*  shouldn't that be proof that he'd really only been doing it as an act of compassion, you [[05:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19770.44s)]
*  know, to help them? [[05:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19774.079999999998s)]
*  Maybe that sounded like a plausible defense to him but it didn't to Grace and she soon [[05:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19776.6s)]
*  told him that she couldn't live with them anymore. [[05:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19781.32s)]
*  Both Grace and Tim remained in the church though and they both remained loyal to Jim [[05:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19785.539999999997s)]
*  Jones who at this point must have felt like, I can get away with anything. [[05:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19790.1s)]
*  I mean he must have felt like he could do no wrong. [[05:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19795.1s)]
*  So from his perspective things are going pretty well. [[05:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19799.82s)]
*  The church is expanding its operations and holding regular events in San Francisco. [[05:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19803.02s)]
*  You know, he's basking in the attention of beautiful young women and he's broken his [[05:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19809.06s)]
*  wife's resistance to that. [[05:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19814.34s)]
*  He's surrounded by people who adore him and a dedicated cadre of young activists ready [[05:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19816.46s)]
*  to make his life's ambitions their own. [[05:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19822.3s)]
*  Money was a problem. [[05:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19825.899999999998s)]
*  There was that. [[05:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19827.54s)]
*  You know, donations hardly covered the temple's operating expenses let alone his grand plans [[05:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19828.54s)]
*  but Jim had a plan for that too. [[05:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19834.02s)]
*  Plan that he had been waiting to hatch for over 10 years. [[05:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19836.579999999998s)]
*  The other Divine was dead and now it was time to go inherit his crown. [[05:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19840.78s)]
*  So Jim prepared his people meticulously for this operation. [[05:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19847.3s)]
*  Divine had actually died in 65 and the movement had been putting along under the guidance [[05:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19851.379999999997s)]
*  of his young white widow. [[05:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19856.26s)]
*  In the past in Indianapolis, you know, Jim had tried and failed to take over Laurel [[05:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19858.699999999997s)]
*  Street Tabernacle Church. [[05:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19865.14s)]
*  He had tried and failed to infiltrate the Golden Rule in Ukiah. [[05:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19867.3s)]
*  But Divine's peace mission was always the prize. [[05:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19871.7s)]
*  This is a multi-million dollar nationwide empire that would allow Jim to accelerate [[05:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19873.7s)]
*  through years of developing people's temple on his own and instantly vault him into the [[05:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19878.7s)]
*  ranks of the most important figures on the American left. [[05:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19884.059999999998s)]
*  The things he could do if he got control of this thing. [[05:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19887.399999999998s)]
*  Father Divine's widow, we'll call her Mother Divine, she had had a few years to build loyalty [[05:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19892.46s)]
*  in the peace mission. [[05:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19898.5s)]
*  You know, Father Divine, like I said, had been dead for a few years but, you know, Jim [[05:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19899.5s)]
*  had gotten no sense when he met her that she could present a credible challenge to him. [[05:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19902.66s)]
*  Many in the peace mission knew and respected Jim Jones and they knew of his good relationship [[05:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19907.66s)]
*  with Father Divine. [[05:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19912.579999999998s)]
*  Divine himself had planted the seeds that Jim was going to use when he justified his [[05:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19915.22s)]
*  remarriage to his new wife by claiming that his dead wife's spirit had transmigrated into [[05:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19922.38s)]
*  her body. [[05:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19927.620000000003s)]
*  If Divine's people had bought that, why wouldn't they believe that Father Divine's spirit had [[05:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19928.620000000003s)]
*  taken up residence in the body of a young, charismatic healer working every day for racial [[05:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19933.920000000002s)]
*  justice? [[05:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19939.420000000002s)]
*  So Jim had his people learn peace mission songs and memorize facts about Father Divine. [[05:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19942.06s)]
*  He had them studying, preparing, practicing. [[05:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19947.9s)]
*  They began to call him Father and Marceline Mother. [[05:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19950.420000000002s)]
*  That's when they began this, just as Father Divine's followers would have been familiar [[05:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19953.140000000003s)]
*  with and that habit would become permanent. [[05:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19956.38s)]
*  And so Jim eventually, when he was ready, loaded up more than 200 of his followers, [[05:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19959.86s)]
*  black and white, into a train of buses and they made their way to Philadelphia. [[05:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19964.86s)]
*  And they were welcomed as guests of honor when they got there. [[05:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19970.38s)]
*  Room was found for them in the peace missions hotels in downtown Philly, but they were not [[05:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19973.9s)]
*  there for a social call. [[05:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19977.86s)]
*  Temple members scoped the buildings. [[05:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19980.3s)]
*  They were interviewing peace mission followers and gathering intelligence about them in little [[05:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19982.5s)]
*  notebooks. [[05:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19986.02s)]
*  Jim and some close aides remained at the mansion with Mother Divine and that's when Jim began [[05:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19987.82s)]
*  to put his plan in motion. [[05:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19993.22s)]
*  They were led down to the elaborate burial chamber lined with 24 karat gold wall tiles [[05:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=19995.98s)]
*  where two bronze statue angels were perched atop a limestone sarcophagus containing the [[05:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20001.98s)]
*  remains of Father Divine. [[05:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20008.38s)]
*  Jim Jones and Mother Divine stepped forward from the group to approach the body, the sarcophagus, [[05:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20011.3s)]
*  and they read the inscription on it. [[05:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20017.1s)]
*  Father coming to the country that is supposed to be the country of the free. [[05:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20018.94s)]
*  And Jim annoyed Mother Divine right off the bat by kind of breaking the solemnity of [[05:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20024.14s)]
*  the moment with a snarky comment, supposed to be the country of the free, but she let [[05:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20028.3s)]
*  it go. [[05:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20033.86s)]
*  And so as the people filed out, Jim held back with Divine's widow. [[05:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20034.86s)]
*  Alone with her, he revealed that her husband's spirit had come to rest in his own body. [[05:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20039.94s)]
*  Divine had returned to the world to continue his mission in the form of Jim Jones. [[05:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20047.7s)]
*  And perhaps more cleverly than Jim had anticipated, Mother Divine put him off kind of diplomatically. [[05:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20055.58s)]
*  She said that Father Divine had always told his people that upon his passing, his spirit [[05:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20061.26s)]
*  would pass into each and every one of us and that all people who sought to do good in the [[05:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20066.18s)]
*  world would have a piece of, have a share of his spirit. [[05:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20070.5s)]
*  Pretty good. [[05:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20076.46s)]
*  And she said this was true of Jim, but then she was more direct about it. [[05:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20077.46s)]
*  No one can take Father's place. [[05:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20081.66s)]
*  You're no more special than anyone else. [[05:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20084.02s)]
*  And so later, at a feast given in the honor of the temple visitors, in the grand banquet [[05:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20087.46s)]
*  hall of a Peace Mission Hotel, Divine's followers are singing songs praising their deceased [[05:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20092.98s)]
*  leader. [[05:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20098.18s)]
*  And to Mother Divine's horror, the temple members who were prepared for this, they respond [[05:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20099.18s)]
*  on cue. [[05:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20102.7s)]
*  They are raising their arms and rapturously swaying to the praise songs, only they're [[05:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20103.74s)]
*  directing their worship toward Jim as Father Divine returned in the flesh. [[05:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20107.7s)]
*  Jim's people stood and one after another throughout the night are giving these well-practiced [[05:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20114.02s)]
*  testimonies to the love and compassion and the great power of Jim Jones. [[05:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20118.940000000002s)]
*  And finally, Jim stands to address the Peace Mission members directly. [[05:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20122.86s)]
*  Father Divine has conferred his mantle on me. [[05:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20129.06s)]
*  We are from the same celestial plane and are messengers. [[05:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20132.46s)]
*  His spirit has come to rest in my body. [[05:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20136.34s)]
*  And a gasp goes up from the Peace Mission followers. [[05:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20139.3s)]
*  Could it be true? [[05:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20143.26s)]
*  They looked up at Jim and they look at one another and to the temple members who are [[05:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20145.18s)]
*  alternately gazing toward them with affected love and welcome and then toward Jim and rapturous [[05:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20149.34s)]
*  worship. [[05:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20155.1s)]
*  Mother Divine is beside herself. [[05:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20156.34s)]
*  So she stands up and tells Jim that he and his people must leave immediately. [[05:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20159.54s)]
*  And she announced to her people that he was not Father Divine and in fact may actually [[05:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20165.3s)]
*  be that other fellow, the devil. [[05:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20169.26s)]
*  Some of the Peace Mission members bought the charade and they would return on the buses [[05:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20173.62s)]
*  to the temple in California, but not enough of them. [[05:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20176.88s)]
*  Jim had been so confident in his charisma. [[05:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20180.74s)]
*  Within his own bubble, you know, his people competed with one another to turn his every [[05:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20184.14s)]
*  whim into a reality. [[05:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20188.56s)]
*  He hardly remembered what it was like to be told no. [[05:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20190.600000000002s)]
*  He thought that Mother Divine, unmarried at 45, isolated in her splendor at the top of [[05:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20194.780000000002s)]
*  this personality cult, that she could be bowled over by his charisma and that she would welcome [[05:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20201.68s)]
*  being joined by a man who could take the reins of Divine's movement and allow her to kind [[05:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20206.36s)]
*  of return to the secondary, more passive role of Peace Mission's First Lady. [[05:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20211.32s)]
*  But it turned out that she was not the pushover that he had imagined and his plan had failed. [[05:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20217.2s)]
*  His great grand plan had failed. [[05:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20222.940000000002s)]
*  Returning to California, his people wrote letters to Peace Mission members whose information [[05:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20226.64s)]
*  they gathered. [[05:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20230.84s)]
*  They spread rumors that while Jim and Mother Divine were down in the tomb of her husband, [[05:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20231.84s)]
*  she'd torn open her blouse and begged Jim to have sex with her atop the sarcophagus [[05:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20236.120000000003s)]
*  of Father Divine. [[05:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20241.36s)]
*  She became so angry when Jim refused that she'd rejected his offer to unite People's [[05:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20243.84s)]
*  Temple and the Peace Mission, even though she knew the truth that Jim was carrying the [[05:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20247.88s)]
*  spirit of Father Divine. [[05:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20251.68s)]
*  The campaign did have an effect. [[05:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20255.24s)]
*  A short time later, several empty buses were sent back to Philadelphia to collect defectors [[05:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20256.56s)]
*  and bring them out to California, but in the end it was only a few elderly women who got [[05:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20261.0s)]
*  back on those buses and headed to Cali. [[05:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20267.24s)]
*  There wasn't even any property to be had out of it. [[05:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20271.8s)]
*  In exchange for permanent residence in Temple communal care homes, the old ladies who came [[05:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20273.64s)]
*  over, they signed over their shares that they owned in Peace Mission properties, but Father [[05:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20277.92s)]
*  Divine had accounted for something like that and as it turned out, each Peace Mission member's [[05:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20282.96s)]
*  shares were set up to revert back to the organization after they died. [[05:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20286.88s)]
*  About a dozen old ladies was all the Temple had gotten out of his extensive preparations [[05:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20292.44s)]
*  for this Peace Mission coup. [[05:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20297.54s)]
*  This was a disaster for Jim Jones. [[05:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20299.6s)]
*  For years he had been plotting to take over the Peace Mission. [[05:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20302.32s)]
*  That was the plan, one he had shared with many of his followers whose help he needed [[05:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20306.3s)]
*  in the attempt and now he'd failed. [[05:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20310.96s)]
*  Now here he was, a pastor with a small, relatively small following in a rural Northern California [[05:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20314.68s)]
*  city, a would-be civil rights leader with almost no black people within a hundred miles, [[05:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20323.0s)]
*  head of a community that had uprooted their lives on his say-so who, like him, were working [[05:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20331.56s)]
*  multiple jobs just to keep the lights on for their kids and seniors. [[05:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20336.76s)]
*  Maybe Jim could have settled down in Ukiah as a small town pastor of a committed congregation. [[05:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20342.56s)]
*  They stuck with him after 1967 came and went along with his initial prediction of the [[05:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20349.4s)]
*  date of nuclear apocalypse, but they had followed him to California to save themselves and change [[05:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20354.2s)]
*  the world. [[05:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20360.4s)]
*  It was this sense of mission that kept his people together and bound to him. [[05:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20361.4s)]
*  I gave you my opinion on the fact that I think it was probably all the way back in Indianapolis [[05:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20368.600000000002s)]
*  when Jim Jones began to lose his mind, but it wasn't really until California that he [[05:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20373.4s)]
*  started requiring his followers to lose theirs as well. [[05:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20378.38s)]
*  After the failed takeover of the peace mission with people wondering about the direction [[05:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20383.02s)]
*  of the church and perhaps even questioning why they had left Indianapolis to live in [[05:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20387.2s)]
*  an all-white California cow town two hours from anywhere and with this new batch of Bay [[05:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20392.66s)]
*  Area radicals that had come up to be a part of this, having left San Francisco and Oakland [[05:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20399.620000000003s)]
*  and places where they might have been able to do more work. [[05:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20405.54s)]
*  Jim Jones called his people together and they assembled in the meeting place. [[05:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20409.86s)]
*  Marceline wrote the song list on the chalkboard and his son Stephen ran the chords for the [[05:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20416.54s)]
*  microphones while the rest of their family waited. [[05:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20422.54s)]
*  The Indiana flock trusted their leader to have a plan and the new California activists [[05:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20426.82s)]
*  waited anxiously to hear what it was. [[05:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20432.1s)]
*  Tim Stone sat next to Grace with her round pregnant belly. [[05:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20436.059999999998s)]
*  Carolyn directed the last of the people to their seats. [[05:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20441.699999999997s)]
*  They watched the stage where their leader would presently appear. [[05:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20446.219999999998s)]
*  Jim knew what his people were feeling. [[05:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20450.859999999997s)]
*  He had their pulse. [[05:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20452.42s)]
*  He knew how to build anticipation, you know, how to pluck all their emotions in the old [[05:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20454.899999999998s)]
*  Pentecostal style to make his service is something you wouldn't want to miss. [[05:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20460.36s)]
*  He knew people. [[05:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20465.8s)]
*  He knew a lot about how we work. [[05:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20466.8s)]
*  He couldn't have written a psychology textbook. [[05:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20470.12s)]
*  It was intuitive, but he knew us. [[05:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20471.920000000002s)]
*  When the band struck up at the precise moment and Jim walked out onto that stage, the wild [[05:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20475.08s)]
*  applause that his people flew into, it was natural and sincere and that's the level of [[05:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20479.4s)]
*  emotion he could keep them at throughout an entire church service. [[05:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20484.04s)]
*  He comes out and he joins in the music and leads the men in singing. [[05:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20488.76s)]
*  We live and die for freedom. [[05:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20492.719999999998s)]
*  We live and die for freedom. [[05:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20496.32s)]
*  And then the women and the children freedom, freedom, freedom. [[05:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20499.12s)]
*  And Jim begins to put his people to the test as the people sing and clap and dance. [[05:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20504.32s)]
*  He's cutting in with slogans to the tune of the song. [[05:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20511.559999999998s)]
*  No more poverty. [[05:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20514.0s)]
*  And then back to the singing, freedom down with racism, freedom. [[05:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20515.44s)]
*  Jim leads them into the closing chorus, freedom and speaking over it. [[05:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20521.96s)]
*  I'm here to show you as a sample, an example that you can bring yourself up by your own [[05:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20527.64s)]
*  bootstraps. [[05:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20531.56s)]
*  People began to cheer. [[05:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20533.58s)]
*  People go to church looking for God, but I'm here to show you that you can become your [[05:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20535.42s)]
*  own God, not in condescension, but in resurrection and upliftment from whatever economic condition [[05:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20538.56s)]
*  injustice or racism or servitude with which you have had to endure within you. [[05:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20544.84s)]
*  Rest the keys of deliverance. [[05:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20549.879999999997s)]
*  We ask for no condescending saviors that's been pawned off on every breast. [[05:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20551.92s)]
*  And I, God that came from of this earth, from this dust and this toil of this field, hardships [[05:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20556.12s)]
*  of labor from the lowest of economic positions, from the misery of poverty near the railroad [[05:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20562.44s)]
*  tracks. [[05:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20567.48s)]
*  I come to show you that the only God you need is within you. [[05:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20568.48s)]
*  And the responses come heavy. [[05:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20572.6s)]
*  Yeah, right on. [[05:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20574.199999999997s)]
*  Jim swaggering across the stage. [[05:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20576.64s)]
*  None other. [[05:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20578.519999999997s)]
*  That's my purpose in being here. [[05:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20580.0s)]
*  When that transition comes, there shall be no need for gods or any other kind of ideology. [[05:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20582.12s)]
*  Religion, the opiate of the people shall be removed from the consciousness of mankind. [[05:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20586.92s)]
*  There shall no longer be any need of anything called religion when freedom comes. [[05:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20592.28s)]
*  These people are feeling it, shouting back, they're approve you. [[05:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20596.48s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[05:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20599.16s)]
*  Yeah, you got it. [[05:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20600.16s)]
*  I came in the power of God and religion. [[05:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20602.36s)]
*  All the power you said God had, I have. [[05:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20605.12s)]
*  I have come to make one final dissolution, one final elimination of all religious feeling. [[05:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20608.04s)]
*  Until I have eradicated it from the face of the earth, I will do all the miracles you [[05:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20614.04s)]
*  said your God would do and never did. [[05:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20617.8s)]
*  I shall heal you of all the diseases. [[05:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20620.16s)]
*  I will provide you with the cures that you prayed for and never happened. [[05:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20622.24s)]
*  Jim liked to interrupt his rants with some wandering tangents. [[05:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20626.88s)]
*  He reminded everybody how he'd recently saved a woman from a fire by his prophecy and raised [[05:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20630.24s)]
*  a crippled woman to dance around the room. [[05:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20635.0s)]
*  People are cheering, answering back, affirming, shouting back at him. [[05:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20638.08s)]
*  He got a few hundred people in the room, fixed on Jim Jones like there's nothing else in [[05:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20641.4s)]
*  the world. [[05:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20645.72s)]
*  These are his people and he challenges them. [[05:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20646.72s)]
*  I see some are not aware of what God is. [[05:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20649.440000000002s)]
*  The only thing that brings perfect justice, freedom and equality, perfect love and all [[05:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20652.600000000002s)]
*  its beauty and holiness is socialism. [[05:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20657.480000000003s)]
*  Socialism. [[05:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20660.24s)]
*  The crowd goes freaking wild and Jim just flies into it. [[05:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20662.0s)]
*  I have taken myself a body, the same one that walked on the ancient plains of whom Solomon [[05:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20665.640000000003s)]
*  said his hair was as black as a raven and he said he would shave, as Isaiah said, 720 [[05:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20670.960000000003s)]
*  with a razor. [[05:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20676.760000000002s)]
*  I come shaved with a razor. [[05:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20677.88s)]
*  I come with the black hair of the raven. [[05:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20679.760000000002s)]
*  I come as God's socialist. [[05:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20682.480000000003s)]
*  He's shouting at the top of his lungs with a microphone and he's being drowned out by [[05:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20685.88s)]
*  the cheering at this point. [[05:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20689.88s)]
*  He waits for a law. [[05:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20691.6s)]
*  I shall show you from time to time, proofs of that so that you will have no further need [[05:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20692.920000000002s)]
*  of religion because the highest authority tells you so. [[05:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20697.6s)]
*  I come to you doing all the things you have ever imagined God to do and you have never [[05:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20700.6s)]
*  seen done. [[05:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20704.64s)]
*  It's beautiful to know God is a socialist worker. [[05:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20706.4s)]
*  He is one of the people. [[05:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20708.72s)]
*  He is all that you have desired. [[05:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20710.64s)]
*  All the freedom, justice, all the sensitivity in minds. [[05:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20712.24s)]
*  And I must say it's a great effort to be God. [[05:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20715.72s)]
*  Jim often framed his miracles just like his sexes, tasks, which they took a lot out of [[05:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20719.08s)]
*  him so he was not only healing and saving his people but doing so at great cost to himself [[05:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20724.2s)]
*  and in great difficulty. [[05:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20729.64s)]
*  So he points to a man in the audience. [[05:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20731.84s)]
*  My brother John came to me last week. [[05:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20734.0s)]
*  You were concerned that something was lost. [[05:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20736.36s)]
*  He lost it miles and miles away. [[05:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20739.04s)]
*  Well, my spirit retrieved it for you today. [[05:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20741.0s)]
*  Out of his sleeve, Jim produces brother John's lost credit card and he passes it to an aide [[05:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20745.0s)]
*  to bring to the amaze man and the crowd is going crazy and you hear some guy shout, God [[05:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20750.72s)]
*  damn, in the background. [[05:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20755.44s)]
*  And the music's going this whole time. [[05:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20758.12s)]
*  You've got to remember, the thing's a whole production where the organ would make a sort [[05:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20759.56s)]
*  of suspenseful music as Jim's describing that John has lost something and then rise right [[05:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20763.6s)]
*  at the moment that Jim pulls the credit card out to show the crowd and then it would go [[05:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20769.48s)]
*  into a sort of happy interlude when John receives his lost credit card. [[05:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20773.48s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing's got a soundtrack. [[05:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20777.88s)]
*  You know, there are periods when there's no music, but that's part of the soundtrack too. [[05:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20780.28s)]
*  So you have this emotional event where a grand master MC, Jim Jones, is pulling people around [[05:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20783.76s)]
*  with his words, but those words are amplified by the music and everything else, which really [[05:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20789.88s)]
*  just keys the people into the precise mood that Jim wants them to be in as he pushes [[05:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20794.72s)]
*  through this. [[05:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20799.52s)]
*  You know, and they're all doing it together. [[05:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20800.52s)]
*  They're in a place that they built with their own hands, building on each other's emotions, [[05:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20803.320000000003s)]
*  just cathartic emotional levels and feelings of being close to one another that, you know, [[05:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20807.920000000002s)]
*  they would achieve in these events. [[05:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20812.640000000003s)]
*  These people who had decided to move across the country so that they could live with each [[05:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20814.04s)]
*  other in a different kind of way. [[05:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20819.08s)]
*  And it's not easy. [[05:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20821.52s)]
*  And they're kind of out here on their own, but they're with each other together with [[05:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20822.800000000003s)]
*  their leader, the great man. [[05:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20827.36s)]
*  Tim Ryderman does a great job with this sermon. [[05:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20830.960000000003s)]
*  So I'll let him take it over from here. [[05:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20832.88s)]
*  With organ music and people keeping time with their hands, Jones shouted over them like [[05:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20836.52s)]
*  some Bible thumper, urging people not to hate because it boomerangs, decrying loopholes [[05:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20840.760000000002s)]
*  that let the rich escape taxes, calling for freedom from the bondage of the aristocratic [[05:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20845.920000000002s)]
*  rich. [[05:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20850.32s)]
*  Then, in a frantic and seemingly incoherent fashion, Jones railed about the theft of the [[05:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20851.32s)]
*  Bill of Rights, the spread of social disease, drug abuse by eight and nine year olds, and [[05:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20856.4s)]
*  drug pushing to fourth graders, even here in rural Redwood Valley. [[05:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20861.600000000002s)]
*  No heavenly God could cope with those things, could he? [[05:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20865.600000000002s)]
*  He reminded them of his own miracles and parapsychology and social goals, all in one breathless rush. [[05:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20868.440000000002s)]
*  If you don't need a God, fine. [[05:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20875.22s)]
*  But if you need a God, I'm going to nose out that God. [[05:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20877.02s)]
*  He's a false God. [[05:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20880.36s)]
*  I'll put the right concept in your life. [[05:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20881.8s)]
*  You understand the mystery? [[05:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20884.260000000002s)]
*  If you don't have a God and you're already believing that you have to build a society [[05:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20885.84s)]
*  to eliminate poverty, racism, and injustice in war, I will not bother you. [[05:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20889.120000000003s)]
*  But if you're holding onto that sky God, I'll nose him out ten lengths every time. [[05:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20894.120000000003s)]
*  Will you tell me you believe in a God out there? [[05:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20900.72s)]
*  He shrieked in anger at imaginary doubters. [[05:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20902.8s)]
*  So what? [[05:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20906.440000000002s)]
*  What's your sky God ever done? [[05:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20907.440000000002s)]
*  Two out of three nations in the world are hungry, misery, in every one of your homes. [[05:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20909.280000000002s)]
*  Then his voice rises to a crescendo. [[05:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20913.84s)]
*  The only happiness you've ever found is when you've come to this earth God. [[05:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20916.04s)]
*  Waiting for their cries to die down, he went on. [[05:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20921.24s)]
*  When you came to your socialist worker father, some of you never knew the fulfillment of [[05:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20924.04s)]
*  happiness. [[05:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20928.120000000003s)]
*  You never knew that anyone cared. [[05:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20929.120000000003s)]
*  Your children were in difficulties. [[05:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20930.88s)]
*  No one came to the jails. [[05:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20932.56s)]
*  You prayed to your sky God and he never heard your prayers. [[05:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20934.2s)]
*  You asked and begged and pleaded in your suffering and he never gave you any food. [[05:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20937.4s)]
*  He never gave you a bed. [[05:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20941.66s)]
*  He never provided a home. [[05:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20943.0s)]
*  But I, your socialist worker God, have given you all these things. [[05:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20944.24s)]
*  Then in a display of power, as though to demonstrate that no harm would befall blasphemers, he slammed [[05:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20948.760000000002s)]
*  a black Bible under the floor. [[05:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20954.04s)]
*  There were cheers. [[05:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20956.0s)]
*  No fears of doing that, he said, almost out of breath. [[05:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20957.0s)]
*  Say what you feel. [[05:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20960.2s)]
*  Tap all the resources of energy within you. [[05:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20961.640000000003s)]
*  No, it's not sacred. [[05:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20963.800000000003s)]
*  You won't die if... [[05:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20965.5s)]
*  He flung the book down again. [[05:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20966.600000000002s)]
*  If you drop it, you won't die if you stand on it. [[05:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20968.22s)]
*  He put both feet on the book, the toes of his shoes hanging over the edge and tottered [[05:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20971.14s)]
*  a little. [[05:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20975.18s)]
*  His audience delighted in the performance, reveled in his rebelliousness. [[05:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20976.18s)]
*  They too were above the Bible that had guided the lives of so many of them. [[05:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20980.38s)]
*  You won't die if you jump up and down on it. [[05:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20984.32s)]
*  Jones calmed himself purposefully. [[05:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20988.02s)]
*  He told them, I want you to realize that you must be the scripture, that any other scripture [[05:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20990.899999999998s)]
*  and the word that I am now imparting is idolatry. [[05:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=20996.98s)]
*  Yeah! [[05:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21001.02s)]
*  They were with him again. [[05:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21002.02s)]
*  He urged them and they urged back. [[05:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21003.38s)]
*  They were one. [[05:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21005.26s)]
*  I know where I am going. [[05:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21006.26s)]
*  I know what I believe and I know what I'm doing. [[05:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21008.14s)]
*  Jones hollered, straining for a peek. [[05:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21010.94s)]
*  And I've got a principle that will carry me on if the world passes away. [[05:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21013.22s)]
*  When your world has failed you, I'll be standing. [[05:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21016.899999999998s)]
*  Jim shouted, savoring each word as if it were being handed down from the Almighty. [[05:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21021.5s)]
*  Because I am freedom. [[05:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21026.74s)]
*  I am peace. [[05:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21028.66s)]
*  I am justice. [[05:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21030.3s)]
*  I am God. [[05:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21032.3s)]
*  The people went wild, cheering, cheering, cheering. [[05:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21035.3s)]
*  See socialism is God in me, he told them. [[05:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21040.9s)]
*  Look upon me harmoniously. [[05:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21044.5s)]
*  Every service I've said that socialism has a higher dimension than the three dimensions. [[05:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21046.92s)]
*  You don't have to worry about that God up there, he told those who still believed in [[05:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21051.26s)]
*  a heavenly being. [[05:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21054.78s)]
*  I can heal your back when your spine's wasting away and your doctor says you can't be helped [[05:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21056.059999999998s)]
*  and I can cure it. [[05:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21060.539999999997s)]
*  You're free. [[05:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21061.98s)]
*  You're free of that God. [[05:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21062.98s)]
*  I want you to penalize that old God up there. [[05:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21063.98s)]
*  He was ranting now, shouting at the heavens, challenging. [[05:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21066.42s)]

*  Something happened. [[05:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21081.14s)]
*  The people chortled. [[05:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21082.14s)]
*  That contest won. [[05:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21083.62s)]
*  Jones took it one step further. [[05:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21085.02s)]
*  When I was laying on springs with no covers and the rain was pouring to the roof of my [[05:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21086.86s)]
*  old ramshackle house and they told me to pray to God, there was no God that came. [[05:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21090.780000000002s)]
*  The rain kept pouring. [[05:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21095.98s)]
*  I had a beam of consciousness. [[05:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21097.38s)]
*  I said, there shouldn't be any poor. [[05:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21099.5s)]
*  There shouldn't be any private property. [[05:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21102.46s)]
*  The pain of poverty and disadvantage flowed from his voice. [[05:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21105.62s)]
*  A matter of fact righteousness, vengeance swelled in his chest. [[05:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21109.739999999998s)]
*  Every time I take a drive in the country, I see a private property, no trespassing sign. [[05:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21113.78s)]
*  I take those signs down. [[05:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21118.18s)]
*  A proving laughter all around. [[05:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21119.86s)]
*  When I want to trespass, I just trespass because they robbed the people to get it. [[05:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21121.86s)]
*  They took it from my people, the Indians. [[05:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21126.539999999997s)]
*  They came down and shot our babies, raped our mothers. [[05:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21128.98s)]
*  His words boomed like cannon fire. [[05:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21132.34s)]
*  They took our babies and stripped off the scalps. [[05:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21134.58s)]
*  He jumped from Indians to the precociousness of children of mixed races to sex. [[05:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21137.780000000002s)]
*  It's come up that there have been bisexual and homosexual patterns among church members, [[05:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21143.460000000003s)]
*  he said. [[05:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21147.300000000003s)]
*  And we got somebody coming in that won't tell the facts. [[05:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21148.800000000003s)]
*  And they say, I am a great lover. [[05:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21151.5s)]
*  Now I know what you told me. [[05:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21154.2s)]
*  He pauses and there is silence. [[05:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21156.56s)]
*  them out with his index finger, one cluck of tongue for each. [[05:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21159.78s)]
*  He was making their admissions for them, those homosexuals, latent and otherwise. [[05:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21166.6s)]
*  Raising his volume preacherly and righteously, he said, there can be nothing going on in [[05:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21172.059999999998s)]
*  the bedroom until mankind is liberated. [[05:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21176.62s)]

*  I've come to one of you. [[05:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21181.14s)]
*  I've come to all of you. [[05:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21182.5s)]
*  As I said, you'd be happier to admit it. [[05:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21184.36s)]
*  Right, a woman called out. [[05:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21186.940000000002s)]
*  Right, a man called out. [[05:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21189.06s)]
*  Right, came a whole chorus of voices. [[05:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21191.260000000002s)]
*  I told you before, throughout his whole life, Jim Jones would respond to being backed into [[05:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21197.140000000003s)]
*  a corner by coming out swinging. [[05:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21203.38s)]
*  If Jim Jones couldn't have Father Divine's movement, fine, he would build one himself. [[05:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21206.5s)]
*  To do that, he needed money and he needed people. [[05:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21211.18s)]
*  So he went back to what he knew using the two assets that he did have at his disposal, [[05:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21214.86s)]
*  his own charisma and the tireless dedication of his people. [[05:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21219.58s)]
*  So Jim Jones and his people hit the road. [[05:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21225.940000000002s)]
*  They rented more buses and they started heading into San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, [[05:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21227.98s)]
*  Seattle. [[05:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21233.82s)]
*  Members in cars would go first, proceed them by a week or so or maybe a few days and they [[05:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21234.82s)]
*  would scout locations to hold their revival meetings, making arrangements and then papering [[05:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21239.66s)]
*  the whole city with leaflets and flyers announcing that the famous wonder worker, Pastor Jim [[05:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21244.18s)]
*  Jones was coming to town. [[05:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21248.38s)]
*  They walked the streets of minority and poor white neighborhoods spreading rumors about [[05:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21251.22s)]
*  the miraculous healings, prophecies and resurrections that had been witnessed in previous services. [[05:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21254.9s)]
*  Multitudes had been healed, even raised from the dead and through his clairvoyant gift, [[05:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21261.98s)]
*  he had averted countless calamities that otherwise would have brought people to their doom. [[05:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21266.86s)]
*  Also there would be music and a free meal after the service so people could come for [[05:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21272.22s)]
*  that reason. [[05:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21275.9s)]
*  They put a huge amount of effort into building a following in San Francisco and they were [[05:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21278.120000000003s)]
*  soon able to establish a permanent place for themselves in a location on Geary Boulevard [[05:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21282.420000000002s)]
*  in the Folsom District. [[05:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21287.7s)]
*  Jim knew from his days on the revival circuit that it was healing that really brought in [[05:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21291.100000000002s)]
*  money and so he started emphasizing that in a way that he hadn't been doing among his [[05:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21294.620000000003s)]
*  politically oriented audience up in Ukiah. [[05:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21299.579999999998s)]
*  The planning commission helped pull off the chicanery and when scouts spoke with people [[05:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21303.1s)]
*  who planned on attending, they took down any bit of information they might prove useful. [[05:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21307.94s)]
*  Spies would dig through the trash of attendees for empty medicine bottles, say, and people [[05:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21315.019999999997s)]
*  had no explanation but divine power when Jim called them out from the stage and identified [[05:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21319.68s)]
*  their illnesses. [[05:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21323.82s)]
*  If the spies found letters from debt collectors or late bills from utility companies, Jim [[05:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21326.3s)]
*  knew to identify those people with money problems and the church made careful investments. [[05:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21330.7s)]
*  Paying off one person's debt or late electric bill, that would bring in multiples of that [[05:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21336.78s)]
*  amount in the form of donations from the rest of the audience and it made sure that larger [[05:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21341.38s)]
*  and more excited crowds would show up at the next temple event. [[05:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21345.5s)]
*  Soon temple buses were heading out all across the whole country for months at a time on [[05:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21349.62s)]
*  carefully planned trips that brought them into dozens of cities on a single trip. [[05:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21354.820000000003s)]
*  The coordination was magnificent. [[05:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21361.54s)]
*  Each stop was preceded by energetic temple scouts who would find the venues, they would [[05:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21363.34s)]
*  find parks and campgrounds where temple members could sleep, they would introduce themselves [[05:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21368.38s)]
*  to local church leaders and set up collaborative events and guest sermons for Jim Jones and [[05:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21374.02s)]
*  they would go around spreading the good news and even gathering information about local [[05:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21379.22s)]
*  issues and politics that Jim could use when he was giving his speeches. [[05:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21383.42s)]
*  Jim was a sponge. [[05:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21387.66s)]
*  He would do an event in one city, pack up the buses, drive through the night to the [[05:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21389.579999999998s)]
*  next destination and by the time he arrived he'd soaked up enough information to be ready [[05:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21394.219999999998s)]
*  to play on local political controversies and to call out audience members by name, prophesying [[05:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21398.059999999998s)]
*  and healing them. [[05:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21403.94s)]
*  Jim Jones was good at this. [[05:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21405.98s)]
*  There's just no other way to put it. [[05:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21407.339999999997s)]
*  He was never shy about adapting someone else's good ideas. [[05:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21410.14s)]
*  Just as he had taken up Father Devine's organizational structure, he ripped off a practice that he'd [[05:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21413.34s)]
*  gotten from a dude named Reverend Ike who was a famous black evangelist back in the [[05:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21417.78s)]
*  day who would sell pictures of himself and vials of water that he'd blessed as holy [[05:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21422.14s)]
*  water, bits of cloth from robes that he'd worn and other little trinkets and relics [[05:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21427.1s)]
*  that would promise to protect their owner from various illnesses and accidents and so [[05:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21431.78s)]
*  forth. [[05:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21436.739999999998s)]

*  calamities. [[05:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21441.82s)]
*  Whether people believed in the hocus pocus or just wanted souvenirs, this made money [[05:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21444.059999999998s)]
*  hand over fist. [[05:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21448.859999999997s)]

*  Jim truly did not see it that way. [[05:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21455.059999999998s)]
*  The church started raking in money from this stuff but Jim Jones never lived some extravagant [[05:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21458.3s)]
*  life. [[05:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21464.179999999997s)]
*  Reverend Ike, the guy that Jim took the idea of selling pictures and trinkets from, he [[05:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21465.18s)]
*  was rolling around in big cars, living in mansions, fancy suits, jewelry. [[05:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21469.7s)]
*  The preacher you see on TV today, Joel Osteen, have you seen that guy's yacht? [[05:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21474.94s)]
*  Jim Jones never did any of that. [[05:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21480.66s)]
*  He never did any of that. [[05:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21483.420000000002s)]
*  All the way to the very end. [[05:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21486.38s)]
*  He wore old clothes, he drove a beat up car. [[05:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21487.58s)]
*  The only material privileges he ever took were later on in Jonestown he would have a [[05:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21491.58s)]
*  coke when everyone else was drinking water and he'd make some excuse about his blood [[05:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21497.66s)]
*  sugar or something. [[05:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21501.780000000002s)]
*  Even then he was a raging hypochondriac so he probably believed it. [[05:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21503.780000000002s)]
*  I guess it's a guy who when he was back in Indianapolis getting started with just a handful [[05:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21507.18s)]
*  of old black folks coming to his services, they couldn't afford to donate to the church. [[05:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21513.420000000002s)]
*  These people, they were coming to his church because they'd heard that Jim Jones was helping [[05:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21518.42s)]
*  people in need. [[05:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21523.539999999997s)]

*  to these people. [[05:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21530.26s)]
*  People wouldn't be able to make a utility bill or rent payment and Jim was coming out [[05:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21532.839999999997s)]
*  of his own pocket to help them. [[05:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21536.1s)]
*  Not out of the church's pocket. [[05:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21538.379999999997s)]
*  He was working multiple jobs just to keep the church open. [[05:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21539.82s)]
*  This was money that he was making by working those multiple jobs. [[05:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21543.86s)]
*  Don't ever forget that about Jim Jones. [[05:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21549.22s)]
*  Because if you forget that end of things, as we move into this last part of the story [[05:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21552.54s)]
*  and things get so crazy and go downhill, if you forget that side of it, it really cheapens [[05:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21561.62s)]
*  the whole story. [[05:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21567.7s)]
*  Jim Jones is working 18, 20 hours a day, every day, seven days a week for his church. [[05:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21569.22s)]
*  He is fully engaged. [[05:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21577.98s)]
*  Everyone says he has this extraordinary memory, inhuman memory when it came to people. [[05:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21579.780000000002s)]
*  He remembered everyone's name. [[05:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21584.940000000002s)]
*  If they told him anything about their family or something from their past or a problem [[05:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21587.22s)]
*  they were having, he remembered it. [[05:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21591.780000000002s)]
*  He would spend his day visiting people, calling on them, asking his people if they were having [[05:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21593.7s)]
*  problems and then spending the rest of the day doing whatever he could to help. [[05:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21599.02s)]
*  He was going hard. [[06:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21602.46s)]
*  And yet he never took a salary. [[06:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21604.46s)]
*  His family, for their personal needs, lived on what Marceline made in her job as a nurse. [[06:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21607.04s)]
*  Everything the church made went into church projects, or to help people in the church. [[06:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21613.58s)]
*  There were one or two times that Jim had to dip into church funds a bit because something [[06:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21618.74s)]
*  came up that he couldn't cover. [[06:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21623.12s)]
*  In those one or two instances, the board voted on it and approved it. [[06:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21625.5s)]
*  I'm not saying he didn't get anything out of this, obviously. [[06:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21629.7s)]
*  Power, adulation, sex, obviously those are important motivators and benefits, but it [[06:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21632.5s)]
*  wasn't about money. [[06:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21637.22s)]
*  It wasn't about anything material. [[06:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21638.22s)]
*  It's pretty clear that Jim actually enjoyed living as cheaply and simply as possible, [[06:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21640.46s)]
*  whether to make a point or not. [[06:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21646.22s)]
*  That's what he did. [[06:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21647.86s)]
*  Again, the dude's schedule was insane. [[06:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21648.86s)]
*  He would literally take his people down to San Francisco Saturday morning, set up in [[06:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21652.7s)]
*  an auditorium, do a morning service. [[06:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21657.18s)]
*  He was not a lazy preacher, as you just found out. [[06:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21659.260000000002s)]
*  He's up there getting down, shouting, sweating. [[06:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21661.7s)]
*  It's a party and he's the emcee. [[06:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21664.940000000002s)]
*  That ends, they do a potluck or something, and he makes the rounds ministering to his [[06:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21667.74s)]
*  people. [[06:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21671.66s)]
*  They get ready for an evening service. [[06:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21672.66s)]
*  He does it all again. [[06:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21673.66s)]
*  That finishes, they pack up, they get on the buses, they drive through the night to Los [[06:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21675.7s)]
*  Angeles. [[06:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21679.34s)]
*  Saturday morning, it's the same thing in LA. [[06:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21680.98s)]
*  Then they share a meal, they do an evening service in LA, they pack up, back on the buses, [[06:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21682.9s)]
*  eight or nine hour drive, back up to Ukiah, but they don't go to bed yet. [[06:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21687.420000000002s)]
*  They pile into the Ukiah building and the planning commission talks about the weekend's [[06:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21691.3s)]
*  events. [[06:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21694.78s)]
*  What went well, what went wrong, lessons learned, who was slacking off and who was working hard [[06:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21695.78s)]
*  and preparing for events and responsibilities. [[06:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21701.3s)]
*  They were set to begin in just a few hours on Monday morning. [[06:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21702.98s)]
*  People were sleeping underneath in the cargo bays, up in the luggage racks. [[06:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21707.859999999997s)]
*  That was some of the only time they could really find to get any consistent sleep. [[06:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21711.5s)]
*  All week, it drives to Oakland, San Francisco, Berkeley, back to Ukiah, back to LA for meetings [[06:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21716.699999999997s)]
*  to minister people, conducting planning commission meetings in the wee hours of the morning, [[06:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21723.019999999997s)]
*  increasingly every night. [[06:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21726.82s)]
*  A lot of these people were wrapping up PC meetings at two, three a.m., getting to bed [[06:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21729.379999999997s)]
*  at four, waking up at six because they had a job that started at seven. [[06:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21733.82s)]
*  The people who were going even that hard did not complain about it because they knew that [[06:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21738.7s)]
*  Jim Jones was going harder. [[06:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21743.34s)]
*  Whatever else he was, he was doing, he was not running a scam. [[06:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21747.06s)]
*  When Jim Jones said, from each according to their ability to each according to their need, [[06:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21752.46s)]
*  he wasn't just recommending that as a political program. [[06:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21756.66s)]
*  He believed that to act otherwise was a sin. [[06:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21760.5s)]
*  It was evil. [[06:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21763.9s)]
*  It was evil that there were people hungry or who couldn't afford medical care or a place [[06:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21766.18s)]
*  to live when other people were rich. [[06:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21770.98s)]
*  To him, that was the definition of evil. [[06:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21773.38s)]
*  That and the reasons that people would use to justify that, like racism. [[06:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21777.38s)]
*  It's okay that I'm rich and this other person is starving because da da da da da. [[06:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21781.7s)]
*  That was the definition of evil to Jim Jones. [[06:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21786.94s)]
*  If he was able to get you to part with some of your money by selling you some bullshit [[06:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21791.18s)]
*  so that that money could be redistributed in a more equitable way to somebody who needed [[06:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21795.66s)]
*  it more, he was not just helping the needy person. [[06:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21799.739999999998s)]
*  He was actually helping you by keeping you from committing sin. [[06:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21802.899999999998s)]
*  If I have to trick you in order to keep you from committing murder or rape or robbery [[06:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21808.1s)]
*  or some other evil, my trick is saving you from yourself. [[06:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21812.96s)]
*  The government threatens us with jail in order to collect taxes to pay for wars and prisons [[06:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21819.2s)]
*  and everyone says that's normal. [[06:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21824.52s)]
*  If we sell a picture of Jim Jones to some old bird who believes in me enough to pay [[06:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21827.3s)]
*  five dollars for a photo but doesn't believe in her sky god enough to give five dollars [[06:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21831.2s)]
*  to the poor, that's supposed to be a scam. [[06:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21836.28s)]
*  That's the way he thought about it. [[06:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21838.68s)]
*  He'd respond in his sermons to people who balked at seeing so many pictures of Jim Jones [[06:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21841.8s)]
*  around the temple and to people buying photos of him and saw it kind of as a form of idolatry. [[06:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21845.48s)]
*  He said, every church in the world tells you that you should do good because God is watching. [[06:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21850.04s)]
*  How's that working out? [[06:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21855.8s)]
*  You see a lot of good being done by people who claim to believe in that sky god, that [[06:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21857.96s)]
*  abstract nothing god. [[06:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21861.92s)]
*  People say, I must do good for God is watching. [[06:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21865.239999999998s)]
*  When they stepped over a homeless man on their way to church and didn't even notice him, [[06:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21869.08s)]
*  if love for that old buzzard god worked, you wouldn't need Jim Jones. [[06:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21874.600000000002s)]
*  I'd go sit in the pews and worship your sky god right alongside you and we wouldn't live [[06:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21878.120000000003s)]
*  in this world of racism and capitalist sin. [[06:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21882.760000000002s)]
*  Obviously it doesn't work. [[06:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21887.08s)]
*  Obviously most of you need something you can see and touch and who can stand in front of [[06:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21889.72s)]
*  you and provide an example. [[06:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21895.88s)]
*  You would tell them, you don't like my picture? [[06:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21898.44s)]
*  Fine, I don't care what you use. [[06:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21899.879999999997s)]
*  If you want to use pictures of Harriet Tubman, we'll use pictures of Harriet Tubman. [[06:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21902.239999999998s)]
*  Whatever it takes to get you people who have been so corrupted by habits of mind instilled [[06:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21905.32s)]
*  by a capitalist society to shake loose of it and actually start acting in the way that [[06:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21910.84s)]
*  you damn well know is right. [[06:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21915.48s)]
*  You can think of it as a kind of Robin Hood, you know, taking from people who have in order [[06:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21918.76s)]
*  to give to people who don't. [[06:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21922.76s)]
*  As you listen to all the hundreds of sermons, as I have, a kind of a coherent theology emerges [[06:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21924.56s)]
*  behind it. [[06:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21930.56s)]
*  Jim Jones saw the spirit of capitalism, you know, encouraging greed, competition, division, [[06:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21932.960000000003s)]
*  inequality, hatred. [[06:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21939.280000000002s)]
*  He saw that as the devil itself. [[06:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21940.36s)]
*  It was the devil. [[06:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21942.960000000003s)]
*  He didn't believe in some being called the devil. [[06:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21945.320000000003s)]
*  The devil was something that somebody could be possessed by. [[06:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21947.440000000002s)]
*  You know, as when Jesus told his disciple Peter, get thee behind me, Satan. [[06:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21951.28s)]
*  And Jim saw socialism as God, which also God was not a being. [[06:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21956.8s)]
*  It was a spirit that one could inhabit and which was synonymous with cooperation, love, [[06:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21962.239999999998s)]
*  brotherhood, that kind of thing. [[06:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21967.32s)]
*  The Bible says God is love and Jim Jones says socialism is love manifested economically [[06:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21969.68s)]
*  and politically. [[06:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21975.76s)]
*  And so Jim's worldview began to firm up. [[06:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21976.76s)]
*  The United States was the representative and chief enforcer of the devil because its reason [[06:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21980.56s)]
*  for existence seemed to be to stamp out and destroy socialism, God, wherever it was found. [[06:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21986.960000000003s)]
*  The man who years back had seen people's temple as a refuge for his people, you know, to escape [[06:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21994.68s)]
*  the possibility of nuclear war, now began to see his church sort of as more of a wartime [[06:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=21999.960000000003s)]
*  entity in a way. [[06:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22007.280000000002s)]
*  And also as a place of refuge for people who were trapped in the land of the devil. [[06:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22009.28s)]
*  It was the dualistic vision of geopolitics embraced by the new left radicals but wrapped [[06:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22014.68s)]
*  up in spiritual trappings and served to a religious audience. [[06:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22019.68s)]
*  One temple member Gene Clancy remembered, quote, When I was first in Redwood Valley, [[06:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22025.199999999997s)]
*  Jim called me out. [[06:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22030.36s)]
*  He said, You say you don't like me because I talked bad about Jesus, but really you don't [[06:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22031.36s)]
*  like me because I'm a socialist. [[06:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22035.86s)]
*  And he had me. [[06:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22037.52s)]

*  What he was saying is that all that Christianity stuff is passe. [[06:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22045.08s)]
*  The higher good is socialism. [[06:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22050.0s)]

*  What is being supplanted is your theology, your worldview. [[06:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22063.08s)]
*  So when it comes to turning your glance away from the things that are going on, you've [[06:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22066.72s)]
*  already made your compromise. [[06:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22071.56s)]

*  I was born into capitalist sin. [[06:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22076.600000000002s)]
*  I was born into racist sin. [[06:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22078.84s)]

*  Abuse happened. [[06:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22097.32s)]
*  In my mind, it happened because we're in this limbo, this purgatory, this hell. [[06:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22098.32s)]
*  And we're given this standard which those of us who really believed tried our darnedest [[06:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22104.960000000003s)]

*  Another way that the church began to make serious money was by encouraging more and [[06:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22140.679999999997s)]
*  more people to live communally. [[06:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22146.0s)]
*  Members who were good with children were assigned to large houses and the temple got [[06:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22149.4s)]
*  certified to take in foster kids. [[06:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22154.280000000002s)]
*  The state would pay the church for each orphan that it cared for. [[06:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22157.22s)]
*  Members who worked full time for the church were technically unemployed and they would [[06:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22161.280000000002s)]
*  live communally and they would collect welfare and that money went to the church. [[06:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22165.88s)]
*  A large number of elderly folks gave up their houses if they owned them and moved into the [[06:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22171.640000000003s)]

*  the person's social security check and in return the church would take care of all their [[06:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22180.68s)]

*  As it had for Father Divine, the communal living arrangement was a huge moneymaker for [[06:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22187.8s)]
*  Jim Jones. [[06:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22191.34s)]
*  All that extra money allowed them to provide services to people who otherwise would have [[06:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22193.48s)]
*  had nothing at all. [[06:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22197.16s)]
*  Phil Tracy was one of the journalists who in the end would help bring down people's [[06:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22199.0s)]
*  temple at the end of its life. [[06:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22202.92s)]
*  He wrote about this. [[06:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22206.839999999997s)]
*  This is a guy who's not sympathetic to the temple obviously but later on he discussed [[06:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22207.839999999997s)]
*  the work that Jim Jones was managing in the community. [[06:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22213.48s)]
*  He was feeding 600, 700, 800 people a night in shifts and they had access to things that [[06:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22218.079999999998s)]
*  as individual families these poor people never would have had access to. [[06:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22224.76s)]
*  They had whirlpools and sonograms. [[06:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22229.36s)]
*  I'm talking about in the 70s, right? [[06:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22231.56s)]
*  This was not ordinary equipment at that time. [[06:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22233.84s)]
*  What Jones was doing was he was using economy of scale, the buttresses economics, by connecting [[06:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22237.4s)]
*  into that money from the state of California that it would give to foster care homes. [[06:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22242.96s)]
*  Jones eventually developed political connections and he had a track record from Indiana and [[06:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22248.28s)]
*  then in California. [[06:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22252.440000000002s)]
*  They've been doing this for years. [[06:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22253.440000000002s)]
*  I mean the state was paying foster parents an average of $5 a night for supper but normally [[06:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22255.56s)]
*  that went to individual parents looking after a handful of kids at most. [[06:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22260.88s)]
*  Jones was feeding them for 55 cents and the difference went into people's temples coffers. [[06:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22265.640000000003s)]
*  He also had a bunch of old people who were on social security and who couldn't probably [[06:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22271.480000000003s)]
*  live very well as individuals because of the rent involved but if he warehoused them in [[06:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22275.24s)]
*  these homes that he had, well he can make a lot of money that way. [[06:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22279.56s)]
*  Social security became a pretty big part of his income. [[06:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22283.66s)]
*  People were packed in tight but for a lot of the older people who took him up on the [[06:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22288.22s)]
*  offer it really was a big improvement in their lives. [[06:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22292.66s)]
*  Imagine you're one of those old black ladies I mentioned earlier, 70, 80 years old. [[06:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22297.02s)]
*  You're born into the Jim Crow South in the 1890s. [[06:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22303.579999999998s)]
*  If you're 80 in 1970 and you're in the temple, you're born in 1890. [[06:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22307.899999999998s)]

*  You come out with your husband in one of the migration waves looking for work in California. [[06:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22316.3s)]
*  Maybe like a lot of black migrants your husband ends up finding a job working the docks at [[06:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22323.1s)]
*  the Oakland port and living where a lot of them did in the neighborhood adjacent. [[06:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22327.14s)]
*  Life in an Oakland ghetto does not turn out to be much easier than it was in the South. [[06:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22333.460000000003s)]
*  By now you're an old lady, your husband's dead, your kids, maybe they're in jail, maybe [[06:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22338.260000000002s)]
*  they're still around but the ghetto's not an easy place for people to live and you still [[06:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22346.06s)]
*  live in the old house that you guys bought but now the neighborhood has turned into a [[06:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22353.460000000003s)]
*  gang and drug infested blight. [[06:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22357.58s)]

*  You spend most of your time alone and then you come into one of these communal homes [[06:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22363.5s)]
*  run by the temple and you've got friends, other women like yourself and people are really [[06:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22367.54s)]
*  kind, not like hospital staff nice but actually friendly. [[06:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22372.82s)]
*  They want to be your friend and some of the foster kids are there and you help take care [[06:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22377.7s)]
*  of them. [[06:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22382.14s)]

*  This lady who maybe was 50 already when she left the Jim Crow South, just to find herself [[06:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22389.62s)]
*  in an all black ghetto, she's in this temple home helping take care of little white kids [[06:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22395.579999999998s)]

*  Or maybe it's a child of one of the temple women who drops her child off while she's [[06:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22406.86s)]
*  at work and when she gets back to pick up the child this white woman is just genuinely [[06:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22411.1s)]

*  There's no formality to it. [[06:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22416.98s)]

*  when they found this place and it was as if they had found something that they [[06:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22439.739999999998s)]

*  I'm telling you right now for all of the problems that this church had and it is going to get [[06:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22461.02s)]

*  out of the way of the truck at the very end. [[06:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22490.18s)]

*  It's not a story. [[06:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22581.46s)]
*  This is something that they took down from the testimony of a real black woman who was [[06:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22583.22s)]
*  born in 1903 and found herself in People's Temple. [[06:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22589.140000000003s)]
*  Go back to it. [[06:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22594.02s)]
*  During the Depression I worked for 75 cents a day. [[06:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22598.06s)]
*  My mother was a very smart and shifty woman. [[06:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22601.5s)]
*  She had to be. [[06:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22603.9s)]
*  I remember how we had to carry wood to keep the school warm. [[06:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22605.7s)]

*  They said he was looking in a window. [[06:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22612.24s)]
*  They took him out and castrated him. [[06:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22614.760000000002s)]
*  The people were afraid to talk. [[06:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22617.280000000002s)]
*  The doctor didn't do anything about it. [[06:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22619.440000000002s)]
*  There was no hospital. [[06:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22621.08s)]
*  And so he died. [[06:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22622.08s)]
*  My father had his horse taken from him that he had worked and saved for because my sister [[06:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22625.04s)]

*  We had to work extra hard to get money for the barest essentials. [[06:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22631.68s)]
*  They only gave dad 50 dollars to get his crop started. [[06:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22635.4s)]
*  I had to walk five miles each way to school. [[06:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22639.12s)]
*  I had to wade through icy water. [[06:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22642.92s)]
*  There was no way around. [[06:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22644.399999999998s)]
*  In school I remember brutal beatings. [[06:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22646.36s)]
*  There were lynchings. [[06:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22649.039999999997s)]
*  I had blocked it out." [[06:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22650.64s)]
*  And her son Eugene said that he never thought a place like the temple existed until he found [[06:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22655.6s)]
*  it. [[06:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22660.92s)]
*  And he noticed that if you worked hard then everybody liked you. [[06:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22661.92s)]
*  And so he worked hard. [[06:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22665.559999999998s)]
*  And everybody liked him. [[06:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22666.92s)]
*  And he liked them. [[06:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22667.92s)]
*  The church put him through school. [[06:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22669.76s)]
*  One member asked for some help publishing the temple newsletter. [[06:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22671.879999999997s)]
*  And so Eugene volunteered. [[06:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22675.679999999997s)]
*  And the guy took his time with him and taught him all the ins and outs of offset printing. [[06:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22677.12s)]
*  While they were doing that, he saw Eugene checking out some of the cameras that they [[06:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22681.839999999997s)]
*  used to take pictures to the newsletter. [[06:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22685.3s)]
*  And so he brought Eugene to the photographer and introduced them. [[06:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22687.539999999997s)]
*  And the photographer showed him all the stuff he knew about photography. [[06:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22690.16s)]
*  He was interested in learning mechanics. [[06:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22694.440000000002s)]
*  And when he went down to the church mechanics shop, the boys down there welcomed him and [[06:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22696.920000000002s)]

*  Eugene Smith, of all people, knows the dark side of Jonestown. [[06:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22704.52s)]
*  But he would smile. [[06:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22708.68s)]
*  It was a sad smile. [[06:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22710.32s)]
*  But he would smile when he told these stories. [[06:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=22711.600000000002s)]

*  between them arguing. [[06:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23033.6s)]
*  When my father threw hot grease at my mother it hit me, burning me so badly that I still [[06:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23036.36s)]
*  have the permanent scars of burn damage on my face, neck, mouth and ears. [[06:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23041.2s)]
*  My parents deserted me soon after and the welfare system took over my life. [[06:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23049.54s)]
*  At the age of one year I had the unhappy pleasure of coming into contact with a woman by the [[06:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23054.3s)]
*  name of Alice Moten, better known to me as the Devil. [[06:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23060.9s)]
*  Life with her in Indianapolis, Indiana was hell. [[06:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23066.18s)]
*  By the time I reached five my musical talent was being exploited. [[06:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23070.46s)]
*  Most of my life those years was spent staying up night after night practicing piano until [[06:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23075.78s)]
*  it was time to go to school the next morning or being beat for not practicing. [[06:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23080.14s)]
*  As a result I failed many of my school years and served my time in a special education [[06:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23086.059999999998s)]
*  class for the retarded which threw me far behind in school for the rest of my life. [[06:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23090.44s)]
*  I can't remember how old I was when I attempted to commit suicide. [[06:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23098.14s)]
*  I tried hanging a rope around the water pipe and putting my neck in the noose. [[06:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23102.58s)]
*  I stood on a chair and jumped but the pipe broke. [[06:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23107.26s)]
*  I felt my life was destined to become nothing and I was right. [[06:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23111.94s)]
*  I lost my job because of coming to work drunk or high on diet pills and marijuana. [[06:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23117.74s)]
*  I met this one young man I thought was nice and started dating him. [[06:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23123.5s)]
*  I was dumber than cow shit. [[06:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23127.54s)]
*  I fell for any line that was nice and sweet. [[06:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23129.9s)]
*  I started meeting different people, the wrong people who I thought were my friends and liked me. [[06:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23133.06s)]
*  We'd get high and sell joints and nickel bags right all night long until one day I saw a [[06:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23139.420000000002s)]
*  friend stick herself with one of those needles and I saw how she got hooked. [[06:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23144.66s)]
*  I looked up to her. [[06:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23149.3s)]
*  She was 31 and I was 19. [[06:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23151.2s)]
*  I thought maybe if I got an older guy maybe he might be settled and maybe things can change. [[06:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23154.46s)]
*  I went with a man. [[06:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23160.26s)]
*  He was about 40. [[06:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23161.46s)]
*  He had a good paying job as a bricklayer. [[06:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23163.3s)]
*  You know when you're a black man in a poor community a bricklaying job is considered [[06:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23166.539999999997s)]
*  good position and money. [[06:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23169.859999999997s)]
*  I found out that he was a half-stepping pimp who hustled women on the side. [[06:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23172.94s)]
*  He didn't let on to me that he was a pimp and I was too dumb to realize it. [[06:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23177.26s)]
*  He did set me up with a job at Marion County Hospital in Indianapolis and I was doing pretty [[06:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23182.18s)]
*  good until I started drinking and staying out late. [[06:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23186.82s)]
*  One night he wanted me to stay home and I told him to kiss my ass. [[06:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23191.260000000002s)]
*  He beat me up until I couldn't see out of my eyes. [[06:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23195.02s)]
*  I called in sick the next morning and she says, [[06:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23198.66s)]
*  Well, Miss Wilkinson, if you can't come in then we can't use you. [[06:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23200.94s)]
*  I really started letting my whole self fall down after that. [[06:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23206.1s)]
*  I took an overdose of speed and had to be rushed to General Hospital to have my stomach pumped. [[06:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23210.18s)]
*  I was 20 years old. [[06:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23215.620000000003s)]
*  I continued to stay out in the streets getting into more things than I could handle. [[06:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23218.780000000002s)]
*  During my childhood my stepmother came in contact with People's Temple and Jim Jones. [[06:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23224.22s)]
*  I met some of the Temple children who all befriended me including Jim's children. [[06:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23229.54s)]
*  They were children of every race and they were really nice to me. [[06:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23234.940000000002s)]
*  I thought a lot of Jim because he was living in the middle of a black neighborhood in the [[06:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23239.14s)]
*  heart of the ghetto on 13th and Broadway in Indianapolis. [[06:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23242.38s)]
*  Also that his adopted black son was named after him, Jimmy Jr. [[06:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23246.98s)]
*  The Jones family had a lot of pets and all of them, especially Jim, were really kind [[06:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23252.42s)]
*  to me. [[06:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23256.54s)]
*  This is the only recollection of any happiness in my entire childhood. [[06:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23258.5s)]
*  But Jim and his family went away and during the time I was separated from them I left [[06:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23264.26s)]
*  home and got really messed up and messed over. [[06:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23268.46s)]
*  When Jim returned he came to Indiana and held a meeting. [[06:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23272.739999999998s)]
*  I didn't know right away that Jim and his family had since moved to California. [[06:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23276.94s)]
*  Jim didn't even ask me if I had any money. [[06:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23282.18s)]
*  When I told him what had been happening in my life and now she's weeping. [[06:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23286.02s)]
*  He asked me to come to California with them. [[06:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23293.3s)]
*  As I sat on the beautiful Greyhound bus Jim had bought for his people, I looked out the [[06:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23297.02s)]
*  window and said goodbye to Indiana. [[06:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23306.420000000002s)]
*  Goodbye to the pain and misery and knowing I never ever had to look at that life anymore. [[06:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qxqa8HGlY&t=23310.06s)]
