# What a Second Biden Term Would Look Like
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [March 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYfjB_3Ylkc)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  So we are talking on Friday morning.
*  It's March 8th.
*  It is the morning after Joe Biden's State of the Union, which was a raucous, enthusiastic
*  affair.
*  And we thought we'd do a kind of bigger picture episode talking through a bit of State of
*  the Union and more broadly what the State of the Union was beginning to preview, which
*  is what Joe Biden's second term would look like, what his pitch in 2024 for that second
*  term will look like, and then what actually that second term will look like, which I've
*  also been doing a fair amount of separate reporting on.
*  So I'm joined, as I often am in these days, by my illustrious editor, Aaron Redica.
*  Aaron, thank you for being here.
*  You're welcome.
*  So where do you want to begin?
*  Well, the audience can't see it, but I have brought you a replica of a medieval hair shirt
*  to wear to mortify yourself after the State of the Union.
*  You know why, but I'm going to ask you about it anyway.
*  Many people actually were tweeting away and talking about how Biden's performance during
*  the State of the Union was essentially a refutation of your argument from a few weeks
*  ago that he should, in fact, step aside from the campaign.
*  So could you talk a little bit about how you felt watching it and what you think about
*  that idea?
*  I mean, the way I felt watching it was excited to see Joe Biden giving a really great State
*  of the Union.
*  I think it would truly be like the height of pundit egotism.
*  To be like, the important thing about this election is whether it proves my prior takes
*  right or wrong.
*  Look, the argument of that piece is that at the time I wrote it, Joe Biden was not performing
*  into the campaign well.
*  He was doing very little campaigning, doing very, very few interviews, doing relatively
*  few appearances.
*  The ones he was doing were turning out to be low energy affairs when he was going out
*  to give that big press conference.
*  It both did not go well on its own terms.
*  And then he badly messed up the question of how to reassure people about his memory.
*  They were skipping things like the Super Bowl interview.
*  And the argument of that piece is that Biden was not showing that he is up for this campaign.
*  And if he can't be up for an aggressive campaign, he should not run.
*  Look, if the Joe Biden we get is a Joe Biden of the State of the Union, because that was
*  genuinely I think an excellent State of the Union.
*  It was surprising in a bunch of different ways and we can talk about them, but it was
*  very, very well delivered, very high energy.
*  I've not seen that Joe Biden in a while.
*  Now, why he was so much better there than he's been in a bunch of other formats I've
*  seen him, including very structured formats a campaign has set up for him.
*  I mean, go look at the kind of social media clips they have been circulating.
*  I don't really know.
*  And I don't really care.
*  The absolute best thing, easiest thing here is it Joe Biden kind of shook the cobwebs
*  off and is going to campaign like that from here until November.
*  And if he does that, and in the end he beats Donald Trump by five, and people want to say
*  my piece was stupid and alarmist, I will happily say my piece was stupid and alarmist and I
*  was wrong.
*  And that would be a great outcome.
*  But it was really quite good speech.
*  And Biden wasn't just energized.
*  He was very, very quick on his feet.
*  And he had something I haven't seen from him in a while, which is something I've associated
*  with him throughout his almost entire political career.
*  A kind of joy, a happy warrior affect.
*  He seemed delighted to be up there.
*  He seemed to be having fun sparring with the Republicans, making fun of Lindsey Graham.
*  I mean, it was a very bare knuckled partisan state of the union for what that affair typically
*  is.
*  But Biden didn't seem to be plotting through it.
*  There was a real intense energy to him.
*  So there's a long time between here and the election, but I hope that guy keeps showing
*  up.
*  And I think the reason I think he's been so good just from having conversations even
*  with top Democrats since it is I think he, at least for now, quieted a lot of the fears,
*  right?
*  People needed to see a performance like that from him and they did.
*  What's funny about that is that the state of the union last year was supposed to be
*  that moment.
*  They were supposed to get crushed in the midterms.
*  They did not get crushed in the midterms.
*  He then did incredibly well in the state of the union in 2023.
*  Everyone calmed down.
*  Then all the questions started again.
*  Now he's done well in the state of the union in 2024.
*  What do you think they can do to make that a more permanent change and not just he's
*  good when he goes to Congress?
*  Look, I don't know Joe Biden the way they know Joe Biden.
*  I don't really understand the variance in his public performance.
*  It isn't that people were inventing the thing that happened between the two state of the
*  unions.
*  The amount of conversation even among top Democrats who were not talking about this
*  in public was very high.
*  People who were out there with him saw him.
*  His style had become oftentimes very listless, what sometimes gets called low energy.
*  And then he really, really, really brought it last night.
*  The reason I am not fully comforted is an election is long.
*  both do is campaign well at the median event, but also avoid things that become a crystallizing
*  moment of fears about you.
*  And I don't know that having given a good state of the union fully comforts me because
*  I don't really kind of understand what separates his good performances from his bad ones that
*  nobody needs to worry anymore.
*  But I think the thing he proved last night is that he is still capable of extremely high
*  performance.
*  The thing he showed in that initial piece was not that he's doing a poor job or not
*  capable of doing the presidency, but that lately he has not been proven capable of performing
*  the presidency, performing the campaign, that the skills you need as a campaigner are different.
*  The thing he did in the state of the union, which more than any state of the union I've
*  seen was a campaign speech.
*  I mean, this was much more of a campaign speech than you typically get at that particular
*  event.
*  He showed the skills of a campaigner.
*  If he could keep showing that, then my piece was simply wrong and I will happily own that.
*  So there's been a tremendous amount of chatter about Trump 2025.
*  In our own newspaper, Maggie Haberman and Charlie Savage and Jonathan Swan have had
*  an incredible series about what they expect his administration to look like.
*  Our own Carlos Lozada had a great piece about Heritage Foundation's project 2025.
*  There's been comparatively little discussion of Biden 2025, and that's something that I
*  really want to talk about today.
*  There was not so much about that last night.
*  There were pieces of it, little programs, more like triangulation type bits.
*  But what do you see as the essential elements of a Biden second administration as it looks
*  now?
*  So I've been doing a bunch of reporting about this.
*  I was at the White House not long ago talking to a bunch of people before the state of the
*  union about what was the agenda going to be?
*  I was struck talking to people across different issue areas, how much the first thing I heard
*  was finish the job.
*  And in a way that makes sense, because if you think about the major bills of Biden's
*  first term, the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the Chips
*  and Science Act, those are all long multi-year efforts to change America's built environment
*  in one way or the other.
*  And changing the built environment, as I report on a lot, is slow going, particularly in this
*  country.
*  And so I mean, the Chips and Science Act, one of its core things it's doing is giving
*  thirty nine billion dollars to semiconductor manufacturing firms to build fabs, the big
*  factories here.
*  That is just begin giving its initial grants.
*  They've given only a tiny fraction of the money.
*  The word is we're going to be hearing more such announcements soon.
*  So helping to oversee that, trying to clear, Gene Raimondo, the Secretary of Commerce,
*  has been trying to get Congress to exempt these projects from environmental permitting
*  review.
*  She says that'll add years, which I think raises a bunch of questions about what should
*  and should not go through environmental permitting review.
*  But trying to make that actually successful, that's a real project.
*  The IRA, right?
*  I mean, that is trying to do a huge upheaval of the built landscape.
*  Some parts of that are going really well.
*  We are installing solar faster than we had anticipated or hoped.
*  Wind is coming in well below expectations.
*  So solar is faster.
*  Wind is slower.
*  This question, particularly offshore wind, is proving to be a problem.
*  Trying to figure out how to unkink that, that's a lot of work.
*  Building that nationwide EV charging system, which has not yet been built, but is funded
*  in the IRA, that's a big project.
*  Then all of that needs to plug into a grid that is actually giving you not dirty energy
*  from coal or certain kinds of natural gas or whatever, but is giving you clean energy.
*  The IRA is not going to hit its goals if they can't figure out how to make it easier and
*  faster to build interstate electricity transmission lines.
*  If they aren't able then to get that clean energy generated from where it is generated
*  to where the car plugs in or where the heat pump plugs in or where whatever it is plugs
*  in, then you didn't solve the problem.
*  So one thing that I think they are pretty clear-eyed about is a huge amount of their
*  agenda requires a huge amount of implementation and oversight.
*  And if they lost the White House, they would not be able to do that implementation and
*  oversight and in fact, probably the Trump administration, number two, would throw a
*  huge amount of sand in the gears of that, maybe roll it back altogether.
*  So that's a place where I actually do think a lot of the second term agenda in their minds
*  has to do with making their first term agenda into a success.
*  They passed the bills, but they have not actually yet changed the built environment.
*  Then there are a couple other, I think, big pieces of it.
*  You did hear a fair amount last night about Roe or Dobbs is maybe the better way to put
*  it.
*  It is a little less clear to me what they're actually promising there.
*  So they say, send us a bill to codify Roe.
*  They don't have the votes for that now, right?
*  Republicans control the House.
*  But even if they had control of the House and Senate, they're not going to have the
*  votes because you can't do that in budget reconciliation.
*  So you need either 60 votes to get around the filibuster or you need 51 votes to get
*  rid of the filibuster or create a filibuster exemption.
*  Very, very unlikely Democrats have either of those things in the Senate.
*  But simply by being there, they have something that they will lose if Donald Trump came into
*  office, which is, as we talked about on the last episode we did, which is about the way
*  the different state policies on abortion are colliding now.
*  There is a huge amount of effort and it would go up to the top of the Trump administration
*  if they won to make it illegal, possibly to even use, but definitely to send these
*  abortion pills, which have become the dominant ways that abortions are happening in the country.
*  And the reason that DOBS has not led to quite the restriction in abortion access that its
*  proponents thought it would.
*  If Trump is elected, they have all kinds of plans to do away with that, including potentially
*  saying the FDA wrongly approved Miffl-Prestone when it was evaluated the first time.
*  So long as Biden is there and is appointing the FDA commissioner, that's not going to
*  happen.
*  So that is in practice a very big deal.
*  And then I guess we will talk about this, but Biden is not going to wrap up the major
*  foreign policy crises or projects of his presidency in his first term.
*  There's going to be no end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  It seems unlikely to me they'll be able to execute the pivot they want to execute on
*  grand deal where Israel gets recognition from Saudi Arabia in return for recognizing a Palestinian
*  state.
*  That's a much bigger project.
*  And then there's, of course, the geostrategic competition with China.
*  And so that would be a huge part of a second term, too.
*  And all those things, obviously, were big parts of the speech.
*  Okay, I'm going to take those one at a time and just go in the order that you did.
*  Implementation administration.
*  How do those become transformation?
*  Obama famously criticized Clinton for not transforming America the way Reagan had.
*  If Biden has eight years in office, looking back from Biden 2029, does the kind of work
*  that you're talking about finishing the job on the CHIPS Act and IRA transform the landscape
*  of America so much that actually he's literally transformed the United States?
*  And so he will be thought of that way and seen that way and have done what he wants
*  to do?
*  Or is that, even though it's an enormous project, too small a bore to actually change the way
*  the United States operates?
*  I think there are two levels to this.
*  Let's take level one in the hypothetical where he wins a second term and all these policies
*  work because that's an asterisk.
*  But if they do, then yes, I think so.
*  Take Obama as the example here, right?
*  Obama wins two terms.
*  I don't think most people can name very much legislation passed in Obama's second term.
*  They did do some things.
*  I mean, they had a huge education reform bill which was passed relatively quietly and mattered
*  quite a bit as a kind of update and reauthorization and transformation of No Child Left Behind.
*  But I don't think people think of that as transformative.
*  What they think of as transformative about Obama are things like the Affordable Care
*  Act, the investments made during the stimulus, the Dodd-Frank financial reforms.
*  I mean, those were all first term bills.
*  I think Biden is likely to look similarly.
*  I mean, one reason is the map for Democrats in the Senate is just god awful in 2024.
*  Even if Biden wins and does really well, it is a very tough road in a way that it wasn't
*  even in 2022 to keep the Senate.
*  So they're going to lose the West Virginia seat.
*  Joe Manchin is retiring.
*  They're not going to keep that seat.
*  And they have a bunch of other...
*  That brings them just for clarity to 50, right?
*  That would bring them to 50.
*  Tester's got to win.
*  They got to win in Nevada.
*  There are a bunch of places Republicans could easily pick up a seat and not many places
*  where Democrats could easily pick up a seat.
*  So Democrats basically have to run the table.
*  Not completely impossible, but unlikely.
*  So that's one dimension of this.
*  I do think though, that if these policies worked, if at the end of Joe Biden's second
*  term you look around and there is a nationwide, like coast to coast, real electric vehicle
*  charging structure, such that you can truly have the electric vehicle revolution without
*  people being limited by range anxiety and the feeling that they couldn't make an interstate
*  drive feeling safe about it, that's a very big deal.
*  If the percentage of energy generated from clean sources skyrockets, that's actually
*  a very, very big deal, right?
*  And including if solar and wind costs come down as part of that.
*  If some of the deeper investments they're making and things like green hydrogen, right,
*  they have a lot of more long shot investments happening in there.
*  Trying to decarbonize industrial buildings, like that isn't super sexy, but if they are
*  able to build these innovation hubs and able to get these things moving and get people
*  using heat pumps, all that is a really big deal.
*  I mean, in a very literal way, if they succeed, the appliances that people have in their homes
*  are going to be different.
*  They are going to have heat pumps and not gas furnaces.
*  The cars they have in their driveways are going to be different, right?
*  That would actually be quite literally transformational.
*  And then of course, there's chips and science, which I mean, I think the big thing people
*  know there if they know anything is a semiconductor effort.
*  If we're able to onshore advanced semiconductor manufacturing, which is a very big if, that
*  would be a huge deal, right?
*  That is, I think, probably the single most important and strategically critical industry
*  of the 21st century.
*  Then you have the question of will all this work?
*  And all of these to achieve what they need to achieve still have pretty big roadblocks.
*  The way I would put this is that Democrats have been very good at addition and not very
*  good at subtraction.
*  Tyler Cowen, who's a more right leaning economist at George Mason University, he had a good
*  Bloomberg column on this where he was skeptical.
*  He was saying it's too early to know if biodynamics is going to work.
*  And I thought his best line in that column was what they have not done is really any
*  deregulation.
*  And I do think that's true.
*  So take chips and science, they need a huge amount of workforce to make that work.
*  We do not have enough people who know how to do a semiconductor, the manufacturing
*  and building of semiconductor facilities.
*  And so the ones we are building are coming in way over cost and are getting delayed and
*  delayed and delayed.
*  And we don't have enough people who know how to run those facilities.
*  They have all kinds of ideas in the regulations they've built around that to try to bring
*  more women and minorities into construction there.
*  They have ideas about how to train workforces and community colleges, and it's all laudable
*  stuff.
*  But if you want to serve the workforce problem fast, what you would do is create a visa pathway
*  for skilled workers on these issues from other countries.
*  We should just be bringing in a lot of people from South Korea and Japan.
*  So you can deregulate that and bring people in if you were able to get the votes on it.
*  Similarly, the environmental permitting is proving to be a very, very big problem on
*  semiconductors.
*  Again, Raimondo is trying to get the House and the Senate to pass something exempting
*  agenda from the environmental bills like NEPA.
*  That failed in the House.
*  They were not able to get that done.
*  Similarly, the permitting is a big problem on the Inflation Reduction Act.
*  They want to do all of this building and all this building, which is built to help the
*  environment, can all be sued under its environmental impact.
*  I've done a huge amount of reporting on this in recent years.
*  It's a big theme of my coming book.
*  And I mean, even something as simple as congestion pricing in New York City, where you're just
*  hanging sensors on poles to charge cars for driving into New York City, that was tied
*  up in years of environmental assessment.
*  And so they really do have a problem here.
*  One place where I would ding the Biden administration is they've been hiding behind other people
*  in their effort to address this.
*  They sort of hid behind Joe Manchin's proposals here, right?
*  Manchin was demanding this package and then they put some stuff they liked into the package.
*  Then they tried to sort of do it in this weird debt ceiling deal.
*  What they have never done, what they did not do at the State of the Union is come out
*  and say, this is our agenda for building back faster.
*  We have passed our agenda for building back better.
*  Here's how we are going to do it faster.
*  Here are the ways we are going to unshackle government to reach its goals more quickly.
*  Coalitionally, that's very hard for them.
*  It puts them crosswise with environmental groups, with various kinds of social justice
*  groups.
*  Now you have begun to see some movement here.
*  There has been a movement among some House Democrats to come up with a permitting reform
*  bill of their own.
*  I think that has some good aspects and some not as good aspects.
*  But that's interesting, right?
*  That's a move you haven't seen really before Democrats beginning to engage on this.
*  So yes, if everything they have passed worked, I think that would be remembered as genuinely
*  transformational.
*  Whether the things they have passed will work, that remains to be seen and is not simply
*  an outcome on autopilot.
*  One thing that they are doing that is sort of stealth Roosevelt is having programs that
*  are not just one group or another.
*  The Republicans are always trying to make it seem like this is for climate lunatics
*  or whatever, but actually the number of people who are affected by this is in the hundreds
*  of thousands, if not millions, for all of these programs.
*  They're not specifically for the poor.
*  They're not specifically for any particular group and they're more of a rising tide lifts
*  all boats kind of structure, which I think is interesting.
*  Do you have thoughts about the sort of politics of that?
*  I don't think that is actually so different.
*  I mean, Obamacare was also a race neutral bill and I think that reflects how Clinton
*  governed.
*  I think it reflects how Obama governed and I think it reflects how Joe Biden governed.
*  Inside these bills, there is a lot of effort to address certain kinds of equity.
*  If you look inside the guts of all of these proposals, you'll find things about how different
*  bids are getting evaluated and how different grants are getting given out and the bonus
*  addition on the money.
*  If you're building this in a disadvantaged community, there's actually quite a lot on
*  that.
*  I think more than people realize, but that also goes backwards.
*  So I've been doing a bunch of reporting for both my book and for a piece on California
*  high speed rail.
*  One of the things people in California wonder a lot about is why did they start building
*  this line in the central valley, Bakersfield to Merced, which is currently all they have
*  any real plans to build or finish, which is not where you would build high speed rail.
*  The population centers are not nearly dense enough to make that work.
*  One of the reasons is that when the California high speed rail authority tried to get that
*  federal money that Barack Obama talked about a lot in the stimulus and Barack Obama talked
*  endlessly there about high speed rail across the country, but particularly in California
*  as one of the signature reinvestment dimensions of the stimulus, one of the signature projects.
*  But to actually apply for the program, it wasn't just can you build some high speed
*  rail?
*  It had these preferences, including for things that would handle or clean up air pollution
*  in disadvantaged communities.
*  And so if you wanted to look for where you had really bad air pollution in your disadvantaged
*  community, you're looking at things like Fresno, California.
*  And so the actual money that came from the feds in the stimulus was in a way people did
*  not realize actually not just for high speed rail, but was to also hit these other equity
*  markers.
*  And so that led to them beginning this bill in a place that in terms of the political
*  economy of it doesn't make a ton of sense.
*  There are other things that might be good about it, like it's a little bit flatter and
*  straighter for you to test your trains.
*  But it's a I think politically a huge problem for high speed rail that it has started in
*  the politically weakest part of California.
*  You know, you got a high speed rail near L.A.
*  It's like great.
*  You have it from Bakersfield to Merced.
*  People like why inside these bills?
*  There is a lot of that.
*  Some of it, of course, Biden is bragging about.
*  Right.
*  You talked about by American and you talked about the ways in which that has not been
*  enforced even by recent Democratic administrations.
*  And there are people who care about climate who think that's a bad idea that we should
*  be just trying to get as much climate infrastructure as cheap as we possibly can, as quickly as
*  we possibly can and trying to combine that with the construction and preference of an
*  American supply chain.
*  Even if that is good political economy, even if it sounds good in the end won't be good
*  because it's going to slow you down.
*  It's going to raise prices and people aren't going to like or benefit from the program
*  the way they otherwise would.
*  People like low prices for things.
*  But in terms of the sort of macro impact of the bills, yeah, I mean, they're trying to
*  build a nationwide electric vehicle charger station.
*  I think in a direct way, that's probably going to be regressive for a while because electric
*  vehicles are somewhat more expensive.
*  But in a long term way, in terms of if it actually works to reduce air pollution and
*  to help with global warming, that helps everybody and helps people in a progressive way.
*  I think the way they do this, which is universal bills that inside of them have significant
*  equity considerations is pretty standard at this point for Democratic lawmaking.
*  On Dobson Row, Biden was making the case last night that there's a larger issue of freedom
*  here.
*  Obviously, it's a tremendous issue of freedom in its own right.
*  But he was also making the case that it was a bigger issue tied to larger issues of freedom
*  in the United States.
*  And I'm wondering what your thinking is on how that is going to play out in 2025 and
*  further as they're developing their agenda in the second administration.
*  That question makes me think of an interesting detail in the profile that Evan Osnos did
*  in a very recent New Yorker where he got some time with Biden in the Oval Office.
*  Biden has a really interesting and complex history on abortion.
*  He opposes the initial row decision.
*  He's a moderate Catholic Democrat at the time that it happens and moderate Catholic Democrats
*  in general were pro-life.
*  Throughout his career, he has then largely tried to protect abortion rights.
*  He's got a pretty good record on that.
*  But as I always said, and I don't think this is actually bad politics, and I think it is
*  authentic to him that he is personally uncomfortable with it.
*  And Osnos is talking about a bit of this history.
*  And he notes then that when the decision came down, that Biden's reaction inside the White
*  House, as at least it has been reported, was, we're just going to roll back 50 years of
*  rights now?
*  And he experienced it.
*  And I think this is true for a lot of people, even people who may not personally be that
*  with abortion, is as a rollback of rights, that however you feel about abortion, you
*  shouldn't be taking the choice away from people.
*  I mean, this is the power and potency of the framing of choice.
*  People believe in row or this set of rights.
*  The way they understand themselves is not pro-abortion typically.
*  It's pro-bodily autonomy.
*  I think that Biden is doing a fairly good job talking about it in those terms.
*  I don't know about the kind of connection to this other set of things, right?
*  There was a sort of effort in framing at the beginning of the speech to sort of say, you've
*  got Putin on the march in Ukraine, and he's not going to stop there.
*  You had an assault on this chamber, the Capitol, on January 6.
*  And Donald Trump and that movement are not going to stop there.
*  And you've had an assault on rights from Trump appointed judges, like on Dobs, and that movement
*  is not going to stop there.
*  I don't necessarily disagree with any of this.
*  It was not the framing of their message in the State of the Union that I found most compelling.
*  I mean, I think that the simple abortion argument is very, very compelling and very true.
*  I don't think that trying to make everything into one issue tends to work.
*  I think that's something that appeals more to what the political scientists would call
*  highly ideological thinkers than to just normal people who mostly don't really feel that what
*  the Supreme Court did on Dobs and what Putin is doing in Ukraine are all kind of part of
*  the same bucket.
*  The Biden team wants to make this election about freedom.
*  To some degree, I think that's going to resonate, freedom and democracy.
*  It is definitely a motivating argument to voters.
*  And I think what is very clear from every speech Joe Biden gives, from every report
*  we get about Joe Biden, is that it is motivating to Joe Biden personally.
*  I would not say that I hope it is the central framing of their campaign.
*  But again, I'm not like, I don't win campaigns.
*  So I don't think you should really care what I think about that.
*  And if we go back to the question of why was he so much more vibrant in the context last
*  night, maybe this is the thing that animates him and therefore it has to be the thing that
*  they pursue because it's what brings out his best self.
*  Right?
*  I mean, that could be part of it.
*  I don't know.
*  That may be, but I thought there was a great argument in the State of the Union.
*  And for me, just listening, the thing that hit the hardest and felt like it was solving
*  the biggest problem they had and was the most flexible of their arguments, which is midway
*  through when you began talking about the economy, they have been facing this problem for a while,
*  which is the economy by every measure and marker you can choose looks pretty damn good.
*  Hell of a lot better than anybody was expecting two years ago.
*  Inflation has come way back down.
*  There's a specific problem with grocery prices, which is very, very upsetting to people and
*  understandably so.
*  But overall inflation is way down.
*  There was no recession.
*  The labor market is very tight.
*  The markets have continued growing, particularly for the poorest Americans.
*  American GDP growth has been very strong.
*  If you compare us to other countries, we look incredibly strong.
*  You compare how we have grown since the pandemic to a bunch of major European countries, to
*  Canada, we're looking great.
*  And yet people are pretty unhappy about it.
*  And not only are they unhappy about it, they think Donald Trump is much better on the economy.
*  If you want to know the number I find scariest in the whole election, it is the size of Trump's
*  advantage on who do you trust to run the economy.
*  So on the one hand, you can imagine a version where they're trying to say, I feel your pain.
*  We have a lot of ideas here.
*  And on the other, you can imagine a version of actually you're wrong.
*  The economy is great.
*  What they did was he began to build this idea of a comeback America, right?
*  Biden says in the speech, America is seeing this huge comeback and it is the greatest
*  story never told.
*  Let's tell it here.
*  I think comeback America is a really good frame for them, because it does two things
*  simultaneously.
*  One, it allows them to make the argument for how far we have come.
*  And we really have come very far for how good the economy is given where it was a couple
*  of years ago.
*  And it allows them to keep space for the fact that we're not where we would like to be.
*  The fact that you're in a comeback, even a really great comeback, does not mean you've
*  won.
*  You can unroll the mission accomplished banner to use the old George W. Bush thing.
*  It does not require you to tell people that everything is great.
*  It is a way of making an argument about to be a dork about this, a trend and not a level.
*  And I have not heard them come up with a frame for how they talk about their own record in
*  a while.
*  When you go back to Biden's campaign kickoff speech at Valley Forge, it was, I thought,
*  a very strange speech in many ways to have a campaign kickoff speech that has nothing
*  about what you as president have done.
*  It's all about your predecessor.
*  And I think it's fine to make Donald Trump a big issue in this election.
*  He is a big issue in this election.
*  But you still have to run as the incumbent.
*  And the Comeback America framing Biden adopted last night was the strongest run as an incumbent
*  message.
*  I have heard from them by many, many, many miles.
*  Yeah, it's an interesting thing because people have been saying, oh, well, you know, he can't
*  run the way Reagan did in 84 as morning in America.
*  And he can't because, as we've discussed before on the show, like the kitchen table conversation
*  and the elite conversation are very divergent.
*  But the comeback argument does allow space for that because it allows, as you said, for
*  recognizing that there's still a lot that's not going right.
*  Right.
*  To insist to people that everything is fine would be politically suicidal, actually.
*  I think one of the challenges they've been facing, and people have been talking about
*  this pretty openly in this election, is that their sort of argument in 2020 was a kind
*  of return to normalcy, a return to stability.
*  And Trump has taken very direct aim of that argument.
*  He's been basically arguing that under Donald Trump, what you have got in is chaos.
*  Chaos in Ukraine, chaos in Israel, chaos on the border, chaos just in the country,
*  look at grocery prices, and I, the strong man, will return normalcy.
*  I will bring back order, right, which is for many people, a close cousin of normalcy.
*  And there's been this question of what they're going to do about that.
*  Like, no, no, no, you're the chaos candidate.
*  No, no, you're the chaos candidate.
*  And this is a place where I disagree with a lot of the media critiques.
*  I think the media has done a very good job reporting on January 6.
*  I think the media has done a very good job reporting on wild things Donald Trump says.
*  I think people know who Trump is.
*  Like, even if you look at the New York Times poll that came out recently, where Biden was
*  quite far down from Trump, a majority, 50-some percent of people believed Trump is guilty
*  of serious criminality.
*  Just some percentage of those people were going to vote for him anyway.
*  And it is not that it does not deserve reporting, but people know who Trump is.
*  The thing that I think they do not know or have somehow sort of forgotten is that he's
*  actually not good at running things, that Trump's management is chaotic, that he is
*  not good at running an economy, right, that by the time he left the economy, it was a
*  crap show.
*  And so I think it is actually quite important for Biden to do to Trump what Trump is trying
*  to do to Biden, which is take away what Trump's actual strength is.
*  Trump's actual strength is not that people have forgotten January 6.
*  Trump's actual strength is that people remember January of 2019, right?
*  His actual strength is people look back in a sort of rose-colored way, I think, and remember
*  kind of a good economy, that they are making more money, that inflation had not been high,
*  and then they do not really blame him for what came next.
*  You know, people have just memory hold the last year of the Trump administration, where
*  he mishandled COVID terribly, just absolutely terribly.
*  The economy was in tatters.
*  He was responding to a crisis in just the most bizarre, erratic, egotistical, callous
*  possible way.
*  And like, that's the mess Joe Biden inherited, like just like a total, absolute, chaotic
*  situation.
*  And they righted the ship.
*  And what I think the comeback economy idea does, or the comeback country idea does, is
*  it allows them first to remind people that we were coming back from something, that it
*  was not just like 2019 happened and now we're in 2024.
*  Like there was some stuff that occurred in between 2019 and 2024, and Donald Trump was
*  president during it.
*  And Comeback America is a good way of combining an argument about how much Joe Biden has done
*  with a constant reminder of what it was Trump left.
*  And you want to run at your opponent's strength, like not just at their weakness.
*  Yeah, there's so many things that are fascinating about this whole situation.
*  But one of them is that you have on the one hand, an incumbent who's sort of running against
*  an incumbent, except he's not actually, and he has the privileges of the challenger, right?
*  Trump does.
*  And for them to reset that is absolutely critical.
*  And my sort of fancy, pretentious way of thinking about it is that if this is a John Locke election,
*  Biden wins easily, right?
*  But if it's a Hobbes election, everything is more complicated.
*  All right, you're going to have to explain your fancy way of thinking about this.
*  Well, basically, this is what it is like being edited by Aaron Radica.
*  You'll be turning it a piece.
*  You'll be like, there'll be like a little comment like, this is John Locke election
*  or is this a Hobbes election?
*  Yeah, well, I'm going to get started by talking about 1892 in a minute, too, which is the
*  last time this, well, I'll just say it now, which is the last time this happened, right?
*  We had Benjamin Harrison and Grover Cleveland, Grover Cleveland lost to Harrison, came back
*  and won in 1892.
*  And why did he win?
*  Well, that's a good question that I don't know the answer to, really.
*  I mean, there's no direct comparison to the situation now.
*  It's just the last time where you had two, they were, what is similar is that you had
*  two very unpopular politicians running against each other.
*  And for the Biden administration, it should be a source of fear in the sense that Harrison
*  was unable to push back against Cleveland's idea that things had been better under him.
*  Anyway, the point of all this is that it can and does happen that the person who was out
*  gets back in on the argument, both that their administration was superior and that they're
*  going to change what was done.
*  But let's stick with Hobbes and Locke.
*  The basic idea being that, right, if the question is one of order and constitutions and who
*  is going to provide greater freedom and who's a greater threat to the constitutional system,
*  if those kind of questions, which as you say, Biden is interested in, but it's quite possible
*  that most of America isn't, then he wins easily on that, right?
*  Because Donald Trump is a clear threat to the constitutional order.
*  It's not a question.
*  It's not a theory.
*  They actually marched on the Capitol, right?
*  But if it's a Hobbes election, a war of all against all, state of nature, right, and you
*  were just driving at this is what made me think about it.
*  It's an election where the question is, who's strong?
*  Who's weak?
*  Who's going to save me?
*  Who's going to potentially hurt me?
*  And Biden has to be able to win on those terms also, because we don't know what events are
*  going to be like.
*  If 2024 somehow turns out to be like 1968, right, then so much that is going to come,
*  we haven't seen it.
*  In that case, you have Martin Luther King Jr. being assassinated.
*  You have Bobby Kennedy being assassinated.
*  Someone ends up being the Democratic nominee who didn't run in a single primary.
*  I mean, there's just so many things that no one could possibly have known were going to
*  happen in March of 1968.
*  Johnson hadn't even said he wasn't going to run yet.
*  That's what I mean.
*  So if the world continues to feel like it's a state of nature to people, then Biden has
*  to be able to win that election.
*  And I guess what I'm asking is, do you feel that the Comeback Kid framework will work
*  if that's the field that is prepared for the election?
*  I think I actually really like this.
*  This binary you've set.
*  And I think the thing is, you really don't want this to be the binary.
*  No, definitely not.
*  This is my biggest worry about a lot of the kind of liberals I've spoken to about the
*  election.
*  They want this to be a referendum on the Constitution, on like the existence of American democracy.
*  To the extent the American people refuse to cooperate in seeing the election that way,
*  their argument is the media needs to yell at them more about it and tell them they are
*  more wrong about what Donald Trump was like and the threat that he poses.
*  And it's not that you can shelve any of that.
*  I mean, again, like the number of stories that we have all done.
*  I mean, we just did an episode on the show a couple weeks ago about whether or not Donald
*  Trump should be barred from running constitutionally because he's an insurrectionist.
*  But I do think there are things people know about Donald Trump.
*  And at some point, you have to ask, like, the voters you need to win.
*  Is this the way they are going to see it?
*  Like are they open to hearing this from you?
*  I'm not sure all of them are.
*  I think you have to make arguments that hit people where they are not where you are.
*  And the reason I like the Comeback America argument is it's neither a Hobbesian nor a
*  Lockean argument.
*  Could I say maybe it's a Rawlsian argument?
*  You can do it too.
*  It's a little bit more about, you know, go behind the veil of ignorance.
*  Imagine there's another crisis, right?
*  Imagine another COVID.
*  Imagine another recession.
*  Like think about how this actually went last time.
*  Who do you want?
*  And which kind of group of people do you want managing it?
*  Well, like, let's look at how America is actually doing now.
*  And like, let's look at how it was doing at the end of the last guy's presidency.
*  It doesn't require you to force people out of something that they're used to thinking about.
*  So look, I mean, I think you should have both arguments there.
*  And I think part of the power of that State of the Union was that he did, right?
*  He began with the argument that is most compelling to him, the freedom argument.
*  But he made it at some length, the argument that has not really been that present, which
*  is an argument about his own record, his own incumbency, and the kind of America that he
*  is trying to build, right?
*  The kinds of jobs that he is trying to create, the picket lines he has walked, the new technologies
*  he's attempting to invest in, right?
*  We are in a comeback.
*  The thing it is like is Obama in 2012, right?
*  Obama in 2012 had, at this point, he was polling way above where Biden is now polling.
*  He was beating Mitt Romney in polls.
*  He was polling in the high 40s, not the high 30s in favorability.
*  So he was already at a much stronger position.
*  But it's easy to forget that the economy was much, much, much worse then, right?
*  We were still in this slow, grinding recovery from the financial crisis.
*  And Obama was running, not against George W. Bush, who was blamed for the financial
*  crisis and correctly so, he was running against Mitt Romney, who had a very good claim to
*  being a strong economic manager.
*  He'd been a good governor of Massachusetts.
*  He'd been at Bain Capital.
*  He was a businessman.
*  He had made a lot of money.
*  And what the Obama team was able very effectively to do is make an argument about comeback.
*  We weren't where we wanted to be, but my God, look where we were just four years ago.
*  Look how far we've come.
*  And if you can just get people to the point that, yeah, things aren't perfect, but things
*  are going well enough that it's better not to do something crazy right now.
*  And he was like, you know what?
*  I don't love Joe Biden.
*  I don't love the guy.
*  But I don't know.
*  The economy actually is pretty good.
*  My paycheck is pretty good.
*  Trump seems kind of crazy.
*  Better just to not rock the boat.
*  You want that voter, because that voter exists, and that's the kind of voter who might swing
*  either way.
*  You want that voter to come to you.
*  And that voter is, I think, not just sitting around thinking about liberal democracy.
*  I had a conversation with Jared Polis, who is the governor of Colorado, and he won in
*  2022 by something like 18 points.
*  I'd have to go back and look at the exact number, but it's in that range.
*  That's a huge victory, right?
*  Colorado is a bluish state now, but it's still a swingy state.
*  2022 could have been a very hard year.
*  I remember saying, I think actually on the show with you right after the midterm, that
*  I thought Polis' victory was as or more impressive than Ron DeSantis' victory, even though he's
*  getting no coverage at that point.
*  I talked to Polis recently about, well, what was it?
*  He said that we have focused in Colorado very heavily on a cost of living agenda and message.
*  I'm paraphrasing him here, but he said there are a lot of voters who just don't spend their
*  time thinking about liberal democracy.
*  We want every voter who does spend their time thinking about liberal democracy, and I spend
*  a lot of time thinking about liberal democracy, but we need the voters who don't.
*  And so we have here is a cost of living message.
*  And you could see that in what Biden was doing, right?
*  One of the things when he got into talking about second term policies that he began actually
*  talking quite a lot about were a bunch of policies that he had either already passed,
*  that he had passed and now wanted to expand, and that he had not yet passed and wanted
*  to pass.
*  They were all cost of living oriented, right?
*  Getting rid of title insurance on federally backed mortgages.
*  There was the work he has done to cap the price of insulin for a lot of people.
*  The work he has done to get Medicare to begin to being able to negotiate down drug prices
*  and only for certain drugs, but that could be expanded, right?
*  There were a bunch of things there that were reminiscent to me a little bit of second term
*  Clinton where he's like, we're doing good and we got a bunch of ways.
*  We're just going to try to make your life also just a bit better.
*  He had a whole kind of funny little riff on shrink flation and how there's like not as
*  much Snickers in the Snicker bar anymore, right?
*  That cost of living stuff matters to people because again, there are a bunch of voters
*  who are not going to be motivated by liberal democracy.
*  They're going to be motivated by which of these guys can just kind of help me make it
*  through the day a little bit more easily.
*  And Biden really needs to win that argument or at least win it with enough people to win
*  the election.
*  What is the foreign policy agenda for Biden starting in January 2025 the way you see it?
*  Let's start with Israel, Palestine, but I also want to talk about Russia and Ukraine.
*  So I mean, I think it's worth beginning with the thing that he is announcing doing right
*  now, right?
*  Israel is going to build a functional military port to be able to autonomously bring aid
*  into Gaza.
*  That is not going to satisfy people who are furious about American support of the Israeli
*  attack on Gaza, right?
*  I do think it's very important to keep these things a little bit separate.
*  Many people, including at this point myself, do not believe we should be backing what Netanyahu
*  is doing and bringing in aid with one hand while protecting Israel in its, at least at
*  the UN, while it continues to promote a war that at this point seems truly detached from
*  like an actual goal that is achievable.
*  Nevertheless, it is very, very important and a very unusual step for America to take to
*  build its own way to bring in aid to help the people in a territory that our ally is
*  bombing using our bombs, right?
*  The whole situation is genuinely weird, actually, when you think about it.
*  But it's a very strong message from Biden, at least given where he's been, that we find
*  the condition of the Palestinian people right now unacceptable.
*  And Israel definitely better not be bombing our created port.
*  And it's notable that the part of reason they're doing this is things like aid have been held
*  up by the Israelis, right?
*  Which is illegal under American law.
*  There are a lot of people who believe, and I think correctly so, that we are not correctly
*  enforcing our own laws here.
*  It is not legal under the rules we have on how we export arms for some of the kinds of
*  human rights abuses we're seeing to be happening with our armaments.
*  We're not really enforcing those rules.
*  But this is something.
*  The other thing Joe Biden really made a point of saying at the State of the Union is that
*  there is a grand bargain, a grand outcome he is trying to get to in the region, where
*  he is trying to trade Israel recognition with Saudi Arabia and support in containing Iran
*  for Israel's recognition and acceptance of a Palestinian state.
*  So far, the problem is not whether that is Joe Biden's position.
*  It's whether it is Benjamin Netanyahu's position.
*  Now, if Joe Biden has a second term, I think the assumption is Benjamin Netanyahu will
*  not be part of it.
*  Benny Gantz is expected to win the election whenever it happens.
*  We don't know that that will be the outcome, but it seems quite plausible.
*  He was just treated here like he was the head of state.
*  Gantz is starting to be treated in other places like head of state.
*  He just had a meeting in the UK as well.
*  The West is beginning to treat Gantz like the real leader of Israel, Netanyahu like
*  a lame duck, like a problem to be managed.
*  So one argument is that what will happen eventually is that this war will end.
*  There will be an election.
*  Netanyahu will lose and Biden and other Western leaders are going to work with Benny Gantz
*  to try to execute this huge rearrangement.
*  We don't know, right?
*  I mean, that's the right way to put that, right?
*  You don't lose money betting against peace in Israel and among Palestinians, but we don't
*  know.
*  I think the thing that Biden is going to be trying to do right now is show that he really
*  does value Palestinian life.
*  I mean, at the core of the fury and the critique of him is not that he supports Israel.
*  It is that he is supporting Israel in a way that makes it seem like we do not truly value
*  Palestinian life.
*  Building the port while they go too far, I don't think that's going to feel like it is
*  enough to people.
*  Well, it also can be read quite easily as a sign of American weakness because we can't
*  get Israel to do it.
*  Yes, we can't get them to stop doing it.
*  Right?
*  It's a very, again, I want to say this.
*  I both respect what they're doing.
*  It's a very strange thing, right?
*  It is a strange thing to see happening.
*  If we think they're going too far, maybe we don't give them our weaponry, but you heard
*  this too from Biden.
*  Biden was very clear.
*  He began that by saying functionally Israel is right to be attempting to eradicate Hamas.
*  And my understanding and something Richard Haass, the president emeritus of the Council
*  on Foreign Relations was saying on the show a few weeks ago, that the reason that this
*  government is still as strong behind Israel as it is and has not moved into a significantly
*  more critical position where it is more willing to draw red lines is Biden himself.
*  So I mean, this is Biden's view and he's trying to balance these two views against each other.
*  And it's a very complicated thing.
*  I don't think by the 2024 election, the pivot, the grand strategy he's laying out will have
*  had time to come to fruition.
*  I do think in a second term, it is likely we will at least see negotiations in that
*  direction, right?
*  They're going to try to reset this entire thing under new leadership.
*  That is his promise, right?
*  That is a policy he's laying out.
*  In another ongoing area of conflict, the war between Russia and Ukraine, Biden made a big
*  deal of talking about how Putin was, as he's portraying him, on the march.
*  And obviously, at the same time, the administration is having tremendous difficulty getting Ukraine
*  aid through Congress.
*  So what is the second term agenda there?
*  In some foreign affairs thing I was reading, they were saying like, okay, now it's time
*  to start talking about talking.
*  Obviously, that's how talking has to start.
*  But is there another approach you can imagine the Biden administration taking in the second
*  term?
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  I'm not deep enough on this issue to know.
*  What I will say is I think it's worth understanding that what he was doing in the State of the
*  Union was trying to pressure House Republicans to let the aid package through and also trying
*  to make this as part of their kind of anti-freedom agenda, right?
*  To the extent that one of the overarching arguments here that Biden is making is there
*  is actually a worldwide fight between freedom and tyranny.
*  He was connecting Putin and Trump, and he was connecting support for Ukraine and support
*  for American democracy.
*  I think there's a belief that at this point, right, and I've seen a number of articles
*  saying that it is privately believed and they're trying to figure out inside the administration
*  that Zelensky needs to move into a more defensive position in terms of the war strategy and
*  basically grind Russia to a halt.
*  You can make this continuously costly on Russia, and at some point you're going to sue for
*  peace here, right?
*  And nobody's going to like it.
*  But the belief they can win is something that is currently being said but is not truly internally
*  believed.
*  But the thing that can happen is they could lose, and they could lose if we stop giving
*  them military aid.
*  And the reason we'd stop giving them military aid is that Republicans have decided they
*  wanted Russia to win, and they wanted that because Donald Trump wanted that.
*  I thought it was very striking when Biden just said that it is unacceptable, right,
*  to say that Vladimir Putin can do whatever he wants to NATO members that we feel aren't
*  doing their fair share, that Trump has moved into a position on foreign policy.
*  It's actually unacceptable that whatever you believe about Zelensky's strategy and whether
*  or not they can actually win, making an American policy that Russia should win is unacceptable.
*  That is un-American.
*  And Biden's right on that.
*  And I think that's, among other things, a strong contrast.
*  I actually do think Donald Trump, when you get out of sort of high-flying, you know,
*  we shouldn't be giving our money to other people, we should be building things here
*  at home, when you actually get down to brass tacks on what he is saying, we should let
*  Vladimir Putin overrun Ukraine.
*  I don't think people agree with that.
*  That was Biden using the State of the Union speech in a more traditional way to move aspects
*  of his agenda, in that case, Ukraine, aid, and he also tried to do that on immigration,
*  which we haven't talked about, but we should.
*  Biden brought up the border deal they had negotiated, which for a moment it seemed like
*  it was actually about to happen, and he called out Trump for scuttling it in the most overt
*  and direct way because it would hurt Trump's campaign.
*  So again, looking ahead to 2025, let's say Biden wins, let's say he does not have both
*  chambers of Congress, he has one or he has none.
*  Is there a space for a deal like that to finally happen?
*  I think it's very hard to know the condition of the Republican Party and the sort of leadership
*  trends in the Republican Party in the event of a Donald Trump loss, right?
*  What you might have expected would happen if Donald Trump lost in 2020 did not happen,
*  but there was a period after 2020 when Republicans were more willing to work with Joe Biden.
*  I mean, Joe Biden really did get bipartisan votes on the infrastructure bill.
*  He really did get bipartisan votes on the Chips and Science Act.
*  So there very much, I think, could be a period where some kinds of deal making are possible.
*  And it was interesting watching the camera pivot to Senator James Lankford, who's very
*  conservative and was the Republican negotiator on the bipartisan border bill.
*  And he was like nodding along with Joe Biden, right?
*  I mean, he has suddenly been demonized for negotiating a very conservative bill, a bill
*  that dragged the Democratic Party substantially to the right on immigration and got a lot
*  of things Republicans have often wanted.
*  And then, you know, for the very crime of trying to solve a problem Republicans said
*  they wanted to solve, he became the sort of enemy of the day over there.
*  And so there are people like that.
*  And you know, what you would have to trade or not trade, what Joe Biden can do through
*  executive orders is also a kind of interesting question.
*  I would say having done some reporting with the Biden administration on this, I think
*  it, one, it's very, I think very important to realize that they believe this is a real
*  problem, right?
*  They are not sitting there saying, as has been true at other times.
*  Fox News is making up a border crisis, right?
*  You remember the caravan, right?
*  Like that was kind of a made up crisis.
*  In 2018.
*  In 2018.
*  What is happening at the border now is not a made up crisis.
*  We are actually dealing with record levels of apprehensions at the asylum system, as
*  Biden very, very well described, is completely broken.
*  People are coming in, they get put into America for years as a way to hearing because the
*  system is so overwhelmed and overloaded.
*  That's a perfectly reasonable bet to make even if you don't think you're going to prevail
*  at your hearing.
*  They want to fix it.
*  And I guess in theory, eventually Republicans want to fix it as well, but they're not going
*  to fix it in a year when Donald Trump is running for president and when he's telling them not
*  to.
*  The other thing you saw, though, is what a gift Trump gave Biden, right?
*  What a gift Trump gave him.
*  Because now you can imagine the world where the bipartisan border bill passed.
*  These things take some time to implement.
*  It takes time to hire and train however many thousand new asylum officers.
*  Takes time to bring in those verification and drug machines that Biden was talking about.
*  As Biden is talking about how we pass the toughest border bill in American history,
*  whatever.
*  But actually, it doesn't look like anything is all that different at the border by election
*  day.
*  But by killing the compromise, what Trump gave them was a way to say, we were the ones
*  who wanted to pass the toughest border bill, and you kept us from solving the problem.
*  You kept this from happening.
*  So rather than having to own the actual outcome, Biden right now doesn't have to own the outcome.
*  Trump in a way is owning the outcome, or at least can in an argumentative way.
*  And Biden can own the desire to solve the problem.
*  I think that's a good place to end actually, because we've more or less run out of time
*  anyway.
*  Obviously, we didn't get to everything, but we got to a lot.
*  And there's another eight months, God help us, of this campaign.
*  So plenty more time for this kind of conversation.
*  But I'm going to spring something on you, because as people maybe have caught on to,
*  you're a man who reads a lot of history.
*  You're a man who's deep in the stacks.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience to understand or contextualize this
*  moment in American political history?
*  Oh, wow.
*  Okay.
*  Was I warned about this?
*  You were not.
*  I was not.
*  Okay, I'm going to push one book that I've been pushing on everybody, which is, I would
*  not call it a book that will tell you everything you need to know about what's happening now.
*  But it's a really interesting and instructive book about sort of what we've lost.
*  It doesn't mean to be that, but it is because we've lost it.
*  And that is this biography by John Farrell of Tip O'Neill that I just read that has many
*  incredible things in it.
*  But it represents a world where Tip O'Neill, when he's speaker of the House, Ronald Reagan
*  is president, and they are, in fact, able to function.
*  They are slashing each other all day.
*  And then they say, you know, we're going to be friends at night.
*  Is it perfect?
*  No, it's not perfect.
*  And many terrible things were done.
*  But even so, the political process is functioning in a way that right now it's not.
*  And it was very interesting to read that.
*  I guess another way I would also answer that question is that the 19th century always tells
*  us a tremendous amount about the 21st.
*  Something I've been reading that I haven't actually finished that is speaking to the
*  moment, very much for me, is Stephen Hahn's history of the 19th century.
*  It's in Eric Foner's Penguin History of America series.
*  It's called A Nation Without Borders.
*  But the reason it's so resonant now is that the 19th century still informs so much of
*  what happens in the 21st in that you're seeing America attempt to become an empire, even
*  though that, of course, is not what was supposed to happen, right?
*  You're seeing America in terms of its internal colonialism with regard to Native Americans,
*  right?
*  Seminole War, which Hahn points out, is like the longest American war until Vietnam.
*  And it's just a whole set of thoughts and ideas that I think are helpful for this moment.
*  All right.
*  Well, that's two.
*  So for a third, I'm going to stick with the theme of the 19th century controlling the
*  21st and recommend Joanne Freeman's book, Field of Blood, which is also incredibly resonant
*  today.
*  Joanne frees up books at political violence inside Congress, inside the building itself.
*  In the 1830s and 40s and 50s, actual brawls between congressmen, thrashings, there's lots
*  of weapons.
*  And she uses that as a way of understanding the political violence that was taking America
*  over at the time and that culminated, obviously, in the Civil War.
*  That kind of intersection between personal and political violence has been the subject
*  of all of her work.
*  And in this book, it's really quite extraordinary.
*  Yeah.
*  Field of Blood is amazing.
*  And I think it's one of those books that after you read it, you will never again listen to
*  somebody say to you, oh my God, American political division has never been this bad.
*  Yeah.
