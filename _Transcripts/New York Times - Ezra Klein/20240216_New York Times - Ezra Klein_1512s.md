# Democrats Have a Better Option Than Biden
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnsCxDOIqcA)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  My heart breaks a bit for Joe Biden.
*  This is a man who has been running for president since he was young.
*  He wins the presidency finally, unexpectedly, when he's old.
*  And that age brought him wisdom.
*  It brought an openness that hadn't always been there in him.
*  He's governed as a throwback to a time before I alone can fix it.
*  A time when presidents were party leaders, coalition builders.
*  Biden has held together a democratic party that could easily have splintered.
*  Think back to the 2020 campaign when he beats Bernie Sanders, when he beats Elizabeth Warren,
*  when his victory was seen as, was in reality, the moderate wing triumphing over the progressive
*  wing, the establishment over the insurgents.
*  But instead of making them bend the knee, instead of acting as a victor, Biden acted
*  as a leader.
*  He partnered with Bernie Sanders.
*  He built the unity task forces.
*  He integrated Warren's and Sanders' ideas and staff into not just his campaign, but
*  his administration.
*  I had a conversation recently with Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the House Progressive
*  Caucus, and I asked her why the Democratic Party hasn't ruptured the way Republicans
*  have.
*  And she pointed me back to that moment.
*  Biden, she said, made this, quote, huge attempt to pull the Democratic Party back together
*  before the 2020 election in a way I've really never seen before, end quote.
*  And it worked.
*  Democrats had 50 votes in the Senate.
*  50 votes that stretched from Bernie Sanders on the left all the way to Joe Manchin on
*  the right.
*  Biden and Chuck Schumer, they often cannot lose even one of those votes, and at crucial
*  moments they didn't.
*  With that almost impossible to hold together coalition, the Biden administration and Congressional
*  Democrats passed a series of bills, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, the Inflation Reduction
*  Act, the Chips and Science Act, that will make this a decade of infrastructure and invention,
*  a decade of building, of decarbonizing, of researching.
*  They expanded the Affordable Care Act, and it worked.
*  More than 21 million people signed up for the ACA last year, a record.
*  They did what Democrats have promised to do forever and took at least the first steps
*  towards letting Medicare negotiate drug prices.
*  And the Biden team, they said they were going to run the economy hot, that at long last
*  they were going to prioritize full employment, and they did.
*  And then inflation shot up, not just here, but in Europe, in Canada, pretty much everywhere.
*  The pandemic had twisted global supply chains, and then the economies had reopened, and people
*  desperate to live again took their pandemic savings and they spent.
*  And the Biden team, in partnership with Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve, they brought
*  inflation back down, and we are still beneath 4% unemployment still.
*  And I don't want to skip over that accomplishment.
*  Most economists said that would not happen.
*  The overwhelming consensus was we were headed for recession, that the so-called soft landing
*  was a fantasy.
*  It got mocked as, quote, immaculate disinflation.
*  But that is exactly what happened.
*  We didn't have a recession.
*  We are still seeing strong wage gains for the poorest Americans.
*  Inequality is down.
*  Growth is quick.
*  America is far stronger economically right now than Europe, than Canada, than China.
*  You want to be us.
*  And yet Biden's poll numbers are dismal.
*  His approval rating lingers in the high 30s.
*  Most polls show him losing to Donald Trump in 2024.
*  Then comes the special counsel report, which finds no criminal wrongdoing in his treatment
*  of classified information, which is, remember, the question the special counsel was appointed
*  to investigate.
*  But the counsel takes a drive by on Biden's cognitive fitness, since the jury would think
*  him, quote, a well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory, since Biden doesn't remember
*  when his son, Bo, died.
*  And Biden, enraged, does what people have been asking him to do this whole time.
*  He takes the age issue head on and he gives this press conference full of fury.
*  There's even reference that I don't remember when my son died.
*  How in the hell dare he raise that?
*  Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn't any other damn
*  business.
*  I'm well-meaning and I'm an elderly man and I know what the hell I'm doing.
*  I've been president and I put this country back on its feet.
*  I don't need his recommendation.
*  It's totally our...
*  How bad is your memory and can you continue as president?
*  My memory is so bad, I let you speak.
*  And then when he's about to leave, he comes back to take one more question.
*  This one on Israel and Gaza, where he says that America is no longer lockstep behind
*  Netanyahu's invasion.
*  And then describing the effort he put in getting President Sisi to open the Egyptian border
*  for aid, he slips.
*  He calls Sisi the president of Mexico.
*  Makes a kind of slip anyone can make, but a kind of slip he is making too often now.
*  A kind of slip that means more when he makes it than when someone else does.
*  Since the beginning of Biden's administration, I've been asking people who work with him,
*  how does he seem?
*  How red in is he?
*  What's he like in the meetings?
*  Maybe not a great sign that I felt the need to do that, that a lot of reporters have been
*  doing that, but still.
*  And I am convinced watching him, listening to the testimony of those who meet with him,
*  not all people who like him.
*  I'm convinced he's able to do the job of the presidency, that he has sharpened meetings,
*  that he has sound in his judgments.
*  I cannot point you, even now, to a moment where Biden faltered in the presidency because
*  his age had slowed him.
*  But here's the thing.
*  I can point you to moments where he is faltering in his campaign for the presidency because
*  his age is slowing him.
*  This distinction between the job of the presidency and the job of running for the presidency
*  keeps getting muddied, including by Biden himself.
*  Listen to this moment from a little bit earlier in that same press conference.
*  Why does it have to be you now?
*  What is your answer to that question?
*  Because I'm the most qualified person in this country to be president of the United States
*  and finish the job I started.
*  This is a question Democrats keep wanting to answer.
*  The question the Biden administration keeps pretending only to hear.
*  Can Biden do the job of president?
*  But that's not the question of the 2024 campaign.
*  The insistence that Biden is capable of being president is being used to shut down discussion
*  whether he is capable of running for president.
*  I've had my own journey on this.
*  I've written a number of columns about how Biden keeps proving pundits wrong, about how
*  he's proven me wrong.
*  He won in 2020 despite plenty of naysayers.
*  The Democrats won in 2022 to find predictions.
*  I had in 2022 been planning to write a column after the midterms saying there should be
*  a primary.
*  Democrats needed to have a primary because Democrats needed to see how strong of a campaigner
*  Biden still was.
*  The test needed to be run.
*  But when they overperformed, that drained all interest among the major possible candidates
*  in running.
*  The test wasn't going to happen.
*  But still, I thought Biden might surprise again.
*  I'd grown wary of underestimating him.
*  We had to wait till this year, till now really, to see Biden even begin to show what he'd
*  be like on the campaign trail.
*  And what I think we're seeing is that he is not up for this.
*  He is not the campaigner he was even five years ago.
*  That's not insider reporting on my part.
*  Go watch a speech he gave in Pennsylvania, kicking off his campaign in 2019.
*  I'm Joe Biden and I'm Jill Hudson.
*  You all think I'm kidding.
*  That's how I'm identifying.
*  Everyone knows that Jill is a Philadelphia girl.
*  She loves this city.
*  I do too.
*  But to paraphrase the poet James Joyce, I have to say this folks because I'm near my
*  state.
*  When I die, Delaware will written on my heart.
*  The way he moves, the energy in his voice.
*  Then go watch the speech he gave last month in Valley Forge, kicking off his reelection
*  campaign.
*  Thank you.
*  Please.
*  Thank you.
*  Please.
*  Thank you very, very much.
*  Today, the topic of my speech today is deadly serious.
*  And I think it needs to be made at the outset of this campaign.
*  No comparison here.
*  Both speeches are on YouTube and you can see it.
*  The Democrats denying decline are only fooling themselves.
*  But even given that, I was stunned when his team passed on the Super Bowl interview.
*  Biden's not up by 12 points.
*  He can't coast to victory.
*  He's losing.
*  He is behind in most polls.
*  He is behind despite everything people already know about Donald Trump.
*  He needs to make up ground.
*  If he does not make up ground, Trump wins.
*  The Super Bowl is one of the biggest audiences you will ever have.
*  And you just skip it.
*  You just say no.
*  The Biden team's argument, to be fair, is this.
*  Who wants to see the president during the Super Bowl anyway?
*  And even if they did the interview, CBS would just choose three or four minutes of a 15
*  minute interview to air.
*  What if CBS chooses a clip that makes Biden look bad?
*  It's all true.
*  But that's all true in the context of a team that does not believe that the more people
*  see Biden, the more they will like him.
*  There's a reason that other presidents do the Super Bowl interview.
*  There's a reason Biden himself did it in 2021 and in 2022.
*  There is a reason Trump said he would gladly take Biden's place this year.
*  I was talking to James Carville, who's one of the chief strategists behind Bill Clinton's
*  1992 campaign.
*  And he put this really well to me.
*  He said that a campaign has certain assets, but the most desirable asset is the candidate.
*  And the Biden campaign does not treat Biden like he's a desirable asset.
*  Biden does fewer interviews than any recent president, and it's not close.
*  By this point in the presidency, Obama had given more than 400 interviews.
*  Trump had given 300.
*  Biden?
*  Biden's given fewer than 100.
*  And a bunch of them are softball interviews.
*  They'll go on Conan O'Brien's podcast or Jay Shetty's mindfulness podcast.
*  The Biden team says this is a strategy, that they need a political voter, so ones who are
*  not listening to political media.
*  But one, the strategy isn't working.
*  Biden is down, not up.
*  And two, no one really buys this argument.
*  I don't buy this argument.
*  This is not a strategy chosen from a full universe of options.
*  This is a strategic adaptation, a strategic adaptation to Biden's perceived, maybe real,
*  And what's worse is it may be a wise one.
*  I want to say this clearly.
*  I like Biden.
*  I think he's been a good president.
*  I think he is a good president.
*  I don't like having this conversation.
*  And I know a lot of liberals, a lot of Democrats are going to be furious at me for this show.
*  But to say this is a media invention, that people are worried about Biden's age because
*  the media keeps telling them to be worried about Biden's age.
*  If you've really convinced yourself of that in your heart of hearts, I almost don't know
*  what to tell you.
*  In poll after poll, 70 to 80 percent of voters are worried about his age.
*  This is not a thing people need the media to see.
*  It is right in front of them.
*  And it is also shaping how Biden and his campaign are acting.
*  Democrats keep telling themselves when they look at the polls that voters will come back
*  to Biden when the campaign starts in earnest and they begin seeing more and more and more
*  of Donald Trump, when they have to take what he is and what it would mean for him to return
*  seriously.
*  But that is going to go both ways.
*  When the campaign begins in earnest, they will also see much more of Joe Biden.
*  People who barely pay attention to him now, they will be watching his speeches.
*  You will see him on the news constantly.
*  Will they actually like what they see?
*  Will it comfort them?
*  That was why that press conference mattered.
*  That press conference had a point.
*  It had a purpose.
*  The purpose was to reassure voters of Biden's cognitive fitness, particularly his memory.
*  And Biden couldn't do that, not for one night, not for fewer than 15 minutes.
*  And these kinds of gaffes have become commonplace for him.
*  He recently said he'd been speaking to former French President Francois Mitterrand when
*  he meant Emmanuel Macron.
*  He said he'd been talking to former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl when he meant Angela
*  Merkel.
*  None of these matter much on their own.
*  The human mind just does this.
*  But it does it more as you get older.
*  And they do matter collectively.
*  Voters believe Biden is too old for the job he seeks.
*  He needs to persuade them otherwise.
*  And he is failing at that task.
*  Arguably the central task of his reelection campaign.
*  And that can become a self-fulfilling cycle.
*  His staff knows that press conference was a disaster.
*  So how will they respond to it?
*  What will they do now?
*  They will hold him back from aggressive campaigning even more, from unscripted situations.
*  They'll try to make doubly sure that doesn't happen again.
*  But they need a candidate.
*  Democrats need a candidate who can aggressively campaign because, again, and I cannot emphasize
*  this enough, they are currently losing.
*  Part of my job is talking to the kinds of Democrats who run and win campaigns constantly.
*  And all of them are worried about this.
*  None of them say this is an invention or not a real issue.
*  And this is key.
*  It's not the age itself they're worried about.
*  The age of 81 doesn't mean anything.
*  It is the impression Biden is giving of age, of slowness, of frailty.
*  The presidency is a performance.
*  You are not just making decisions.
*  You are acting out the things people want to believe about the president.
*  The president is in command, strong, energetic, compassionate, thoughtful, that they don't
*  need to worry about all that is happening in the world because a president has it all
*  under control.
*  Whether it is true that Biden has it all under control, it is not true that he seems like
*  he does.
*  Some political strategists I know think that's why his poll numbers remain so low.
*  But even when good things happen, people don't really think he did them.
*  One was telling me that what worries him most about Biden is how stable his approval rating
*  is.
*  It doesn't really go up or down.
*  Inflation has gone down a lot in recent months.
*  People feel better about the economy.
*  You can see that in consumer sentiment data.
*  But Biden's approval rating, it has not gone up.
*  His performance on Ukraine did not make it go up.
*  The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act did not make it go up.
*  For this strategist, it looked a lot like Americans just don't give Biden credit for
*  things even when he deserves them.
*  And Biden is not now a capable or aggressive enough campaigner to win that credit for himself.
*  The arguments I see even some smart Democrats making so they don't have to look at this
*  directly are self-defeating.
*  The one I hear most often is that Donald Trump is also old.
*  He's 77.
*  He also mixes up names.
*  He recently called Nancy Pelosi Nikki Haley.
*  He sometimes speaks in gibberish.
*  And it is all true.
*  But that is a reason to nominate a candidate who can exploit the fact that Donald Trump
*  is old and confused.
*  The point is not to give Donald Trump an even match here.
*  The point is to beat Donald Trump.
*  Another argument I see is that this is ageism.
*  This is an unfair thing to point out about Joe Biden.
*  It is age discrimination.
*  And I've actually seen people make this argument.
*  Age discrimination is illegal in the workplace.
*  And it's not illegal in the electorate.
*  If the voters are ageist and Biden loses because of it, there's no recourse.
*  You can't sue the voters for age discrimination.
*  And then there's the argument you've heard on the show, an argument I have made and considered
*  myself.
*  Biden doesn't look like a strong candidate.
*  But Democrats keep on winning.
*  Biden won in 2020.
*  Democrats won in 2022.
*  They've been winning elections in 2023.
*  They just won George Santos's seat in New York.
*  There is an anti-MAGA majority in this country, and it will come out to stop Donald Trump.
*  And I think that might be true.
*  I still think Biden might win against Trump, even with all I've said.
*  It's just that there's a very good chance he might lose, maybe better than even odds.
*  And Trump is dangerous.
*  I want better odds than that.
*  I think one reason Democrats react so defensively to critiques of Biden is that they've come
*  to a kind of fatalism.
*  They believe it is too late to do anything else.
*  And if it is too late to do anything else, then to even talk about Biden's age is to
*  contribute to Donald Trump's victory.
*  But that's absurd.
*  It is February.
*  Fatalism this far before the election is ridiculous.
*  Yeah, it's too late to throw this to primaries, but it's not too late to do something.
*  So then what?
*  Step one, unfortunately, is convincing Biden that he should not run again, that he does
*  not want to risk being Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a heroic, brilliant public servant who causes
*  the outcome she feared most because she didn't retire early enough.
*  That in stepping aside, he would be able to finish out his term as a strong and focused
*  president and people would see the honor in what he did in putting his country over his
*  ambitions.
*  The people who Biden listens to, Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, Mike Donilon, Ron Klain, Nancy
*  Pelosi, Anita Dunn, they need to get him to see this.
*  Biden may come to see it himself.
*  I take nothing away from how hard that is, how much Biden wants to finish the job he
*  has started, keep doing the good he believes he can do.
*  Retirement can be often is a trauma, but losing to Donald Trump would be far worse.
*  But let's say Biden ultimately agrees and steps aside.
*  Then what?
*  Well, the Democrats do something that used to be common in politics, but hasn't been
*  in decades.
*  They pick the nominee at the convention.
*  This is how parties chose nominees for most of American history.
*  From roughly 1831 to 1968, this is how it worked.
*  In a way, this is still how it works.
*  I'm going to be doing a whole episode on how an open convention works.
*  So this is going to be a quick version.
*  The parties still pick the nominees at conventions, even right now.
*  When someone wins a primary or a caucus, what they actually win is delegates slots.
*  Then those delegates get selected.
*  How that works is different in different states.
*  Then they go to the convention to choose the actual nominee.
*  The whole convention structure is still there.
*  We still use it.
*  We still have the delegates voting at the convention.
*  What is different now than in the past is that most delegates arrive at the convention
*  committed to a candidate.
*  But without getting too into the weeds of state delegate rules here, if their candidate
*  drops out, if Biden drops out, they can be released to vote for who they want.
*  The last open convention Democrats had was 1968, a disaster of a convention where the
*  parties split between pro and anti-Vietnam war factions, where there was violence in
*  the streets, where Democrats lost the election.
*  That's not how most conventions have gone.
*  It was a convention that picked Abraham Lincoln over William Seward.
*  It was a convention that chose FDR over Al Smith.
*  I've been reading Ed Acorn's book, The Lincoln Miracle, inside the Republican Convention
*  that Changed History.
*  My favorite line in it comes from Senator Charles Sumner, who sends a welcome note to
*  the delegates where he says, quote, whose duty it will be to organize victory, whose
*  duty it will be to organize victory.
*  I love that.
*  That's what a convention is supposed to do.
*  It's what a political party is supposed to do.
*  Organize victory, because victory doesn't just happen.
*  It has to be organized.
*  Everybody I have talked to about this, literally everybody, has brought up the same fear.
*  Call this a Kamala Harris problem.
*  In theory, she should be the favorite, but she pulls a bit worse than Biden.
*  Democrats don't trust that she would be a stronger candidate, but they worry that if
*  she wasn't chosen, it would rip the party apart.
*  And I think this is wrong on two levels.
*  First, I think Harris is underrated now.
*  Is she a political juggernaut, a generational political talent?
*  Probably not.
*  But she's a capable politician, which is one reason Biden chose her as his running mate
*  in the first place.
*  She's not thrived as vice president.
*  The DC narrative on her has turned extremely negative.
*  But when Kamala Harris ran campaigns as Kamala Harris, this wasn't how she was seen.
*  And Harris, in private settings, she's enormously magnetic and compelling.
*  Her challenge would be translating that into her public persona, which is, let's be blunt
*  about this, a hard thing to do when you've grown up in a world that has always been quick
*  to find your faults.
*  A world that is afraid of women being angry, of black people being angry.
*  A world where for most of your life, it was demanded of you that you be cautious and careful
*  and measured and never make a mistake.
*  And then you get on the public stage and people say, oh, you're too cautious and too careful
*  and too measured.
*  It's a very, very, very hard bind to get out of.
*  But maybe she can do it.
*  Still, it is a party's job to organize victory.
*  If Harris cannot convince delegates that she is the best shot at victory, she should not
*  and probably would not be chosen.
*  And I don't think that would rip the party apart.
*  There is a ton of talent in the Democratic Party right now.
*  Gretchen Whitmer, Wes Moore, Jared Polis, Gavin Newsom, Raphael Warnock, Josh Shapiro,
*  Cory Booker, Ro Khanna, Pete Buttigieg, Gina Raimondo, AOC, Chris Murphy, Andy Beshear,
*  JB Pritzker, and a list like this could go on and on.
*  Some of these people would make a run at the nomination.
*  They would give speeches at the convention and people would actually pay attention.
*  The whole country would be watching the Democratic convention and probably quite a bit happening
*  the run up to it and seeing what this murderer's row of political talent could actually do.
*  And when it was all tested and seen and heard from and debated, some ticket would be chosen.
*  A ticket that was new to the American people would get a ton of coverage.
*  Could that go badly?
*  Sure.
*  That doesn't mean it will go badly.
*  It could make the Democrats into the most exciting political show on earth.
*  And over there on the other side, that's going to be Trump getting nominated and a who's
*  who of MAGA types slavering over his leadership.
*  The best of the Democratic Party against the worst of the Republican Party, a party that
*  actually listened to the voters against a party that denies the outcome of elections,
*  a party that did something different over a party that has again nominated a threat
*  to democracy who has never not once won the popular vote in a general election.
*  That seems like an okay contrast to me.
*  Yes, the Democratic Party has been winning elections recently, but it is winning those
*  elections in part because it has taken candidate recruitment seriously.
*  That was true in 2020.
*  Biden wasn't the candidate that set the base's heart aflutter, but he seemed like the candidate
*  with the best shot at winning.
*  So Democrats did the strategic thing and picked him and they won.
*  In 2022, Democrats carefully chose candidates who fit their districts, who fit their states.
*  Or Republicans chose a bunch of MAGA soaked extremists.
*  And that is why those Democrats won.
*  The lesson here is not the Democrats don't need to think hard about who they run in elections.
*  It is that they do need to think hard about who they run in elections and they have been.
*  They need to be strategic, not sentimental.
*  And they have been because the alternative is Donald Trump.
*  And Donald Trump is dangerous.
*  And right now, Donald Trump is ahead.
*  I have this nightmare that Trump wins in 2024.
*  And then in 2025 and in 2026, outcome the campaign tell all books.
*  And they're full of emails and WhatsApp messages between Biden staffers and Democratic leaders,
*  where they're all saying to each other, this is a disaster.
*  He's not going to win this.
*  I can't bear to watch his speech.
*  We're going to lose.
*  But they didn't say any of it publicly.
*  They didn't do anything because it was too dangerous for their careers or too uncomfortable
*  given their loyalty to Biden.
*  I've said on the show before that we live in a strange era with the parties.
*  We've gone from the cliche being that Democrats fall in love and Republicans fall in line
*  to the reality being that Democrats fall in line and Republicans fall apart.
*  I've mostly meant that as a critique of Republican chaos.
*  But too much order can be its own kind of pathology.
*  A party that is too quick to fall in line, that cannot break line, is a party will be
*  too slow, maybe unable to solve hard problems.
*  So yes, I think Biden, as painful as this is, should find his way to stepping down as
*  a hero.
*  That the party should help him find his way to that, to being the thing that he said he
*  would be in 2020.
*  The bridge to the next generation of Democrats.
*  And then I think Democrats should meet in August at the convention to do what political
*  parties have done at conventions so many times before.
*  Organize victory.
*  So I recognize there's going to be a lot of questions, comments, pushback to this piece.
*  So we're going to do an Ask Me Anything episode next week on this on 2024 Broadly.
*  We've set up a voicemail box if you want to leave a message that could get played on
*  the show, please keep them under a minute.
*  We're not going to use ones that are very long.
*  The number for that is 212-556-7300.
*  Again, 212-556-7300.
*  Or you can email us both text and a voice note at Ezra Klein Show at NYTimes.com.
