# Best Of: A Powerful Theory of Why the Far Right Is Thriving Across the Globe
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [March 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfPnhXG_EQI)
*  Hey, it is Ezra. We're doing a Re-Air today, but it's one of my favorite episodes and one that I
*  think has particular relevance right now. Given the stress that politicians like Donald Trump
*  play on political systems, what is the nature of their appeal? This conversation with Pippa Norris,
*  getting at her theory of it, is I think particularly compelling because it isn't just
*  about Donald Trump, because it puts Donald Trump and politicians like him in a global context where
*  we can look for similarities and see perhaps a little bit more deeply what is going on in
*  the electorates that power them. Take a listen. I'm Ezra Klein. This is The Ezra Klein Show.
*  It's easy to look at American politics as aberrational right now. It's comforting in a way.
*  Maybe the whole problem, the whole question is Donald Trump and the unique magnetism and
*  attributes he brings to modern politics. I mean, Trump has many things, but one thing he is is
*  distinctive. Once a billionaire or maybe billionaire developer, known for being a businessman,
*  a celebrity reality TV star forever in the tabloids with an unerring sense of what will
*  get people's attention, who is somehow immune to the disciplining force of shame.
*  Maybe that's a story right there, the particular package of attributes Donald Trump brings to all
*  this. And then you have the weird dimension of American institutions, a Republican party that
*  he was able to take over in part due to our weird way of doing primaries and the electoral college
*  and the way we distribute power. So it's easy to step back from that and think something's just
*  wrong with America. Why are we taken in by this guy? But maybe nothing's wrong with America,
*  or at least nothing specific. Look at Joe Biden. Joe Biden may be polling in the low 40s and people
*  can come up with all kinds of explanations for that, but that's better than other G7 leaders
*  right now. In Canada, Justin Trudeau, also in the low 40s. In France, Emmanuel Macron, upper 20s.
*  In Germany, Olaf Scholz, also in the 20s. In the UK, Liz Truss was at 9%, 9% when she
*  resigned as prime minister, and she resigned mere months after Boris Johnson had also resigned
*  as prime minister. Nor is the Republican party's ongoing competitiveness or turn towards a more
*  reactionary subversive message, all that unusual. Italy just elected a far-right prime minister from
*  a party with fascist roots. In France, Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader, she won around 40%
*  of the vote in the final round of their presidential elections, doing better than she did in 2017. In
*  Sweden, I mean Sweden, a hard-right group founded by neo-Nazis and skinheads, won the second highest
*  number of seats in parliament in elections earlier this year. In Brazil, Bolsonaro lost on Sunday.
*  I mean, Bolsonaro is about as Trumpy a figure you will find outside of the Trump family,
*  so it's a big deal. But he won 49% of the vote. 49%. It's hardly a resounding rejection of what
*  he stood for or how he governed the country. That's just a partial list. The rise of these
*  right-wing populist parties and politicians is happening in many countries in many contexts.
*  It's coming in wealthy countries and poor ones, in places with high levels of immigration and low
*  levels, in countries with a lot of economic inequality and much lower inequality. This is
*  not just an American dilemma, not just a French one, not just a Swedish one or Brazilian one.
*  And so we need theories that explain more than one country or more than one situation.
*  Which brings me to Pippa Norris. She's a comparative political scientist at the Kennedy
*  School of Government at Harvard. And in 2019, she and her co-author, the late Ron Engelhardt,
*  published what I've come to see as really crucial text for thinking about the rise of global populist
*  authoritarians. It's called Cultural Backlash. And I asked her on the show this week to explain it.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at NYTimes.com.
*  Pippa Norris, welcome to the show. Thank you so much, Ezra. Pleasure to be here.
*  Tell me about the silent revolution in cultural values.
*  So this is very much part of the legacy of Ron Engelhardt, who we sadly lost from the University
*  of Michigan. He was observing what was happening in the 1970s. That's how he started his work.
*  And he went to Paris and saw people on the streets, young people, workers, everybody out
*  demonstrating and protesting. And then he looked around, in particular, at Washington, where again,
*  the anti-Vietnam movement was going, and also in Tokyo, where there were also protests in London.
*  And he said something is going on. And it's a younger generation in particular, and the
*  college-educated who are leading the charge, along with an alliance of workers and other groups.
*  And his prediction was that in the 1940s and 50s, as countries emerged from the Second World War,
*  in particular in Western Europe and in post-industrial societies, there was a basic
*  sense that what was important there was materialism. In other words, growth, economic goods,
*  better housing, better welfare states, making sure there were pensions and national health services,
*  and those sorts of things. And particularly amongst the generation that went through the war,
*  our parents and our grandparents, those who suffered from the Great Recession and Depression,
*  the instability of Hitler, Mussolini, and all the changes involved with the rise of fascism,
*  the Second World War, which disrupted lives. In that context, people wanted security. That was
*  their priority. And they would join, for example, trade unions in order to negotiate better wages,
*  if they were in blue collar work. And they would increasingly buy their houses and try and get
*  economic prosperity if they were middle-class professionals, teachers, people like that.
*  The younger generation, however, that subsequently grew up, in particular those who lived in their
*  early years in the 60s and 70s, had a very different set of experiences. They could say
*  for granted that there was a certain level of economic prosperity. Remember, there was
*  technology that was taking off in that era. There were blue collar workers who were increasing their
*  wage packets. People could afford the nice things in life and they could go to college,
*  which was a major revolution throughout Europe. As a result, they started to prioritize other things.
*  And this is exemplified by the new social movements, think in the 60s and 70s.
*  And so it wasn't just sex that was being invented, according to many observers,
*  but many other things. The environmental movement, for example, and protests about
*  climate change. There were changes in terms of protests about nuclear weapons and the old idea
*  of military strength and defense. And there was movements in particular for women in order to get
*  women's equality, the second wave women's movement, and of course the rise of the LGBTQ
*  movement as well. And all of these, Ron basically said, were part of a single pattern. And they led
*  to new parties. And in particular, what he predicted in that period was that this generation
*  that was concerned with what he termed post-material issues, the quality of life,
*  the ways in which we can improve our living standards, took for granted material affluence.
*  And so they moved on to other issues and other values, which they regarded as much more important,
*  in particular freedom and autonomy, the ability to live your own life and to enjoy diverse
*  lifestyles, to enjoy gender fluidity, for example, not simply fix gender roles or fix sex roles in the
*  family. It became much more of a secular focus rather than religion, much more of a cosmopolitan
*  focus rather than one that was based on nationalism or nativism. And so a generation grew up. And you
*  can think about the hippies and a wide range of other movements around that period that challenged
*  traditional values. Now, the silent revolution was such because it was a gradual process. It wasn't
*  one which produced that many changes that were that visible, but it was one that gradually rather
*  like a rat in a python went through the population. As the older generations died out gradually,
*  just through natural causes, as they were replaced by their children and the younger generations,
*  so values in society as a whole started to change. And that cultural cleavage, that basic division,
*  started to be apparent in parties and in the issues that were being debated in politics as well.
*  And so the old left-right cleavage between socialist parties, social democrats, labour parties on the
*  left in favour of high levels of public spending, generous welfare states, and probably moderate to
*  high taxation to an egalitarian system on the one side, and on the other side the conservatives,
*  the Christian democrats, and other parties who are European liberals who favoured fiscal prudence,
*  low taxation, and low public spending. That basic economic cleavage was no longer as important
*  as the emerging cultural cleavage over a wider range of new issues. And again, you can think
*  about America as an example of this. And so think back to the 1960s and 70s. And you have those like,
*  for example, Nixon, who were actually fairly liberal on many issues towards women and child
*  care and welfare policies, and indeed the Republican Party at that time, many were in favour of
*  reproductive rights and abortion. And on the left you had democrats, particularly those who are
*  socially liberal in progressive areas, as well as democrats who are more conservative from the
*  solid South. And so the new cleavage started to remake political parties, party competition,
*  and the issues which were critical in elections and campaigning and so on. So the silent revolution
*  was a fundamental change in the basic level of society, which percolated up and gradually
*  produced new issues, new parties, and new party leaders as well. Walk me through a couple of the
*  pieces of evidence you find strongest here. If you were looking for, let's call it three data points
*  that in the way they shifted from 1950 to 2020 or 1970 to 2020,
*  that show the way politics has changed, what would they be?
*  So we can think of the key issues. One would be something like women's equality and the idea that
*  you remember after the Second World War, people went back to their traditional lifestyles. In the
*  middle of the war, there were Rosie the Riveter and women were engaged in heavy industry,
*  reducing the bombs. Immediately afterwards in the 1950s, we had real constraints and think about
*  Betty Friedan, for example, and the way that she described the role of housewives at that time.
*  But in the 60s and 70s, when civil rights in America was taking off, and when feminism was
*  taking off, basically the women were saying, look, we're actually being excluded from some of these
*  new social movements, we need to demand equal pay. And of course, at that time, there were major
*  developments in things like equal pay acts and sex discrimination acts in many liberal democracies,
*  as well as in the United States. And gradually, the idea that women should have an equal role in
*  management in the professions, and that there should be much more flexible sex roles in the home,
*  that came to be accepted. That's normal. That's pretty much widely accepted in most of the
*  established liberal democracies. Second trend, in similar ways, much more secular, but secularization,
*  the decline of religion. And again, with Ron Ingelhardt, I wrote a book on that, sacred and
*  secular. And as increasing security came about, so religion no longer seemed to be as important in
*  people's lives. And you can see that through church going, but you can also see that in terms
*  of religious identifications. And it particularly started in the earlier decades amongst the
*  Protestants in Europe, which had been the established church, of course, in many places,
*  and where the church pews gradually emptied out. But it gradually also then affected the Catholic
*  Church, and that was accelerated by changes and scandals within the Catholic hierarchy.
*  So, secularization is a dramatic change. It starts at different levels in different countries.
*  In fact, the United States was rather late to come to this trend, but it's clearly going on.
*  If you look, for example, at Gallup or Pew. But in most West European countries, you can look at the
*  Eurobarometer, you can look at Pew surveys, you can look at the World Values Survey, and the
*  proportion who see themselves as religious shrinks and shrinks over successive decades. In particular,
*  what's left, it's the older populations who still, to some extent, attend church in Europe, but it's
*  a very small minority now on a regular basis. By the way, people still often have a religious
*  identity, if you ask them. They will say, for example, I'm Methodist, or I'm Catholic, or
*  whatever their religious faith is. But it's no longer vital to their lives in the way it might
*  have been in earlier decades. And then as well as that, we can think of other issues like climate
*  change and the environment. And again, it was a small group with the Silent Spring. It was a small
*  group who was concerned about recycling, and very, very minor support for Green parties, who were
*  often not able to break into parliament in the 60s and 70s. But it gradually took off, until
*  nowadays, of course, it's one of the key issues of our time. If you look at the most important
*  problem in most countries, as we've seen from the headlines in today's papers from the UN report,
*  everybody is aware of the consequences. Everybody is living through the consequences of climate
*  change. And so again, that is a major development, which has altered our politics, and also society
*  as a whole, and our basic attitudes towards social values, what we think is important for us, our
*  families, our governments, and our country. There's something that you touched on briefly
*  that I've come to think of as much more important here than people recognize, which is that
*  this is generational, that this change in values was not a process of persuasion,
*  equally distributed across society, where you convinced 40% of the baby boomers and 40% of
*  Gen Xers and 40% of millennials, but that it is successive generations showing sharply different
*  views about politics and cultural questions and what is important in life than each other.
*  Talk to me a bit about that process and distinction.
*  So generational change is a really powerful force. It's like a tide, which is moving in a
*  single direction. And where a generation changes, we're saying it's not a life cycle effect. A
*  life cycle is, for example, an attitude that you might be saying more liberal when you're younger.
*  And then as you settle down, get married, have kids, have a house, you might get more conservative,
*  and then maybe more conservative in later years as well as you retire. But this is a different
*  idea. This is that you get your formative values and attitudes and norms, the basic things that
*  you think are important in life, when you're in your socialization process, and that's during
*  your formative years. So in childhood, and in your adolescence, and as you start to enter the
*  workforce. Often, for example, the first party that you vote for in the past used to be the party that
*  you would continue with. And these values are things which you learn from different role models.
*  And so it could be teachers and schools and classmates. It could be your family and your
*  neighbors and your community. And it could be values at the level of your society. And those
*  values then stick with you in later life. You become much less fluid. You don't really adapt
*  nearly so much once you're in your 30s, your 40s, and so on. So young people growing up in the
*  interwar years, at a time of austerity, at a time of incredible economic uncertainty, poverty.
*  Think about the Dust Bowl region in the United States. Think about the lines for unemployment
*  in Western Europe. Think about the disruption of Germany after the war. In all of those cases,
*  when you grew up in those circumstances, you prioritized security. You prioritized stability.
*  You wanted often a strong leader who can provide you with order and economic growth, that basic
*  idea. But for the younger generation, they could take those things for granted. And often, by the
*  way, Ron Ingleheart took on the idea from Maslow of a hierarchy of values. And Maslow thought of
*  this as an individual where you had various basic physical needs, water, food, security, etc. Once
*  you fulfilled those, you can go on to other needs such as those for aesthetic life or other types of
*  recognition or status. And what Ron did and what was so brilliant in his early work, which he
*  published in 1977 on the silent revolution, was to apply that not to individuals, but to societies.
*  So if somebody grew up, for example, in Sweden, in those era of the 1960s and 70s, their lifestyle,
*  the things they took for granted, the values that were imbued from that were very liberal, very much
*  ones of social tolerance, social trust, a belief in the state and the state should run things in
*  terms of public services, that was taken for granted. But the idea also of a confidence that
*  their lives weren't just within a country but were cosmopolitan, that they could be part of Europe and
*  had a European identity. They could work and live and travel in many places. And their lifestyles
*  were just very, very different to their parents, who in turn were very different to their
*  grandparents. And as the older generation, as I said, gradually declined in terms of the population,
*  still very important as a group, still by the way voting very highly, but as they were gradually
*  replaced in the population by the younger generation, so values in society changed overall.
*  Think about things like attitudes towards gay marriage. Again, even as recently as Obama,
*  people didn't really talk seriously about the idea of legalizing marriage equality. And now in
*  many, many countries, it's taken for granted. Think about issues of say marijuana and that use,
*  which was liberalized first in many European countries like the Netherlands, and is now of
*  course increasingly available throughout the US states and is taxed like alcohol and so on. So
*  values and attitudes and lifestyles changed on a generational basis as younger people became gradually
*  more secure in their formative years. And as older people gradually died out as a proportion of the
*  population. This can feel upon hearing it almost like a title pattern. Of course, every generation
*  is more liberal, more tolerant, more open than the one that came before it. But a point you and the
*  late Ron Ingelhardt make in your work is that this isn't true, certainly not at this speed.
*  Can you talk a bit about the way this generational change we've seen
*  has been different than what has been the norm throughout history?
*  Yes. In particular, it can, as you say, seem like a deterministic theory of modernization,
*  which is rather outdated. If you look around the world, you see different paces of change.
*  But nevertheless, it is a broad, as it were, a Gulf Stream moving in one direction,
*  but it can move back and forward. And clearly those who are carried in these powerful forces
*  can also move back and forward depending on circumstances. So for example, think about the
*  economic crisis of 2008. Suddenly, people who had bought their own homes found themselves not able
*  to afford the mortgages. Young people who might have assumed that they could easily get a job once
*  they finished college, or if they just left school, found immediately there was high levels of
*  unemployment. And a lot of people who thought that they were safely middle class suddenly found
*  themselves moving backwards, that their pensions or their savings no longer really meant what they
*  thought they had. And so you can, for a time, have a period effect in which the whole of society
*  is suddenly pushed backwards, either economically or, think again, about 9-11 and the way in which
*  that made Americans suddenly feel a genuine sense of insecurity from terrorism. So events matter.
*  Generational changes are long-term. Events are short-term period effects. But again, we would
*  expect a period effect to have a short-term, as it were, blip. So everybody in that society might
*  move back towards demanding economic growth if there's a recession, or cutbacks in inflation,
*  as we now see when prices are rising so much for groceries, or changes in security, or changes in
*  their attitudes towards immigrants when new events come onto the stage. But it doesn't still change
*  differences between the older generations and the younger generations. You can think of it almost
*  like a layer cake. Everybody might move back towards demanding a different role for government
*  and greater security at that time, depending on the nature of the threat as perceived. But still,
*  the older generation tends to be the ones that is the most socially conservative, and the younger
*  generation are the ones which tend to be the most liberal. We've been talking a lot about the younger
*  generations and how they're changing, how they're becoming more post-materialist, more culturally
*  liberal. But I also want to talk about that other group, the older generation, because these shifts
*  are happening generationally. And that leaves a whole segment of the population who are, or at
*  least feel themselves, to be left behind by these trends. So tell me about that group and how they've
*  been reacting. So again, in the 1950s, things which were central to people's identity, like
*  patriotism and nationalism towards one's country, issues of religion and belief in God, and that the
*  church played a central role in people's lives, attitudes towards marriage and the family and
*  children within that traditional unit, attitudes towards what it meant to be an American, or what
*  it meant to be Swedish, or what it meant to be British. All of those things were seen by many of
*  the older generations and the socially conservatives to be under threat. They were no longer the 60%
*  of the population adhering to those values. They were no longer the 50%. Instead, in society as a
*  whole, as liberalism gradually expanded, they found themselves to be increasingly in a minority. And
*  so those views, which were very much led by younger college-educated and other social progressive
*  groups in society, were really fundamental social shifts. But what Ron Ingelhardt's Silent Revolution
*  theory had neglected to really emphasize at the time was that many people lost out from these
*  developments. Many people felt that the things which they took for granted, the things which they
*  regarded as important for themselves and their community and their country, those things were
*  being lost. And as a result, you saw increasing support for what we term in our book authoritarian
*  populist parties. And this is a group which you can call them radical right. That's a very common
*  way of labeling them. But they're not always right-wing in economics. Sometimes they're fairly
*  positive towards public spending, for example in Scandinavian countries. What distinguishes them
*  is that they really want to restore and push back against social liberalism or, as we call it in the
*  contemporary parlance in the media, the woke agenda. And so you can see many countries which
*  have got the parties who've been standing up for many traditional values. For example, on welfare,
*  if you look in France, in Italy, in Sweden, many authoritarian populist parties, the Sweden Democrats,
*  the brothers of Italy or the National Front or National Rally as they're now known in France,
*  all of these parties in particular push back on the diversity which comes from immigration.
*  But they also have a larger agenda. They also push back sometimes on issues which concern
*  reproductive rights and so anti-abortion laws, for example, which were passed, say in Poland.
*  They also push back on LGBTQ and the rights of those groups and particularly transsexual
*  rights is something which has been a bet noir for many of these parties. And they also push back
*  on globalization and thus the European Union. And so they really want to restore national borders
*  and nativism benefits for those who are born in the country rather than having the diversity
*  which has come about through increasing waves of immigration and the liberal values which have been
*  the result of generational changes. So these parties are the parties which have been growing
*  in votes, growing in seats, sometimes entering government in European countries
*  and really changing the nature of European politics in remarkable ways.
*  AC I want to sit in this for a minute because I want to try to spend some time on the psychology
*  of this political tendency which I don't think we describe well. And let me try something on you.
*  I think there's one level of it that is very easy to see in polling. And so those of us who look at
*  a lot of polling tend to fixate there. So you'll see that attitudes on immigration are very related
*  to say support for Donald Trump or some of these other parties in Europe and we'll say,
*  okay, it's an anti-immigrant right. Or there's just a set of polls that came out today that I
*  saw from the pollster Perry Undom showing that opinions on Black Lives Matter are extraordinarily
*  predictive in America of which party you're going to vote for. As you can begin to assemble a set of
*  policy ideas. So maybe we'll call that level one. And then there is this sort of backlash level
*  that you're talking about, which is this sense that you are losing power, that the world is
*  being changed against you, that you don't have the capacity to speak, that you have to be silent.
*  I think this is why there's so much power in free speech arguments because people do have a sense.
*  I know people in my own life who have a sense in their own day-to-day existence despite the
*  fact that they are not in politics in any professional capacity, that the things they
*  have always believed have become verboten to say. They are sort of culturally dismissed.
*  And so there can be a backlash effect in that, a feeling it often gets described as a feeling
*  of losing power or losing hegemony. When I was reading your book though, another word was used
*  in passing, disorientation. And I've been thinking a lot about that word because the people I know
*  who are of this political tendency, what I hear most often from them is a kind of disorientation,
*  that the way all this change is experienced across a variety of domains from how many
*  immigrants there are to what you can say about race to gender fluidity, all the way up to things
*  like inflation and the Fed and quantitative easing, there's just this constant sense of
*  disorientation, which is also why I think the generation gap dimension is very important
*  because as you get older, and particularly if you're older without a lot of tethers into society,
*  right, maybe you don't work anymore, you don't see the people you used to see,
*  it just feels like things are changing very rapidly. And what often seems to me to unite the
*  parties that respond to this tendency is a kind of promise that they will solve disorientation
*  by making things the way they were. America, we're going to make America great again. We're
*  going to have an economy built on manufacturing and coal. It has materialistic appeals at times,
*  but also appeals around gender and gender identity and race. But at its core, it's a kind of
*  nostalgic promise that you won't have to feel like your own country has changed in a way that
*  you don't recognize it and it doesn't recognize you. No, that's absolutely right. That's exactly
*  what's going on. And in particular, a nostalgia for the past because after all, we're talking
*  about people's social identities. You can disagree about things like taxing and spending, but you can
*  cut the pie in lots of different ways and we can kind of agree to disagree. But when it comes to
*  issues of what you can say, for example, what is socially acceptable in terms of race and ethnicity,
*  or what's socially appropriate in terms of issues of gender or sexuality, then in a sense,
*  it's really getting at the heart of who you are, who you feel that your identity is, what you can
*  be proud of, what your status is in that society, and what your moral values are. So a lot of these
*  debates are bitter because it's really us, them. Instead of being able to find a common ground for
*  compromise, as you can on economic issues, cultural issues are the ones which really get to the heart
*  of who people see themselves as and how they see their community, how they see their country.
*  And I think what's worth emphasizing here, Ezra, is it's not simply a psychological change,
*  nor is it simply something which is changing in elites, like in Hollywood media or in journalism
*  or in representation, but it's a real change in people's lives. It's a change that they realize
*  is happening around them. They know that. They know that the clock really can't be turned back,
*  and yet they hanker to at least respect that old forms of social status which they had when they
*  grew up and which is really part of their own lives. Give the example of Brexit. Brexit is a
*  fascinating development. After all, Britain had been a member of the European Union for 40 years.
*  It had been pass and parcel. They were our closest trading partners in Britain. And yet,
*  the way that it was sold in many ways during the referendum by those who were in favor,
*  including Boris Johnson, was very much a return to Britain's greatness on the world stage.
*  Boris Johnson didn't see Brexit as making Britain cut off. He saw it instead as a new way of
*  reasserting almost back to the days of the Second World War and empire, where Britain was one of the
*  major world players. One of the repeated statements was, the British economy is the fifth largest in
*  the world. And much of the framing was about making Britain great again, just like the phrases there
*  in American language for the Trump rhetoric as well. So people wanted to respect the old ways of
*  doing things and to hanker after the things that they realized they actually were losing.
*  It isn't just culture wars. It isn't just a cancel culture. It's a fundamental change in the nature
*  of how society works and what the attitudes and what the values are. And these parties have come
*  in and said, look, you need a voice. And we're going to speak for you. The establishment,
*  the old parties, the mainstream, the Christian Democrats, the social Democrats, they don't care
*  about you, but we do. And always again, when Trump had his inaugural, you so remember that he
*  depicted a place where the establishment was corrupt. The establishment was working for its
*  own interest to get back into power and to pass things which they felt was appropriate.
*  But at the same time, America was in crisis and the culture was in crisis. And he would defend the
*  silent majority. He would defend the average American. He would stand there and be a strong
*  leader, pushing back against all of these other forces and thereby restoring respect, if you like,
*  for many of those who felt that they were no longer respected in American society and their
*  views were no longer respected. They were just beyond the pale. I want to try to untangle what
*  you might think of as the materialist and the post-materialist appeal of some of these
*  politicians and parties. And this is a very live debate here. Now you have a much broader set of
*  global examples and knowledge, so you can tell me how well it tracks elsewhere. But there is on the
*  one hand an argument, you'll hear this quite a bit, that what's really underestimated about the
*  appeal of Donald Trump, maybe even Arundhaya Santosh or others like him, Brexiteers, Boris Johnson,
*  is that they are jettisoning some of the really unpopular materialistic views of the conservative
*  parties that they come to represent. In Donald Trump's case, promising not to cut Medicare and
*  Social Security, saying it was a lie, but saying that he would raise taxes on people like himself.
*  You'll hear an argument that all those things that people experience as Trumpism are actually
*  negatives. And why he is an effective politician is if he actually takes on more popular policy
*  views, whether or not he follows through on them than people realize. But at the same time, there
*  is a transgressive aesthetic that seems to reoccur among many of these politicians. You can see Ron
*  DeSantis trying to ape it and learn it from Donald Trump as many other Republicans are. You can see
*  it in Bolsonaro, you can see it in a different way in Boris Johnson, a lot of people who are involved
*  in Brexit. You can see a lot of media figures in these countries. Can you talk a bit about the role
*  of the transgressive aesthetic and what role that plays in responding to this politics of
*  cultural backlash? So the transgressive ways of working is reflected in all sorts of aspects
*  of populism. It's kind of part of its rhetoric and its appeal. You know, leaders who can put their
*  feet on the desk, who can swear in public as we think about, for example, Duterte and the language
*  which he would use in the Philippines, or who wish to challenge the power of the state and the
*  establishment, those who have tried to really criticize, in particular, many public servants
*  and civil servants in many cases, or who push back on experts. There was a famous phrase in Britain
*  by Michael Gove once who said, experts who need experts. And the idea that we don't need these
*  authorities, that these so-called authorities, whether they're in COVID or whether they're in
*  other aspects of trying to run economic policy, don't really speak for the people. And if we can
*  somehow tap into something which is just the ordinary people. And by the way, this is all
*  quite coded, who is meant as the ordinary people is often meant as the groups who are white and who
*  are born in that country. And of course, the diversity is kind of overlooked. So some people
*  are seen as effectively Swedish or Italian or British, but not others. But all of those groups,
*  these leaders appeal to in fundamental ways. And as you say, what's happening in the competition is
*  you can think of this as left-right on the economy, and you can think of this as socially
*  conservative and liberal on cultural issues. And what many populist leaders have done is they've
*  gone towards the kind of left center on the economy. And so they may be in favor, for example,
*  as Boris Johnson was, of leveling up for the northern areas. Leveling up was the idea that
*  we put more money into, say, Newcastle and Liverpool to try to make sure that the benefits of London
*  were actually there in the north of England as well, where of course the Red War was where
*  the conservatives made gains. And you can see similar processes where other parties, again,
*  are in favor of welfare and in favor of strong education and strong health care. And that's
*  particularly common, for example, the Sweden Democrats are along those lines, and the Norway
*  Progress Party always favor a strong welfare state. But they also want really to again go back in
*  terms of socially conservative views on many of the other cultural issues which they feel
*  they've been excluded from. I want to draw out the rationality of that view a little bit,
*  because I think that there's a direct logic to it that is often missed. If you feel the culture
*  has turned on you, if you feel that what is sayable and what is respectable is being enforced by
*  institutions and experts who no longer care for you and what you think, then the need for politicians,
*  for leaders who gleefully reject the gatekeeping capacity of those institutions and experts becomes
*  very intense. I think this is something that is sometimes missed about some of these politicians
*  that people don't like, in my view, generally, some of Trump's excesses, his cruelties,
*  the way he acts. Some do, obviously, some find it very thrilling, but many don't. But even many who
*  are comfortable with it appreciate that him and others like him don't seem cowed, because they're
*  cowed. They feel cowed. And they feel some of their leaders have been cowed. People maybe agree with
*  them but won't really say it aloud. And then somebody comes out and says, Mexico isn't sending
*  good people here, and we shouldn't let them send people here anymore and just build a wall and be
*  done with it. It's like, yeah, that guy. And that there's something about in a lot of these different
*  places, the aesthetic of transgressiveness being a kind of a reflection of a commitment or reflection
*  of an unwillingness to not be cowed when the main problem some of these people are voting or feeling
*  is a feeling of being cowed. There's like a more direct relationship there that makes transgressiveness
*  a more essential part of the cocktail than I think people who believe maybe these parties could
*  reemerge as economically liberal, socially conservative, but nevertheless genteel are missing.
*  Yes, that's absolutely right. And it's essentially being part of the outgroup, the group of kids at
*  school who are always excluded and picked upon and bullied and all that sort of thing. And if you have
*  a strong leader who says, I'm for you, I'm defending this tribal identity, I'm defending the
*  traditional values that you believe, I respect your values, I stand for you and I speak for you.
*  Then of course, that leads a direct appeal. And think about some of the symbolism, for example,
*  Victor Orban, when he speaks, he's used language, which is really frowned upon in the European
*  Union. He says, for example, that Hungary does not want to be a mixed race country, which is really
*  controversial in Europe. He's demonized immigrants, he's used anti-Semitic language
*  and restricted the rights of the LGBTQ community. He criticizes the EU very openly as well.
*  And so in all of those ways is transgressive and people are outgroups, the groups of kids at school
*  who were never part of the fashionable clique, they feel, okay, maybe the traditional establishment
*  don't like me, maybe traditional parties don't speak to me, maybe the middle classes who've
*  taken over politics and the media and college education in particular and the changes which
*  that's produced, maybe other people can speak for me instead. And that's very much part of
*  their appeal, I think. Now, transgressive leaders often tend not simply to transgress in terms of
*  their personal style or their language, but then to start to also, once they get elected and into
*  office, they start to transgress in terms of democratic norms. So they'll push back on some of
*  the niceties and they will rather overlook them. For example, making patronage appointments to the
*  courts of friends or partisans who they support or basically breaking the law. There have been so many
*  corruption scandals amongst some of these parties, some of which have brought down the leader
*  and some of which we've seen a revival after that. If we think about some of the cases,
*  there are many court cases for some of the leaders which have been a fundamental problem.
*  Or we can think of other ways in which these parties have pushed back on freedom of the press
*  and also increasingly tolerance of violence. Now, are all the parties accepting these pushing backs
*  on democratic liberal values? No, they're not. Some of them have actually moderated their views,
*  partly to get into coalition. And that's an important difference, I think, between
*  majoritarian systems like the United States and the United Kingdom and coalition governments,
*  which are much more common in Europe with proportional representation.
*  So in a winner-take-all, if you're going to be transgressive in your leadership style,
*  then it's often the case that presidents will try to also go for executive aggrandizement,
*  pushing back on liberal democracies and liberal norms, basically. In coalition governments,
*  what we often find is that where populist parties get into power, they often tend to moderate their
*  language and they moderate their policies and they also don't push back so much on liberal democracy
*  because that's how they can actually get a coalition together with some of their centre-right
*  parties and then they make some gains on certain issues like immigration issues and immigration
*  policies and restrictions. So there are differences there, but transgression is a common aspect of
*  populism, a very common aspect indeed, even on things like accents and language.
*  These values changes, as you describe, have been happening for many decades, and you can see the
*  kinds of politicians you describe also arising over these decades. In America, I think the classic
*  forerunner to Donald Trump, as an example, is Pat Buchanan. But in your data and telling,
*  something happens around 2010 that is like a step change in the success of this populist
*  authoritarian tendency. Tell me why you locate that in 2010 and then what you think the cause of it is.
*  So, as you say, these are long-standing parties. They were parties in the 1950s,
*  left over from the Second World War, which were neo-Nazis, often banned as hate groups or made
*  illegal, for example in Germany. They were parties in the 1970s. The Front National,
*  or the National Rally, as it's now called, with Marine Le Pen, is actually celebrating its 50th
*  anniversary. And you can see similar patterns like the British National Party in the 1970s.
*  But they were always marginalised. They were always below thresholds to actually achieve
*  seats. They may gave 4% of the vote, 5%, but it wasn't sufficient in order to have any sort of
*  numbers, still less to have any sort of power in a coalition, still less to be the largest party in
*  government. So what changed, I think, was a number of precipitating developments and also some of the
*  dissatisfaction, which is a long-term trend. So there's been a period of de-alignment in party
*  politics, in many post-industrial societies, and that can be dated again from the 60s and 70s,
*  when what happened was that the mainstream parties in the centre-right and the centre-left,
*  so the Christian Democrats, the Conservatives, the Liberals, Social Democrats, Socialists,
*  and so on, they gradually lost support. They were at their height in the 1950s. They went down from
*  the 1960s, progressively the 70s, progressively the 80s, and party systems fragmented. The old
*  loyalties were lost. For example, union workers would normally always support socialist parties
*  and communist parties in Europe, whereas the petit bourgeoisie and the middle classes
*  would by and large, particularly in the private sector, support the Conservative parties.
*  But those class identities weakened in Europe, and the basis, the kind of foundations of party
*  politics, became much looser. People were more willing to move around in different elections
*  or to vote for one thing, for a local election, something else, for a national election, and so on.
*  So this provided opportunities for smaller parties, and it provided it both on the
*  progressive side, like the Greens, who suddenly started to move up, as well as the support for
*  the radical right or populist parties. And it takes time. All of these are processes where,
*  once you get a few members of parliament, you get a bit more of a platform, you get more credibility.
*  People don't want to waste their vote. They need to have some sense of what the party stands for,
*  and if it's always just the major parties standing for campaigning, they have very little idea,
*  particularly if they're demonised as being very extreme and outside the pale,
*  people are not going to vote for populists. But gradually what's happened is that the populists
*  themselves have become much more savvy at presenting a more moderate image on many issues.
*  For example, many of the European populist party most recently, after Brexit, have stopped saying
*  and stopped being explicitly anti-European Union. They said that that policy really wasn't the one
*  that was giving them support, and it was simply alienating them from the other mainstream parties
*  as well and from many voters. So by making their more extreme elements, the real hate groups and
*  the groups who are really using extremism in politics, by excluding those and by appealing
*  primarily on immigration, that was a rising issue in Europe, particularly remember the European
*  immigration crisis when Angela Merkel opened the door in about 2015, that led to a surge of migrants
*  along with the war in Syria, the war in Afghanistan and economic deprivation
*  and economic migrants from Africa. So the economic recession of 2008, the Eurozone crisis,
*  which followed with very deep consequences for Mediterranean Europe, and then the rise of migrants,
*  which is continuing, although that has gone down as an issue in Europe, all of those created very
*  favourable circumstances. And again, all of these changes are gradual processes. You get, for example,
*  10% of members of parliament, suddenly you might have a coalition partner, suddenly you're much
*  more visible, you also get access to public funds, and so for the next election you're likely to be
*  in a much larger position, much more effective position, in order to get elected in that. And so
*  we can see those developments, for example, Giorgio Maloney, Italy's first female Prime Minister,
*  leader of the Brothers of Italy, she's just got 26% of the vote, a quarter. Her party had roots
*  in fascism, but she abandoned that, and she sought to tone down the extremism and really be pro-European
*  union, even pro-NATO for Ukraine, but still anti-migrant and anti-immigrant, and she's
*  basically now leading the coalition with Berlusconi and with Matteo Silvani for the Lega party.
*  So the party became more respectable, the extremist image was less evident, and over a series of
*  elections, basically populist parties have gained in Italy. You can see the same in France if you
*  look at Marine Le Pen, and in the last presidential election of course Emmanuel Macron won, but Marine
*  Le Pen came second with 41% of the vote in the second round presidential election, up from 34%
*  in 2017, and you can see a steady rise in a series of presidential elections as well as
*  elections to the European Parliament. So gradually the party itself became more moderate, Marine Le
*  Pen became more effective as a campaigner, she abandoned her father's extremism, and with rising
*  de-alignment for the major parties and with rising disaffection with the major institutions, she has
*  a basis of support, and you can see similar patterns in Belgium as well as in many parts of
*  Central and Eastern Europe, Law and Justice for example, in Poland, in Turkey with Erdogan, in
*  Hungary of course with Fidesz achieving a substantial vote, majority of the votes, and two-thirds
*  majority in Parliament. In all these cases it's a gradual rise of minor parties and they become part
*  of the government, and then of course the other parties also are in decline. The centre has been
*  losing ground and it will not hold. One thing that you distinguish in the book is between supply side
*  explanations in politics and demand side, and so there's the supply side which you've been
*  explaining here, the party's somewhat changed, they trimmed their sales, they entered into new
*  coalitions, but there's also the demand side which you emphasize which is I think often
*  overlooked in politics. What do people actually want and why do they want it? What kind of
*  politician will they respond to if that politician or party arises? And you argue that in this period
*  we've been seeing profound demographic and cultural tipping points that are changing the appeal of
*  these politicians precisely because they are changing the desperation of voters for politicians
*  like these. These politicians in a way are the response to a market or even small d-democratic
*  demand. Tell me a bit about your thinking on tipping points. So as you say you have just like
*  in an economic market the demand side of the public and the electorate, the supply side which
*  is how the parties respond including the major parties in terms of issues, do they take them on
*  board or do they exclude them, and then you also have the regulations, you have the rules of the
*  game and that really is important for how successful some parties are versus others. So the idea of a
*  tipping point is that if you've got a group and again it can be on the environmental group as much
*  as the radical right group and they're only a small proportion of the electorate then in any
*  majoritarian system there's very little reason to necessarily cater to those because you already have
*  loyalists as your base and you have an established coalition amongst the groups who are going to
*  support you and therefore you can appeal to those. But if there's a tipping point and that
*  particular tipping point angers and alienates the group that was the formal majority so that they
*  become much more aware that the values and attitudes and identities they hold are no longer
*  necessarily in alignment with how the culture is moving then the politics of resentment comes
*  forward and that's exactly where the populace can tap into this. So obviously much of the
*  MAGA movement in America is premised on the idea of the demographic replacement
*  and this is that the urban areas are expanding, rural areas are contracting, the white population
*  is dramatically declining particularly in places like California as we see the rise in the number
*  of Hispanics and also African Americans and Black voters and so we can see substantial social changes
*  in class, in rural urban, in race and ethnicity, in religion and all of these are real changes in
*  society they're nothing that's being made up and as a result those groups who feel that their
*  their identity is based on those assumptions feel that they're losing out.
*  Let me pick up on something you mentioned there because when I look at the time frame we're
*  talking about this post-2010 period the thing that immediately comes to mind for me is the iPhone,
*  the rise of social media, increased competitiveness in the broader media and I think this is important
*  because there is the question of the ways the culture and society are changing but none of us
*  have access to the entire society or culture and most people aren't sitting around reading polls
*  about other people's opinions about cultural issues so there's this question of how do you end up
*  feeling like what leads somebody in a rural area of Wisconsin to feel like everything is different
*  now and it seems to me in a lot of places all around the world at the same time you have this
*  rise in algorithmic media in highly engagement oriented media that is constantly confronting
*  people with usually stories charged around identity in many cases at least that really give I think
*  often an outsized view of how quickly society is changing but nevertheless are a very very big part
*  of a very rapid set of changing views a sense that of what you can and can't say because people are
*  now yelling at you in the comments section of your own Facebook post something I felt was a
*  little bit under theorized in the book is this dimension of the changes in media 2010 is right
*  around then with the rise of smartphones is a signal event and in my experience of it it's a
*  signal event that tends to lead to people being confronted a lot more with whatever they fear most
*  about the country they live in and so the fact that that would lead to a rise in these populist
*  authoritarian figures seems pretty logical to me yes the book does not focus that much on
*  political communication but part of that is because I wrote an earlier book called digital divide which
*  really said that the internet which was taking off at the time started of course in around 1995 in
*  terms of the visual browser the internet is a tool and it can be used both positively and negatively
*  for democratic engagement for political communications and a variety of other things
*  so on the one hand clearly it allows anybody to break outside of their bubble if they were
*  focused in the past on their local newspaper or local television they can now see the events going
*  on for example they can watch live the Brazilian election on Sunday or they could have watched for
*  example Rishi Sunak when he was in parliament the other day as the first prime minister in his first
*  outing so it gives us a broader sense of information if you want that information
*  and if you have the skills and the cognitive ability and the education and the information to
*  make sense of it on the other hand if you simply want to listen to your own tribe and you want to
*  simply be in a media bubble and just have repetition of exactly the same messages
*  and the rise of misinformation and disinformation then of course you can do that as well so it's a
*  double-edged sword the role of social media in all of these processes does it reinforce
*  conspiratorial theories in the United States but also in Europe as well absolutely does it
*  reinforce misinformation and the pace and spread of misinformation both across borders and within
*  countries absolutely but is it primarily a driver of the support for authoritarian populace and there
*  I am somewhat more skeptical in some ways it seems like it's too obvious a brick that too obvious a
*  candidate to be blamed and it's so many other more socially profound shifts in society which I think
*  have caused these developments where the media including legacy media as well as social media
*  are more of a reflection of what's going on than a primary driver of what's going on.
*  Well let me try to take the other side of this argument for a minute because I think I'm more
*  convinced in the other direction so part of it is the way that these changes in media
*  also change the reality of political systems. I am skeptical Barack Obama becomes a Democratic
*  nominee and thus the President of the United States in 2008 and 2009 without social media
*  his campaign is the first to really use social media very very well and of course the amount
*  of money they're able to raise online is tremendous right he has to do something very hard in beating
*  Hillary Clinton that year take out social media I'm not sure he does it and if he doesn't do it
*  that also changes the way people sense society changing right Barack Obama is as you put in the
*  book a shock to the American political system and so for a lot of people the first black president
*  is a really transformational event that arouses a lot of let's call it cultural anxiety but
*  Donald Trump similarly I don't think Donald Trump becomes a Republican nominee without Twitter and
*  Twitter's sort of tremendous capacity to influence traditional media coverage so that's one level of
*  it that what is happening as candidates who are intensely supported by portions of the population
*  can get around some of the traditional ways you needed to go through gatekeepers to get coverage
*  that changes who can win and what kinds of things can be won then another level you mentioned here
*  about your book the digital divide and I think you put that a little bit on education right if
*  you're thoughtful and out there looking to use the internet to your own benefit and become a more
*  informed person and get more perspectives or you know you can use it a little bit thoughtlessly and
*  get surrounded in an echo chamber I think that's true obviously but I think we have a lot of evidence
*  at this point that education and intention may not be as relevant here as we wish they were
*  that particularly because of algorithmic media where it's not really just what you are choosing
*  but what the computer or the algorithm I should say is deciding you like you start getting
*  served up certain kinds of stories certain kinds of voices so I do think there's something too
*  about the ways in which people who are very into politics now have this way of getting
*  served up things that they are more and more into which in turn creates all these dynamics that I
*  think push people towards the edges and create a counter reaction among their opposition on
*  on the other side so I guess I'd put that as a as a provocation here isn't it at least plausible
*  that one of the shocks to the system is that all of a sudden these kinds of figures and ideas and
*  news stories and local news stories that once might have been somewhat marginalized now have
*  this capacity to go viral and to create the political context we're all living in I always
*  think of Bolsonaro supporters chanting Facebook at his victory speech I mean I think they they
*  were right about that so clearly social media has changed the nature of campaigning in many ways
*  returning back to its roots of one-to-one communication and one to a few in group
*  contexts etc and it's changed the nature of politics and it's changed the speed and the
*  distance those that those two things have both shrunk on any particular political event so
*  immediately you can know if something has happened and you can follow it along if you're
*  interested in that has it however changed attitudes values norms and political orientations
*  and it's there which I'm I just push back because it on the one hand it seems too easy to blame
*  social media and the rise of the internet on some of these phenomena which are in my view based on
*  deep roots in society rather than in just our processes of communication and of course journalists
*  love to point to twitter as the way that we all find out about information but of course if you
*  actually look we've included a whole bunch of new questions about social media use in the world value
*  survey in the last wave and when you ask people in most countries including in Russia but also
*  in India and also in in many western european countries where do you get your most common
*  source of information they all say television that's still the source now are they watching
*  television through their iphones perhaps but they're still watching the BBC or ITV or CNN or NBC
*  etc etc are they reading newspapers probably not but are they watch or reading an article from the
*  New York Times or the Washington Post or any of our legacy media absolutely are they also going
*  towards the fringe of politics and reading other things from QAnon which might not have been
*  available in the past yes but of course again we've always had for a long long period the rise of
*  the far right through um through radio so again it's an amplification and it's an expansion but
*  talk radio which was there for a decade at least before the internet also carried much the same
*  messages also reached a large audience and also created those sorts of senses of um tribal
*  communities as you can tune into one or tune into another depending on your political priors
*  so the internet reinforces accelerates doesn't necessarily i think change the bones of politics
*  doesn't change the ways in which we engage or how we get involved and speed in itself which
*  is vital to journalism is not necessarily how most people are are still simply responding to
*  politics as you know most people aren't watching the politics on twitter they're watching Adele
*  and things like that which are also on twitter so sometimes we exaggerate how much attention
*  because we're paying attention to these things we exaggerate how much everybody else is as well
*  oh i never think i should say this very very openly i never think the power of twitter or even
*  a lot of other social media is its direct role as a venue of political information it's that the
*  people who are providing political information and making political decisions in all the other
*  venues the elites of the media of politics uh of technology they're all jacked into twitter all
*  the time the the influence of twitter is that all the editors and uh producers on the cable news
*  networks and staffers for all the the politicians and donald trump himself and elon musk and that
*  they are disproportionately getting it and then using their sort of other influence channels
*  to increase the salience of the debates that that are dominant there but i think something
*  you brought up brings another very interesting counter argument to the four which is who's to say
*  we're in any kind of unusual period of cultural backlash at all i mean you go back into the 20th
*  century you have mussellini you have hitler you have father coglan you have all kinds of populist
*  authoritarian figures um who wielded much more influence than than these figures wield today
*  maybe what happened here is simply that it has been far enough since fascism and other kinds
*  of populist authoritarian uh movements were discredited such that some movements that have
*  more of this aesthetic can begin to reemerge in in in much the same way although obviously i have a
*  slightly different view on it that the fading of the soviet union has reinvigorated socialist
*  politics in in america both as a substantive uh direction and as a label because socialism isn't
*  quite the the slur it once was maybe the only thing aberrational here is this couple decade period
*  when these other tendencies were sufficiently discredited that politicians couldn't rise
*  through them and were just in a reversion to the historical mean yes i mean the starting point for
*  any trend is absolutely critical for its interpretation depending on whether you think
*  inflation or employment unemployment has got better or worse depends on what date you're picking and
*  so on so we certainly can look at the classic era of fascism and what we used to term totalitarian
*  governments of that particular era and the post-war era was certainly one which looked at that
*  extensively but also i think there is something new if we look around the world which we haven't
*  really mentioned is all the number of leaders in executive office who really have this broad
*  orientation we focused a lot on europe to some extent on the united states but let's think for
*  example india the most populist democracy which is backsliding and narendra modi emphasizing in
*  that case hindu nationalism against muslims the philippines until recently rodrigo duterte
*  turkey recap erdovan who started off fairly democratic but who's moved his country
*  increasingly after an attempted coup in an authoritarian direction and against the european
*  union venezuela nicolas maduro taking over from ugo chavez with a left-wing form of populism
*  argentina cristina fernandez de coxina peronists and a long tradition of course in latin america
*  amlo in mexico is another example there as is daniel ortega in terms of nicaragua who again
*  was seen as fairly democratic when he first came in increasingly authoritarian over successive
*  elections evo morales can be seen as a populist in slovakia and in balarus as well as hungary
*  poland the czech republic and there's even arguments which is expanding the notion but
*  maybe even vladimir putin is populist in certain ways he wants to he's clearly authoritarian he
*  has tremendous coercive powers and financial powers but he also wants to remain popular
*  amongst the russian public so this idea of populism depending on whether you have a
*  narrow or a broad notion if you look around the world it's much much broader than it was simply
*  in the era of muslimi and the era of franco and the era of of hitler it really has gone
*  viral in many places in many developing societies sometimes it's stable sometimes it's not sometimes
*  we see presidents moving up and down in in popularity or in and out of office but it
*  certainly seems to be a development which is increasing in power and rising as a threat to
*  liberal democracy and of course it goes hand in hand with democratic backsliding
*  the other major phenomena also of the period from 2010 to 2022
*  so
*  one other explanation you'll hear particularly in this period which you know 2010 is following
*  the financial crisis which was a global crisis is that this isn't about race it isn't about
*  cultural anxiety it's about economics the left of center or even traditional right of center parties
*  stopped delivering economically they had stopped for some time you had stagnating wages say in
*  america and then you had a big economic shock which fundamentally discredited them and what
*  is being drafted on here is frustration and that would also then imply a straightforward answer if
*  other parties can deliver economically that will drain the potency of these populist parties how
*  do you think about that both as a causal explanation for the post 2010 rise of the populist
*  authoritarian right and how do you think about it as a solution in 2015 when trump first started to
*  descend the golden staircase this was a popular explanation and political economists certainly
*  looked at areas of the country in europe and in the united states where manufacturing industry had
*  declined primarily as a result of chinese imports and certain areas such as textiles such as computers
*  and so on footwear and there was a correlation between the areas which trump did well at
*  and those areas of loss of manufacturing and similarly in europe it was the areas which had
*  lost the mining industries and extractive industries and so on problem is that this
*  economic explanation which appeared fairly plausible and is still advocated by some doesn't
*  appear so plausible when we look at it across countries some of the most affluent countries
*  in the world with very solid welfare states including norway sweden denmark switzerland
*  one of the most affluent countries again in europe the netherlands these have all got very strong
*  authoritarian populist parties swiss people's party progress parties freedom party of austria
*  etc so it's not simply the poorer areas of europe or the poorer countries of europe like bulgaria
*  or romania which have seen the rise of populism and also as soon as you go to the survey data
*  and you look at the individual level data we can ask people about their economic circumstances
*  we can monitor their class we can look at their income and their savings and how secure they feel
*  and when you do that what you find whether you're looking at support for trump in 2016 and 2020
*  or support for many of these parties in europe through the european social survey
*  is that the individual level economic indicators by and large don't predict whether somebody voted
*  for these parties basically class has been kind of flat other factors age and other factors like
*  ethnicity really trump this strength and significance of a class similarly in terms of whether you have
*  personal savings and there's also relative deprivation whether you feel you're better off
*  than your parents so economics um the jury is still a bit out i think but most of the evidence
*  seems to say it's cultural issues not economic issues which really are the cutting edge for why
*  voters swung towards these parties so then if simply delivering economically doesn't work
*  what does what does a post post material left do this is the challenge on economics clearly
*  the natural solution whether it was for biden or whether it's for kirstama in the labor party in
*  britain or for many other leaders of social democratic parties is to say well we'll just
*  go back and we'll improve the areas where we lost some votes and that means things like jobs
*  programs it means training it means expanding college access it means improving work opportunities
*  housing roads you know all of those things which are very familiar the assumption is that we can
*  follow social democratic policies expand all of these services improve rail transport for example
*  have leveling up improve educational opportunities particularly apprenticeship programs for example
*  for the less skilled so they don't necessarily need to go to a university but they can get
*  practical skills as plumbers electricians and so on and in the new green industries all of that
*  is a set of assumptions that social democratic parties on the left are very comfortable with
*  problem is that it's not clear that this is the driver of the support if it's the cultural issues
*  and the problem about the cultural issues is that the parties on the left are totally divided
*  internally on issues like reproductive rights on issues like diversity and immigration on issues
*  like changing immigration policies or backtracking for example on lgbtq rights it's impossible
*  for many of these parties to consider diluting or reversing some of those liberal gains
*  and they can't also thereby appeal to the classic working class base which is very much more
*  traditional and more conservative on those sorts of issues so they're stuck within a rock and a
*  hard place and i think this is their fundamental dilemma it's far easier for the parties on the
*  center right to adapt they can basically go into bed with the populist parties and they can change
*  the immigration policies which they have that's the big area where populist parties have made a
*  big success in western europe and they can also continue with their economic policies which are
*  fairly libertarian tax cuts and things like that and you know you can have a coalition which is
*  kind of accommodated but left parties have to go into bed with greens they can't basically have
*  any sort of compromise with the authoritarian populist parties it's just impossible in their
*  in their makeup but particularly if you understand a lot of what's happening here as a set of anxieties
*  not just a set of policies that would at least seem to me to open up strategies a little bit
*  different so i always think of obama as having been fairly masterful as a politician at this
*  i think now there is a tendency to look back at him and read him a little bit overly literally
*  that you know he didn't support gay marriage or uh you know had this or that position on immigration
*  but he really always paired in a very very explicit way this excitement about change
*  right hope and change change we can believe in with a constant effort to answer and reassure
*  cultural anxiety and it often seems to me that that one or the other gets chosen you you either
*  see politicians who are good at emphasizing how much change they are going to bring or even if
*  they're not good at it that's what they are doing so you might think of a um an alexandria
*  costio cortez who i think is very good at representing change or hillary clinton who is very
*  who talked very intensely about how much change she would bring and what it would mean for her
*  to be elected but don't do very much to try to reassure people who are nervous about the way the
*  world is changing or you can look at somebody i think like a joe biden and there are other figures
*  like him who are oriented at trying not to arouse too much anxiety around change right they they
*  want to try to keep their coalition together but they are there to be acceptable in a way
*  to voters who are outside the coalition it's very well established i think at this point
*  that the joe biden 2020 primary campaign wins on this theory of electability wins on a theory
*  that he'll be acceptable to other people and that theory actually turns out to be true
*  but that there is some kind of synthesis here for talented politicians where they are simultaneously
*  either themselves representing or able to tell a story of change while quite explicitly trying
*  to tell a story of why that does not have to leave people out but i do think there it looks
*  i don't win elections i've not done it but but i observe and report on politicians
*  and i have just noticed a kind of literalism creeping into it as if the the only variables
*  on the board are what literal positions you take on policies and i'm a policy guy and i
*  track policy positions and i track policies but you know joe biden has a lot of very popular
*  policies they're much more popular than the policies donald trump pushed and they have
*  functionally the same approval rating right now as the other one did at a similar point and there's
*  other confounding factors here i don't think it is so as impossible as people have begun to make it
*  sound to be optimistic about the future and conscious of the fact that many people are
*  fearful about the future now you have to be a very talented politician to do that
*  but you know you can always have to be a talented politician to change politics
*  but it does depend on the issue dimension so if we're talking about economics of course they're
*  promising a better life and prosperity and affluence and minimal pain that will go along
*  with that although of course under periods of inflation people do realize that there has to be
*  pain as well on foreign policy dramatic changes which they can implement in terms of internationalism
*  versus nationalism in terms of engagement in ukraine versus isolationism and so on so those
*  are things which you can see how politicians can promise certain deliverables and try to achieve
*  those and people can be confirmed but when it comes to culture i just think it's far more
*  difficult when it comes to immigration it's far more difficult to promise that on the one hand
*  you're going to make america great again you're going to make sweden swedish as people said in
*  in the democratic party there or that you're going to reverse some of the things which allowed these
*  populist parties to come to office i've been obsessed in the last couple of weeks of course
*  with the leadership contest in the conservative party as you might be able to tell in the uk yes
*  and i think about how the leadership has has changed right so on the one hand corbin suggested
*  radical economic change so radical that nobody would vote for him because he really was pretty
*  far left and he was kind of insular in how he how he saw that and boris johnson said get brexit done
*  so he promised to follow through on the referendum which was popular at the time or at least enough
*  popularity after johnson of course we had the six-week experience of liz truss who promised
*  radical change and everybody everything went nuts and it was basically a government of chaos
*  and inflation soared and the pound dropped and bottom markets went went mad and so on
*  and now of course what we have essentially if you saw this last prime minister's question time was
*  two politicians both of whom are very kind of sensible middle of the road somewhat boring
*  they do not want to promise much change they want to promise continuity restoration but
*  rishi sunak wants to say things are going to be stable and we're not going to have the
*  chaos of either trust or the drama and scandals of the johnson administration at the same time
*  whilst he's putting forward a number of different financial options to try and increase economic
*  stability and reduce economic instability he's not changing on immigration policy that's a legacy
*  of the previous administration with some fairly extreme measures and the simple reason why he
*  can't change on that is he feels if he does that the populist party will rush in and nijal farage
*  will come back to life and the conservatives will really be going into an election facing a moderately
*  sensible and solid labor party on the one side very popular 30 points ahead in the polls
*  in the recent period and then also being eaten on the far right by the anti-immigrant policies of
*  a nijal farage or any sort of um far right party at that side as well so some change is reassuring
*  but where populists say let's go backwards let's reassure by not having too much change
*  then it's very difficult to face both forwards and backwards on some of these classic issues
*  CB Let me ask about another cut there this cut between the cultural issues and the economic issues
*  this is something that has been on my mind a lot reading your work and just thinking about
*  the conversations I have with people about inflation I was talking earlier about disorientation
*  as an emotion here as a politically salient emotion a sense that things are changing they're
*  not right this isn't the country you knew and a lot of what I hear in inflation discourse sounds
*  much more like what I hear in what gets called cultural discourse than what I would understand
*  as normal kind of economic discussion something's going wrong you know we're losing you know the
*  the country and the economy we once had and it's made me think a bit about the ways you can have
*  materialistic and post-materialistic responses to economic issues so you might think of this as
*  like the paul ryan ron paul or mitt romney ron paul divide the economy wasn't great around 2012
*  it was coming back but it wasn't great and some people responded to that in the republican party
*  by saying we need mitt romney a sober private equity guy knows how to lead things knows how to
*  run a corporate office knows how to manage and others said we need ron paul you know we need to
*  go back to gold and I think both of these tendencies live in the the appeals of donald trump
*  but it makes me wonder a bit whether or not we overly code economics as materialistic because
*  oftentimes a lot of the debates about economics end up having this this implicit question
*  about whether or not what you're looking for here is like what you might call technocratic management
*  of the economy or what you're looking for is is a sense what you're feeling experiencing is a sense
*  that too much here has changed we used to know what we're doing and now we we've gotten away
*  from the wisdom of our forefathers and you know we need gold we need to to bind the federal reserve
*  you know we need not so much debt whatever it might be that there's a tendency to experience those
*  through the same lens of disorientation the same lens of too much has changed and it has robbed us
*  of of what makes us great and that sometimes the the the effort politically to try to answer
*  economic fears as simply economic as opposed to part of this larger miasma of of anxiety
*  and particularly generational anxiety is actually quite misguided no i think that's that is right
*  and that when we see prices rising so sharply in groceries and people's lifestyles when we see
*  the mortgage rate rising so that people are no longer able to renew their mortgages and
*  may have to lose their homes and we see other sorts of economic crisis then that is going to
*  create tremendous anxiety which is both cultural as well as purely materialistic and if you go
*  back to ron's early work he would say that when you get an economic crisis of course
*  there's rising importance and if you perceive it as an economic crisis whether it is or is not
*  for example in your family or in your community then it's genuine and then those material concerns
*  come back and you want basically competence in your government you want a government of technocrats
*  or at least the government that can deliver basic economic security once that's secured and you're
*  into a period of growth and prosperity or at least steady growth then that's the time in which these
*  other concerns rise to the surface and you can start to be concerned about the quality of life
*  and personal relationships and a wide variety of other aspects which are affecting society like
*  social cohesion or social order so the two things aren't isolated by any means they interact
*  one implication of framing much of this or understanding much of this as generational
*  conflict is it generations age out of the electorate yes and that's something you say
*  in the book that we might be in this lag on the one hand there's more cultural backlash because
*  the younger generations have gotten older they've gotten bigger and as such what used to be the
*  counterculture has become the culture and that's made what used to be the culture feel resentful
*  feel silenced and created a yearning for these transgressive strongman politicians who can put
*  things back the way they were we empower you make you feel safe in your own country again
*  but year by year the size of the millennials and then the the gen zers is getting bigger
*  and it sort of seems to me that you see what we're in as a kind of lag period between when
*  the younger generations are big enough for their politics to really dominate and the older
*  generations are small enough for their politics to be a more obviously minoritarian tendency
*  on the other hand ideas of demographic determinism have become quite unsafe in politics recently
*  probably given how wrong democrats were about what the browning of america would look like for them
*  so how do you see this are we in a lag should we expect this to just be a kind of period of
*  turbulence and then in in 15 years we'll have resettled into a new normal what's your projection
*  in the slightly longer frame so secular changes long-term changes by generation are pretty
*  evident you can see these patterns across many different societies across many different surveys
*  and across many different time periods where we have panel surveys and song and there are things
*  like greater secularization and there's a kind of religiosity which has been evident problem is that
*  generational changes take a long time to have any sort of effect and so when you're are changing as
*  we say with this tipping point where the majority population that once took for granted certain
*  values sees that they've become a large but still minority within their own societies when you've
*  become from 60 down to 50 down to 40 and coincidentally by the way almost most of the
*  indicators throughout trump's period in office showed that about 40 of the population consistently
*  in america supported him proved of him voted for him and so on when you become 40 but you still
*  out vote and you're still energized then you you're both angry and energized to be active
*  and you're still having some clout largely because the younger generation are not so active in
*  conventional politics as you become the 30 and the 20 you're much more likely to get a process
*  in which you feel you can no longer speak up because of social pressures here you come across
*  what elizabeth newell newman used to talk about self-censorship and so for example racist attitudes
*  that could be expressed say decades ago in the 50s are no longer acceptable in society and then
*  you yourself no longer feel that you can say things once you become a small minority but of course
*  again that takes a long time and the real question for me is this can we actually get to that
*  demographic change or by the time in particular the united states get to that is the political
*  system and democracy as we know it going to be so changed by those who have politicized the refusal
*  to accept the decline that we can no longer have effective political representation and there are
*  so many indicators of that which everybody is aware of where candidates increasingly no longer
*  say that they will accept the results if they lose where we see changes to laws which are going to
*  minimize some of the demographic changes or attempt to minimize them for example for minority
*  communities when we see many other changes to the electoral system or to the political system
*  it's not clear to me that the long-term generational rise of liberal values which i do
*  think is happening and which there's solid evidence in the polls is necessarily going to trump
*  all these other aspects which are changing the political institutions in america and really are
*  weakening democracy and the public's faith in the norms of democracy in america and i think we can
*  see these changes also in again some other countries hungary being a case which clearly comes to mind
*  but many other also countries where increasing social intolerance as these changes occur lack
*  of social trust lack of trust in institutions lack of the glue that holds communities together
*  and holds countries together is increasingly becoming evident as these minority parties and
*  candidates and presidents come to power so it's really a question of long-term change yes but
*  politics gets in the way and other things may not hold in order to allow that representational
*  change to actually occur that again the jury is still out i think that's a good place to end
*  so always our final question what are three books that you'd recommend to the audience
*  so where does all of this leave us i think one of the big questions which i'm really fascinated
*  about and which i've been working on in recent months is to think about the basis of popular
*  support for authoritarian leaders the basis of support for attitudes towards democracy and
*  democratic norms and i think we're getting some new literature which really starts to look at that
*  and i'd like to recommend three firstly when we think about dictatorships like for example
*  putin in russia or many other cases lukashenko in by la rousse president xi in china we assume that
*  they're in power because they exert coercive power they have the control of the military the
*  police the security forces they can throw their opponents into jail or they have power which
*  arises from patronage state ownership licenses oligarchs they can distribute largesse and
*  corruption but the new literature really says maybe there's genuine support for authoritarian
*  strongman leaders who promise security and order and that many people may feel that that's a
*  priority not freedom and not the chaos that can be attributed to democracy so the first book
*  alizander matowski popular dictatorships he has used some really interesting new data
*  particularly from russia and from central eastern europe to say that maybe leaders have actually
*  really risen partly because of deep political and economic insecurity crisis by promising efficient
*  strong-armed rule tempered by some form of elections some form of popular debate maybe
*  leaders like putin have actually got public support behind them now we don't know for sure
*  it may be that the opinion polls aren't reliable that's entirely possible but i think that's a
*  really interesting new take on how we explain the rise of authoritarianism and the backsliding of
*  democracy in many countries around the world second book which builds on that is another good
*  book by serj guri off and daniel triceman and the book is called spin dictators and it's about the
*  changing face of tyranny in the 21st century and again it's going back to many of the dictators
*  and authoritarian regimes and saying what's the basis of their support well again in the past
*  it would be that there'd be a military coup d'etat as in mayenma and the generals would basically
*  come into power the same is true in egypt but increasingly what you find today is the use of
*  propaganda in a way that hasn't been used in the past propaganda has always been there it was there
*  for example with gobbles in germany it's been there with mussellini and use of radio and so on
*  but nowadays what we have is electoral authoritarian regimes and they've learned
*  that if they manipulate and fake democracy and they manipulate the information which is available
*  through censorship a traditional technique but also through very effective control again this can be
*  how they can maintain popular support and the last book is a classic it's not a modern study
*  but i think we now need to go back to read her and anna aren't and we need to read the origins of
*  totalitarianism and reflect on the developments of the 20s and the 30s and reflect on the nature of
*  again how these regimes came to power a classic book written in the aftermath of the second world
*  war but so many of the things which she was writing about the birth of anti-semitism for example
*  the drafus affair the role of race of how we can think about the petty bourgeoisie who was supporting
*  strongman rulers and how we can think about class and totalitarian movements all of those
*  i think are really giving us important insights into our contemporary regime and we're very
*  familiar with democratic backsliding everybody is talking about that we have a lot of description
*  about how it occurs and studies about for example how democracies die or how democracies are
*  backsliding but our theories i think have to think anew and have to think that new authoritarian
*  regimes are different to old authoritarian regimes and we need to get to grips and discard some of
*  our liberal assumptions and get some new evidence and new data to basically say is there genuine
*  popular appeals of authoritarianism we've measured support for democracy around the world in many
*  many surveys throughout the third wave era that's to say from the early mid 70s onwards
*  but what's the popular support not for a democracy with a big d but for an erosion of democratic
*  norms and practices and then real support for the values which authoritarian strongman leaders
*  promise do americans want stability do they want security do they want a restoration of the
*  america of the past and a sense of order versus crime and a sense that america can be quote great
*  again if they do is that also the secret to the support of many other strongman leaders around
*  the world and maybe we can look comparatively and we can really try to get to grips with why
*  backsliding is occurring and whether this is the heart of the challenges facing liberal democracy
