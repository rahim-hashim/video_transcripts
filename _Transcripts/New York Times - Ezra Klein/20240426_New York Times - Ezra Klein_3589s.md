# Salman Rushdie Is Not Who You Think He Is
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn8_-R319JM)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  I feel like I've always known who Solomon Rushdie is.
*  Long before I read literary fiction, he just sat in my consciousness as the author of
*  this eerie-sounding novel called The Satanic Verses, a novel so somehow dangerous he had
*  to go into hiding after the Supreme Leader of Iran said he and anyone involved in it
*  should be killed for blaspheming Islam.
*  So Rushdie sat there in the back of my mind for decades.
*  I didn't think much about him.
*  The whole story felt like this weird relic of the 80s.
*  But then in August of 2022, I saw the news that a fanatic with a knife had tried to carry
*  out the fadwa, had attacked Rushdie during a speech and nearly killed him.
*  There was confusion and panic.
*  The attack happened in full view of the audience, with Sir Salman left injured, lying on stage,
*  and eyewitnesses in deep shock.
*  They say Rushdie's attacker stabbed him 10 to 15 times before members of the audience
*  grabbed him and restrained him.
*  Rushdie is currently on a ventilator, unable to speak.
*  According to his book agent, the 75-year-old's liver was punctured.
*  He suffered severe nerve damage to his arm and will likely lose an eye.
*  Rushdie was attacked yesterday morning in front of roughly 25...
*  Rushdie survived, though he lost an eye to the attack, and the recovery and the rehabilitation
*  was grueling.
*  And he began to write again.
*  In his latest book, Knife is about the attack.
*  It's about his life.
*  It's about his marriage.
*  It's about his children.
*  And I think at its core, it's about something else too.
*  It's about the invention of other versions of him that became more real in the world
*  than he was.
*  Other versions of him that almost got him killed.
*  And this is what I now understand after reading Knife.
*  What I now understand after I went back and read for the first time the satanic verses.
*  I have never known who Salman Rushdie is.
*  And maybe not just him.
*  How many people out there do I wrongly think that I know?
*  As always, our email for guest suggestions and reflections, Ezra Klein Show at nytimes.com.
*  Salman Rushdie, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you.
*  Good to be with you.
*  I want to begin with a story you mentioned a little bit offhandedly in the book, which
*  is this story about the shadow by Hans Christian Andersen.
*  Yeah, the shadow, I think it's my favorite story of his.
*  It's about a man whose shadow gets detached from him and goes away.
*  For many years, he loses his shadow.
*  The shadow has traveled the world.
*  The shadow is quite sophisticated and cool.
*  And in some ways, it's more interesting than the man.
*  And the shadow returns.
*  And the man and the shadow spend some time together.
*  And then the man meets this princess who he's very taken by and interested in.
*  And the princess decides that she prefers the shadow to the man.
*  And actually, the shadow manages to persuade her that he's the real thing and the man is
*  the echo or the phony or the shadow.
*  And so in the end, the shadow manages to arrange for the man to be executed.
*  So the shadow takes over the life of the man.
*  So what does that story mean to you?
*  Why put it in this book?
*  It meant to me that a thing that happens more and more often, I think, is that a shadow
*  self can separate itself from the person and end up becoming in some way more real than
*  the original person.
*  People believe the shadow and don't believe the self.
*  So if I'd asked you in 1986, 1987, to describe how you understood yourself, what kind of
*  person you were, what kind of writer you were, what would your capsule sense of Salman Rushdie
*  have been?
*  In the 80s, it was actually a very good decade for me because it began in 1981 with the publication
*  and success of Midnight's Children, which was important to me for a number of reasons.
*  First of all, because it was my first literary success and there's kind of nothing quite
*  like first success.
*  Secondly, that it financially allowed me to begin to live as a writer rather than having
*  to work in advertising, which I'd been doing.
*  And it also deeply reconnected me to India, which I worried living in London that I was
*  kind of drifting away from those roots.
*  And the novel was a very conscious attempt to try and reclaim them.
*  And that was actually what made me happiest about the reception of the book was the way
*  in which it was received in India and the way in which it made me feel.
*  The 80s were a very happy time for me.
*  I was doing well.
*  If that's how you felt about you, who is the public you?
*  I mean, I had become identified as one of a kind of rising group of British based writers,
*  writers like Ian McEwen and Kazue Shiguro and Martin Amis and Angela Carter and Jeannette
*  Winterson.
*  And there's a bunch of us all roughly coming up at the same time.
*  And we got identified as this kind of special generation.
*  And so there was that.
*  I also had become perhaps a little bit more politically engaged than some of the others.
*  So I had written and done things on television about racism in England and post colonialism,
*  the remnants of the empire.
*  And so I was also associated with that kind of subject.
*  And then came the satanic verses and it changed everything.
*  When you began writing the satanic verses, what did you understand yourself to be doing?
*  What kind of book were you writing?
*  So I was writing these three stories.
*  One was about a character with name Jibreel, which is the Indian version of Gabriel, who
*  was a movie actor who's losing his mind and arrives rather dramatically as a result of
*  an airplane explosion in 1980s London.
*  At a time when the race relations situation was quite tense.
*  And this is the period of Margaret Thatcher's government.
*  And I guess what I thought I was doing was thinking about what happens to people when
*  they migrate from one culture to another and how much of their identity is brought into
*  question by doing that.
*  You know, they're suddenly they're in a language that isn't their first language and they're
*  in a community that doesn't know them.
*  And they very often are in a belief system, surrounded by a belief system or systems which
*  are different from their own.
*  And so they face all these challenges.
*  And I remember thinking, well, if that's what I think, then I should try and make the novel
*  itself that kind of challenge.
*  And so the question of religious belief and so on becomes one of the subjects of the book.
*  I remember when I was reading the book, I saw Jibril having these dreams about the birth
*  of a religion.
*  And I thought I'd made sufficient distance because in the novel and in his dreams, the
*  religion is not called Islam and the prophet is not called Muhammad and the city is not
*  called Mecca.
*  And all this is happening in the dreams of somebody who's losing his mind.
*  I thought, you know, this is what we call fiction.
*  Yeah, some people took it the wrong way.
*  What is it literally in the book?
*  What is the actual story you tell in the book?
*  It causes this offense.
*  Well, of course, the people who attacked the book had not read it.
*  So there's that.
*  But there is a well-known story that is in many of the traditions of Islam.
*  To put it simply, there were three very successful popular winged goddesses in Mecca at the time,
*  whose temples were at the gates of the city.
*  It's a big trading city, so people would come and go through the gates and they would make
*  offerings at these temples or put it another way, pay taxes.
*  So the families that ran these temples were very wealthy and powerful in the city.
*  And so the theory is that the prophet was offered a deal.
*  And the story goes that he comes down from the mountain and recites some verses which
*  accept the status of these goddesses, the level of the angels.
*  And then we don't know what happens, but it seems as if there was a lot of opposition
*  to his statement from amongst the new faithful.
*  And then after a short period of time that's unclear, he rejects those verses and he says
*  that the devil spoke to him in the guise of the angel and that these were satanic verses,
*  which should be expunged from the Quran, which they were, and replaced by other verses
*  in which he discounts these goddesses.
*  So that's the episode about a possible temptation and then the rejection of the temptation.
*  And I thought, you know, that exists in many religious traditions.
*  And actually he comes out of it quite well.
*  So I mean, I came across this story when I was at university, when I was at Cambridge,
*  and one of the things I was studying was early Islamic history.
*  And I came across this story and I remember thinking, you know, good story.
*  And that was 1968.
*  And I guess 20 years later I find out how good a story it was.
*  When the book comes out, I was going back to try to understand the timeline here.
*  The fatwa against you, I hadn't understood this, anybody involved in the publication
*  of the book, that doesn't happen for five months or so.
*  Five or six months, yeah.
*  So what is the initial reaction to the book?
*  When people first get their hands on it, what do the reviewers say?
*  How do you understand?
*  Because there's always a difference.
*  How do you understand that people have understood the book?
*  Well, the reviews were good, but not sensational.
*  There was one review I remember, which in retrospect seems amusing, where the reviewer
*  said, what's all this stuff about Muslims doing in a novel about London?
*  I guess now they know.
*  That one doesn't age well.
*  No, but you know, it was nominated for the Booker Prize.
*  So it did pretty well.
*  And actually, I'm told that the one or two English language bookstores in Iran were happily
*  stocking it without any problem.
*  And then came the moment of the fatwa and then things got much nastier.
*  Khomeini called for the death of British writer Salman Rushdie.
*  We want Rushdie to be hanged, do you see?
*  My first man, Rushdie, and kill him, you know.
*  I want him lost!
*  Rushdie, who comes from a Muslim family himself, went into hiding, moving to another
*  location every time Scotland Yard's special branch thinks it prudent that he do so.
*  To the best of your understanding now, why does the fatwa happen?
*  Well, there's a political reason why it happens, which is that chronologically, the moment
*  in Iran at which it happened was very soon after the end of the Iran-Iraq War, in which
*  essentially a whole generation of young Iranian people had died for no gain.
*  And the revolution was probably more unpopular and in greater danger at that moment than
*  at any other moment.
*  And I think, frankly, Khomeini was looking for a way of rallying the troops.
*  And unfortunately, I became it.
*  And there's also, in my reading, some amount of competition at that time between, as there
*  between Saudi Arabia and Iran on who will be the leader of the worldwide Muslims.
*  For sure.
*  And they competed over their opposition to my book as well.
*  Certainly, initially, in the UK anyway, a lot of the demonstrations that began to happen
*  around the book were funded out of Saudi Arabia, as far as I'm told.
*  And then the Iranian fatwa came and hijacked it.
*  So they kind of piggybacked on what initially had been the Saudi-led protest and took it
*  over.
*  During the course of the nine years or so of the police protection, I was told maybe
*  six times that there were serious assassination attempts underway, that people had entered
*  the country with an intention of carrying out the threat.
*  Other people involved with the book in other countries were attacked and killed, which
*  is something I did not know.
*  Yeah, I mean, the worst thing was the Japanese translator of the book, who was a college
*  professor who was actually a specialist in Islamic history and art, and who translated
*  the book into Japanese, was murdered one night near his office on campus in Japan.
*  And my Italian translator was attacked at his residence, and fortunately survived.
*  And my Norwegian publisher was shot several times in the back while getting up in the
*  morning to go to work.
*  And he also kind of miraculously survived.
*  I felt horrible, you know, because they felt like these were proxy attacks, you know, that
*  they really wanted me, they couldn't get at me, so they got at them.
*  And I remember calling William Nygard, who was my Norwegian publisher, to apologize to
*  him.
*  And he said, Salman, don't apologize, I'm a grown up.
*  I knew that I wanted to publish the Satanic Verses, and I'm very happy that I did.
*  And then in a kind of wonderfully publishing way, he said, guess what, I've just ordered
*  a very large reprint.
*  I guess in publishing, that is the best revenge.
*  I mean, there's occasions where I felt myself in the company of really brave people.
*  And I think if you've just been shot three times in the back, and your reaction to that
*  is to order a reprint, that's courage.
*  So I had not read the Satanic Verses until preparing for the show with you.
*  And I think if you had never told me anything about it, I would never have assumed there
*  had been any reaction to it at all.
*  It reminded me as a book, more than anything else, as I read it, of White Teeth by Zadie
*  Smith, which I think the cause of all that goes the other way.
*  Yes, I mean, she said you're an influence on her.
*  So I just understood that because I read it first.
*  It's a very fun, stuffed, manic, exciting, imaginative novel, but it's nothing like what
*  I had believed.
*  No, it's true that the novel that was invented for public obloquy doesn't actually exist.
*  And I've had it happen to me, I can't even tell you how many times, that people who,
*  like you, have finally got around to reading the book have said to me, well, where's the
*  problem?
*  Where's the dirty bit, if you like?
*  They don't see that it's there.
*  The other thing people say to me is who knew it was funny?
*  Well, that was actually my first reaction.
*  I didn't expect the tone of the book at all.
*  It wasn't the tone I assumed of the book.
*  It wasn't the tone I assumed of you.
*  It's very funny.
*  It's very alive.
*  You know, before the Satanic Verses, the books I wrote before that, people thought they were
*  funny.
*  People would write about me as a funny writer.
*  That was often mentioned in what was said about me.
*  And after the Satanic Verses, for a long time, nobody wrote about me as a funny writer.
*  It was as if, because the thing that had happened to me was not funny, that was kind of dark
*  and obscurely theological, it was assumed that I must be dark and obscurely theological.
*  It was as if the characteristics of the attack were transposed onto the person being attacked.
*  So I became the personification of the characteristics of the attack.
*  And that other me who was funny and antique and interested in mythology and fantasy and
*  politics and history, that person vanished.
*  In a way, the biggest damage that the attack on the Satanic Verses did to me was not physical
*  danger.
*  It was a damage to people's thinking about my writing.
*  And a lot of people, I think, who might have enjoyed the book, and might have enjoyed my
*  books in general, have been put off by the kind of shadow of the Islamist attack.
*  But it was almost universally true that the people who attacked it did not read it.
*  I mean, I remember seeing a television interview when I was still living in England with one
*  of the leaders of the Indian Muslim protest against the book.
*  And the television reporters asked him if he'd read it.
*  And he said this kind of rather wonderful thing.
*  He said, no, he said, I don't need to walk in the gutter to know that it contains filth.
*  So that was the kind of attitude.
*  You don't need to read it.
*  It's just bad.
*  And so in that way, the book, no less than the person can have a shadow.
*  It was really upsetting to me, which is why in those early days, you know, there were
*  a lot of people who were defending me, my right not to be murdered, and so on.
*  But I kept saying to them, could you please defend the text, defend the book?
*  And not that many people did that.
*  In fact, there was a kind of gag going around in those days that the book was impossible
*  to read, unreadable, which was a way of excusing yourself from reading it.
*  So we talked a bit about who you were understood as publicly before the book, right?
*  The sort of public salmon was.
*  And as I understood you describe it, you're a kind of post-colonial writer to the extent
*  you're a man of politics, a man roughly of the left, critical of Thatcher.
*  Who emerges now?
*  Well, what happens is that entire self that had been how I was seen and how I thought
*  of myself for a decade was just erased overnight.
*  As if it didn't exist.
*  And what was created instead was this irresponsible, selfish, arrogant, bad writer and bad person
*  who had deliberately set out to offend the great world religion and only just about deserved
*  to be protected from harm.
*  Only just about.
*  So I ask this because there's a dynamic I want to trace here about the way when there
*  is a chasm between the self and the public shadow, the book and its public shadow, that
*  people feel a need to harmonize the two, not side with one or the other, but assume that
*  there must be some logic that connects the two.
*  So talk through that reaction of the West, the kind of people who wanted to harmonize.
*  It was very shocking.
*  I mean, first of all, I had been quite a vocal critic of the Margaret Thatcher government.
*  And then that was the government that had to offer me protection.
*  So on the one hand, there were accusations of hypocrisy.
*  Oh, you're happy knocking the government until they have to save your skin and then
*  you take the protection and save your sorry ass.
*  There's some of that.
*  There was just some of just straightforward political opposition.
*  There were people whose politics were not like mine, actually members of the government
*  cabinet who said rude things about the book.
*  And then there was a very upsetting kind of literary strain to the hostility.
*  Writers I wouldn't expect, John Berger, Germaine Greer, John Le Carre, one of that group said
*  nobody can insult a great world religion with impunity.
*  As if to say if you do that, then you don't deserve to be safe.
*  But I remember being very surprised to find Jimmy Carter on the side of the detractors.
*  That was almost more shocking to me than the Islamic attack because I thought, you know,
*  the Iranian regime is a tyrannical authoritarian regime.
*  And if it behaves in a tyrannical authoritarian way, it's not entirely surprising.
*  But to have Western artists and intellectuals doing that was very, very upsetting.
*  And in India too.
*  In India too.
*  When my ethnic origin is that my family was originally Kashmiri in the north of India.
*  Oh, Pakistanis would say not so much the north of India.
*  But we were Kashmiri family.
*  And I've written a lot about Kashmir.
*  I wrote about it in Midnight's Children.
*  I wrote about it in Shalamar the Clown.
*  I now know because a kind of jihadist mindset has increased in Kashmir that if I were to
*  go there, I might not be safe.
*  And that feels horrible.
*  The place from which my family comes is a place to which I can't safely go.
*  Both my parents are buried in Karachi, Pakistan.
*  And there's no way I can ever go and visit their grave.
*  This kind of thing is just deeply troubling to me.
*  I mean, obviously you do not like the version of yourself that was created that was worthy
*  of being murdered or worthy of at least the overreaction of being murdered.
*  What was your relationship?
*  What is your relationship to the more sainted public version of yourself, the symbol?
*  I mean, you know, I mean, thank you very much.
*  It's nice for people to be nice about you.
*  But I've never felt symbolic.
*  The statue in the harbour, that's a symbol.
*  I feel like a working artist and I would like to be known and judged by the work that I make.
*  Having said that, I was involved in the free speech issue before anything happened to me.
*  I mean, I was working with the British branch of Penn trying to defend various writers in
*  trouble in various parts of the world.
*  I was doing my bit for that effort.
*  And then a lot of writers' organisations really came out to bat for me, you know,
*  really stood up for me.
*  And I was very grateful for that.
*  And so that became a part of how I saw myself.
*  I have to say a secondary part, because I still think the person who sits alone in the
*  room and makes things up is who I really am.
*  Tell me a bit about that dynamic, because you kept writing.
*  Yeah.
*  How did your writing change under this pressure?
*  Well, I tried to not let it change.
*  I remember thinking very consciously quite early after the fatwa and all that.
*  Of course, there was physical danger.
*  But there was also artistic danger.
*  There were ways in which this attack could destroy me as an artist.
*  It could frighten me.
*  And so then I would not write anything risky.
*  I would write safe little frightened books.
*  Or it would fill me so much with anger and a desire for revenge that I would write
*  revenge books.
*  And I told myself that both of those would be the destruction of my artistic independence
*  and whatever quality I have as a writer, it would destroy.
*  I think probably one of the greatest acts of will that I've ever performed in my life
*  was to try and not let my writing be knocked off track by the attack on the Satanic verses.
*  You moved to New York what year?
*  2000.
*  And that then becomes another shadow self that you talk about some in the book, where
*  you develop after moving to New York a reputation as a, I think you call it,
*  Salman the party animal.
*  A party boy, yeah.
*  And I'm truly not.
*  Would you own it if you were?
*  No, I actually don't really like big parties.
*  I'm sociable.
*  That's true.
*  And I am quite sociable.
*  But I like to see my friends one at a time or two or three at a time so we can actually
*  talk to each other.
*  But what happened was when I started living in New York is I realized that it wasn't so
*  much a question of me being frightened.
*  There's people being frightened of me.
*  People being scared to be around me because of the threat of danger hovering like a dark
*  angel over my head.
*  And I thought the only way I can get rid of that is to behave in a way that is not scared.
*  If people can see that I'm not being scared, then maybe they'll stop being scared.
*  And so I deliberately embarked on a policy of public visibility, going to places where
*  I knew I'd be photographed and where, you know, the New York Post would write about me.
*  And it worked because after quite a short period of time, people thought, oh, yeah,
*  he's just here and he's around and about and it's fine.
*  And that was what I wanted to achieve.
*  And then it kind of went too far.
*  And I turned into this butterfly, this social butterfly, which in my view, I'm not really.
*  But so that's interesting to me, the way you had to act in relationship again to these public
*  selves, right?
*  Now you're the one who has to reconcile through your own behavior.
*  You have to change who you are to try to change how people think you are and what comfort they
*  have around you.
*  I'm going to try something a little tricky here.
*  And I don't in any way want to trivialize the violence, the terror that you've lived through.
*  I was struck with the thought that you have for decades now lived in the most extreme
*  possible version of what seems to me to be a very modern condition in which little scraps
*  of yourself, scraps of things you've written or echoes of interpretations of things you've
*  written ricochet around an internet or a world and create this kind of
*  or a world and create this other version of you that people begin to believe in.
*  And I think this happens again in a very small and much less terrorizing way to people all
*  the time on TikTok, on Facebook, on X.
*  They say something or they said things or they've been a person and soon a version of
*  them emerges that is more real to other people than they are.
*  Do you think this is a more common thing?
*  Well, I certainly agree entirely with how you describe the creation of false selves
*  by this new weapon of social media.
*  I've often thought that if these things had existed in 1989, I would have been in far
*  more danger because the speed with which material can be transmitted is so much greater.
*  The way in which groupthink can be created and mobs can be created would have enormously
*  escalated the danger.
*  At that time, the most sophisticated method of transmission was the fax machine.
*  And that kept the lid on it to some degree until Khomeini blew the lid off.
*  I know that there are two or three graphics containing absolutely false quotes from me,
*  things I've never even come close to saying, which keep cropping up.
*  People keep retweeting them and repeating them.
*  And even though I have once or twice said, look, this is nonsense, I've never said this,
*  that doesn't stop it.
*  It just keeps going.
*  So there are quotes ascribed to me, views ascribed to me, which I don't hold, which
*  are actually antithetical to things that I think, but they're out there.
*  I mean, I think to some degree, it's always been the case, because I've been
*  before social media, that there's a disconnect between the private self of the writer and
*  the way in which they're publicly perceived.
*  I mean, I've wrote a little bit about this.
*  I said various writers, Gunter Grass, Jorge Luis Borges, Graham Greene, they all had this
*  sense of there being a public self, which wasn't quite them, but which was how they
*  were seen.
*  And I had a kind of magnified version of that, I think.
*  And social media certainly helps to magnify it.
*  I mean, I think on some level that has always been true for everybody, right?
*  There is the person we are, although I'm not somebody who believes that is a very stable
*  concept.
*  No, that's an unstable concept.
*  And then the way we are seen by our families, by our friends, by our lovers, by our antagonists,
*  by our colleagues, whoever.
*  The thing that feels different, something extraordinary typically had to happen for
*  the distance between your private self and your public self to matter at any significant
*  scale.
*  Yeah.
*  But what strikes me is that the experience at a modest level has been democratized.
*  Yes.
*  The number of people who are not famous, who are not a well-known writer, who do not have
*  demonstrations in the street against them, who can nevertheless become the main character
*  on social media, who can see a version of them just ricochet through local high schools
*  as people post something about them on Facebook or on Instagram and everybody else is commenting.
*  I mean, kids commit suicide around this all the time now.
*  It does feel to me like a difficulty of being just alive now.
*  I mean, when these things arrived, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, I thought this is very
*  interesting.
*  And it's a new way of talking to each other.
*  And certainly if you're a writer, it's a way of talking to your readers without any
*  intermediary.
*  And that's enjoyable.
*  And for a moment, I participated in this and was quite enjoying it.
*  I think maybe it changed and the world changed in the way that you're describing.
*  But I suddenly began to think this is a room containing people that I don't want to be in
*  the room with.
*  And so I backed away from it very dramatically.
*  One of the things I was thinking about reading a book is I know people who have gone through
*  public scandal, who didn't deserve it, who hadn't done the thing or there really was
*  no thing.
*  One thing I've noticed is many of them go through a period, sometimes don't even get
*  out of the period of believing they must somehow deserve it.
*  They do the reconciliation in their own head that even if they didn't do the thing that
*  they're being denounced for or it's not even clear what they're being denounced for,
*  they almost have to believe they did something deserving of it for their reality to make sense
*  to them.
*  They begin.
*  They do the violence to themselves of believing the shadow self, right?
*  More than they still believe in themselves.
*  Did that happen to you?
*  Yeah, I did right at the beginning.
*  I began to believe that two things that first of all, there was a kind of category mistake
*  about the satanic verses, which was being treated as a work of polemical fact, whereas
*  actually as a work of imagination and fiction.
*  If I can just explain that this is not fact, this is fiction, that people would say, oh,
*  yeah, we get it now.
*  And that was kind of foolish, but I thought it.
*  And then I thought if I can just explain in interviews and essays and so on, who I am
*  and what I thought I was doing and why I believe it to be completely legitimate, that people
*  would again go, oh gosh, we made a terrible mistake.
*  Yeah, he's a nice guy after all.
*  Let's stop.
*  And then there was a period, I mean, about a year or year and a half into the story when
*  I was very, very depressed, I was in really quite deep depression about everything and
*  didn't see how it would ever end.
*  And I thought maybe what I have to do is to reach out to the Muslim community and try
*  and apologize.
*  You know, and I did.
*  And it rebounded very hard in my face.
*  And actually my sister, who I love and is closer to me than anybody else in the world,
*  is one year younger than me.
*  She describes herself, my much younger sister called me when she heard me making these
*  apologias, you know, she said, what the hell are you doing?
*  Have you lost your mind?
*  And I thought, you know, yes, I have.
*  Yes, I have.
*  I'm behaving in a deranged way.
*  And that felt to me like hitting rock bottom.
*  I hate that this is true about culture right now.
*  I don't know that I've ever seen it be the case or at least very rarely seem to be the case
*  that apologizing whether the person did something or did not do something
*  helps because what apologizing seems to me to do now is it gives people the license
*  to believe that it was all justified in the first place.
*  Like if you're if it's you submitting to the reality, that's why in a way I think there's a
*  crazed power to people like Donald Trump who exist in a world without, I think, personal shame.
*  Because they don't apologize, they're able to keep the instability of the different realities
*  coherent.
*  I never lost the election.
*  I never did anything wrong.
*  I never did any of it.
*  So there never needs to be a moment where the people who are on their side have to reconcile
*  the sort of admission of wrongdoing.
*  Whereas the people who try to come out and be decent people about and say,
*  I did do something terribly wrong here suffer.
*  No, shamelessness is the great public weapon of our time.
*  Yes.
*  If you really have it, and yes, of course he does in spades,
*  you can do what he's done, which is to spend a lifetime getting away with it.
*  I mean, not just since he's been in politics, but way before then, I mean,
*  getting away with it is his great skill.
*  And the tool that he uses is absolute lack of shame.
*  And I mean, I would put in a miniature way, the ex British Prime Minister Boris Johnson
*  in the same bag, absolute total liar in everything he says and does,
*  and totally shameless about it and gets away with it until he didn't.
*  I mean, I do think this, we live in this age, right, where you have a global community,
*  an algorithmic global community, and communities discipline in the first instance
*  through the application of shame, through shaming each other and eliciting shame in each other.
*  And that's a supercharged dynamic in modern life.
*  And so if you happen to be immune to it, right,
*  if you happen in ways that are, I would suspect, usually quite personally destructive,
*  to be immune to it is often a very important disciplining emotion.
*  Yes, it's a superpower.
*  It becomes, as you put it, a superpower.
*  Yeah. And I find myself withdrawing from this modern world as much as I can.
*  This is maybe a function of being almost 77 years old, but I really go less and less
*  towards social media.
*  I barely use it now.
*  And every time I go there, I kind of wish I hadn't.
*  So I think maybe I'll just, whatever years are left to me,
*  manage to do it without being a part of the modern world.
*  So let's go quite a bit forward in time.
*  It's 2022.
*  It's before the Chautauqua event where the attack happens.
*  At this point, who are you to you and who do you think you are at that point to the public?
*  So I genuinely thought that the real question was,
*  who are you to you and who do you think you are to the public?
*  I think that's a very important question.
*  I think that's a very important question.
*  At that point to the public.
*  So I genuinely thought that the risk was in the past.
*  And I had 22 years of evidence for that.
*  So it wasn't unreasonable to believe that.
*  At this point, I had more or less completely regained,
*  let's say, the life of a writer, where I was doing everything that writers get asked to do.
*  I was doing book tours and literary festivals and lectures and readings and all of that,
*  especially after near sequestration.
*  It was very pleasant to be back in the world.
*  I mean, it used to be that some airlines were scared to carry me.
*  And people in restaurants would look uneasy if I walked in the room.
*  And I was going to Yankee Stadium and concerts at the garden and just leading an ordinary life.
*  I felt very okay doing it.
*  It used to be the case that every time I published a book,
*  the writing about it would begin by restating the stuff that happened around the satanic verses.
*  And the new book would be judged in the shadow of that event.
*  And that kind of stopped happening.
*  As I went on writing and publishing more books of very different kinds,
*  people began to respond to my work just as work, not as the latest creation of this dark individual.
*  So where are you on August 12th?
*  There. I had just finished...
*  But I mean physically, where are you?
*  Physically, oh, I was in New York City.
*  And then on August the 11th, I had flown up to do an event at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua,
*  New York, in Western New York.
*  Which is deeply ironically an event for asylum for writers.
*  Yeah. What had happened was that my friend Henry Reese had for many years, like 20 years,
*  been running a kind of asylum program in Pittsburgh.
*  He had a whole little street of houses which he made available to writers from various countries
*  who needed a safe place.
*  And they, Chautauqua had invited Henry to come and talk about that.
*  To come and talk about that.
*  And he asked me if I would come and have the conversation with him.
*  So I'd actually gone there to talk about him and his project and the success of his project.
*  And then, yeah, it turned out that I was the one who needed protection.
*  What happened?
*  Well, we had just come out on stage.
*  And I mean the Chautauqua Amphitheatre is a very large space.
*  So it actually, when it's full, it I believe can seat like 4,000 people.
*  And there were probably something like 1,500 people there.
*  In the morning, 1030, 1045 in the morning.
*  Very beautiful, sunny day in August.
*  And Henry and I came out and were introduced by someone from the institution.
*  We were sitting in chairs on the stage.
*  And almost the moment the introduction was over,
*  we really had no time to start our conversation.
*  Because I saw this man approaching rapidly from my right.
*  And to my right, there was a small flight of stairs, like four or five stairs.
*  And he came sprinting up the steps and attacked me.
*  When you are writing through this in the book, you talk a bit about freezing.
*  And you have a line that I've been thinking about since I read it where you write,
*  this is as close to understanding my inaction as I've been able to get.
*  The targets of violence experience a crisis in their understanding of the real.
*  What do you mean?
*  Well, I mean that we all live in a picture of the real.
*  We all have a kind of sense of how things are.
*  And that sense of how things are is our reality.
*  And then when something calamitous happens,
*  somebody arrives in a school with an assault rifle.
*  Somebody arrives in a church with a gun or in a shopping mall.
*  Everybody in those locations has a picture of what they're doing.
*  If you're in a church, you're there for reasons of belief and worship.
*  If you're in a shopping mall, you're there to shop.
*  If you're in a school, you're there to be at school.
*  And that's how you see the world.
*  And the explosion of violence into that picture destroys that reality.
*  And then you literally don't know the shape of the world.
*  And very often I think people are paralyzed and don't know what to do.
*  How do you act in a moment when the thing that's happened
*  isn't a part of the narrative you think you're in?
*  And that's what happened to me.
*  I thought I was froze.
*  The attack was a knife attack.
*  And you write that a gunshot is action at a distance,
*  but a knife attack is a kind of intimacy.
*  What's intimate about it?
*  Well, it's right up against you.
*  This guy was, there wasn't even an inch of space between him and me.
*  And he's not shooting from a distance.
*  He's not shooting an arrow.
*  He's right up in my face, sticking a knife in me.
*  And then of course I fell down and he was on top of me.
*  So that's about as intimate as you can get to be
*  underneath somebody who's on top of you.
*  I mean, there are other occasions when that happens and those are more pleasurable.
*  I realized when I read you write this, I thought about the intimacy of it for you.
*  And it's only hearing you say it that I think about the intimacy for him.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  I'm not saying I can imagine standing 50 feet away from somebody and shooting them,
*  but the idea of charging them.
*  Yeah.
*  And sticking a knife jumping on them, sticking a knife in their neck and their eyes slashing at them.
*  I don't know what state of mind you have to be in to make it possible to do that.
*  You're trained your entire life socially.
*  I mean, I feel weird asking somebody for the time.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just too close up.
*  It's too close up.
*  Some of the book is about trying to understand him.
*  What do you know about the attacker?
*  Like how did he end up there and how did he end up there with the level of hatred or determination?
*  Well, I know very little.
*  I mean, there have been just a couple of newspaper reports on which I base my knowledge of him.
*  There was one interview that he gave from prison to the New York Post
*  in which he said a little bit about his life.
*  And then there was a second interview, I forget in which journal that his mother gave
*  about her react, horrified reaction to what had happened.
*  And what seems to be the story as far as I can piece it together
*  is that his parents were of Lebanese origin.
*  They moved to the United States and he was born and raised in Jersey.
*  His parents separated.
*  His father went back to Lebanon.
*  His mother stayed in New Jersey with himself and his sisters.
*  And until he was approximately, I don't know exactly, but approximately 19-ish years old,
*  that's all he was.
*  He was a kid growing up in Jersey and had no criminal record.
*  And then at about that time, he chooses to go to Lebanon to visit his father.
*  And according to his mother, when he first got there, his father lives in a village
*  which is very near the Israeli border and is a very strongly Hezbollah village
*  with billboards of Hezbollah heroes around the streets.
*  His mother says that when he first got there, he really didn't like it.
*  He wanted to come home right away.
*  But he stayed only for about a month.
*  And he came back a month later and according to his mother,
*  had completely transformed as a different person
*  and was now angry with her for not having taught him properly about religion.
*  His mother's house in Fairview has a basement and he went and sequestered himself in the basement,
*  lived separately from everyone else, playing video games and watching YouTube videos.
*  Essentially, he lived a kind of, as far as I can see, a pretty solitary kind of loner's life
*  for something like four years between his visit to Lebanon
*  and his decision to attack me.
*  And somehow in that period of time, he becomes the kind of person who can commit murder.
*  And then at a certain point, he sees something on Twitter from the Chautauqua Institution,
*  announcing their program of events.
*  And he saw that I was listed on the amongst the program of events
*  and then decided to make his plan.
*  Wait, he sees an advertisement from the Small Literary Foundation?
*  Yeah.
*  And on that your life turns?
*  Yes.
*  The efficacy of Twitter advertising?
*  This appears to be the case.
*  The idea that he could become someone who could murder
*  seems in some ways less improbable than that you could end up as his target.
*  This is somebody born after the satanic verses, if I'm not wrong.
*  And you're just not there anymore.
*  There's a lot that has happened, the war on terrorism, the invasion of Iraq, right?
*  So much has happened.
*  The subject has changed.
*  The subject has changed.
*  How does he end up focusing on you?
*  How does he end up even knowing who you are?
*  This is what I don't know.
*  There's an absence in my understanding of him.
*  I mean, I can guess that while he was with his father in this very Hezbollah dominated village,
*  that somebody might have mentioned my name as a bad guy, anti-Muslim.
*  And it may be that that was triggered by his seeing something on social media
*  about my upcoming talk.
*  But I don't really know.
*  I mean, actually, I remember saying to my editor at Random House
*  that if I was to write a story in which somebody by his own admission
*  had read only two pages of somebody's writing and seen a couple of YouTube videos
*  and then were to decide to murder that person,
*  my editor would say to me, that's not convincing.
*  It's not enough motivation.
*  Yeah.
*  You say in the book that your attempted murder seemed under motivated,
*  which is one of the funnier, I mean, darkly funny lines I've read in a while.
*  You know, I was thinking about Iago Othello, that the only thing that happens to Iago
*  is that he's passed over for a promotion.
*  That's it.
*  That's his beef.
*  And because of that, he decides to destroy the lives of two people,
*  Othello and Desdemona, for no reason, just bad.
*  And I often wondered about is there such a thing?
*  Is there such a thing as a person like that who is simply evil, just a bad guy,
*  doesn't need much of a motive?
*  And the reason that doesn't quite work in this case is because such scraps of information
*  as we have about him prior to his visit to Lebanon, although he was a perfectly nice person,
*  no problem, well liked, then the transformation is what's interesting.
*  But there's a way in which, in addition to him being a bit of a safer to you,
*  he's trying to kill some other version of you.
*  The thing that struck me so much about it, he doesn't actually know anything about you.
*  He didn't really case the target.
*  No, he didn't do any research.
*  He seemed very, you know, very uninterested.
*  It's very casual.
*  Very uninterested in knowing who it was that he decided to murder.
*  Just because, I guess, he'd heard from people he was influenced by that I was some kind of demonic figure.
*  There is a very effective degree of demonization that has taken place across the Islamic world.
*  In which there's a lot of people who grow up thinking that I'm the kind of boogeyman.
*  On the other hand, his own family were not like that.
*  They were not fanatics.
*  They were perfectly secularized American citizens.
*  So I don't know where he got it from.
*  You decide not to go to try to interview your attacker.
*  I think the core of the book, and in some ways the apogee of the book,
*  is this imagined dialogue between the two of you.
*  And one thing you say to him in this imagined dialogue is,
*  I know that it is possible to construct an image of a man,
*  a second self that bears very little resemblance to the first self.
*  But the second self gains credibility because it is repeated over and over again
*  until it begins to feel real, more real than the first self.
*  And you imagine saying this to him.
*  And you imagine saying this to him,
*  almost as a way of helping him understand what he was doing.
*  You are creating his shadow self.
*  Right?
*  You are creating a version of him that is now more real in the world than he is.
*  I hope so.
*  Tell me about that.
*  Well, I included this anecdote about Samuel Beckett being the victim of a knife attack.
*  And he almost died.
*  And in his case, he actually did go to confront his attacker in court.
*  And said to him, why do you do it?
*  And all the man was able to say was, I don't know, sir, I'm sorry.
*  And I thought, that's useless.
*  That doesn't get you anywhere.
*  And I thought, even if I was permitted by his lawyer or whatever to have a meeting,
*  I would get some banality.
*  I probably wouldn't get an apology because there's no indication of any remorse.
*  But I would get some form of ideologues, sloganized answer,
*  which wouldn't get me anywhere.
*  It wouldn't answer for me this hole in my understanding of him.
*  But how can somebody with so little knowledge of a person agree to murder them?
*  So I thought, maybe the best way to do this is to use my skill,
*  my skill of imagination and storytelling to try and get inside his head.
*  And at least create a character that I can believe might do something like this,
*  whether it's his real character or not actually become secondary.
*  I want the fictional character.
*  I mean, I understand that as a storyteller, there's now a whole,
*  the center of your story, right?
*  A character who no longer made sense to you, even as he had become a central character.
*  Was it therapeutic to make, I don't want to say him correctly motivated,
*  but fleshed out enough that the story works?
*  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't use the word therapeutic,
*  but it was a way of taking control of the narrative.
*  It was where I was saying this is my narrative.
*  I tell the story.
*  I read the book and we haven't spoken in detail about the rest of it,
*  but the rest of it, I understood it as a very deep,
*  intense assertion of the reality of your actual self.
*  I mean, the book is physical and intimate and in your rehabilitation
*  and in your hospital stay and in the things that had to happen for you to stand again
*  and walk again in the moments you almost died, in the moments that medication turned on you
*  and created terrible and often somewhat grotesque physical maladies.
*  And there was a way in which you couldn't read the book
*  without this deep confrontation with your life as you actually lived it.
*  I mean, the book felt to me like a deep insistence
*  that the Salman Rushdie who mattered was the one who actually lived through all this.
*  Well, I hope that people read it that way.
*  So thank you because for one thing, I rarely in my life felt so deeply physically connected
*  to my body as I have in this last year and a half.
*  It was such an incredibly physical thing that happened,
*  both the attack and the recovery and the psychological ramifications of all of that.
*  I thought I have to get into this.
*  I can't actually present the story in a way that makes sense to people
*  unless I reveal undress in public.
*  And it felt a bit, I always think publishing a book is a little bit like undressing in public,
*  but this one really is.
*  The memoir form was more or less invented by Rousseau in his Confessions.
*  And ever since then, I've always thought the principle of the autobiographical memoir
*  is tell as much truth as possible.
*  If you're not going to tell the whole naked, unvarnished truth, don't write the book.
*  There are the parts of the book that are literally like that, where you are undressed,
*  you're being operated on, you're in a surgical room.
*  And then there are the parts that actually felt more like that to me
*  because they were so intensely vulnerable.
*  And there's a dimension of the book and you come back to it a few times
*  where you somewhat insist on your own life as a tragedy.
*  You somewhat admit a kind of defeat.
*  And I want to talk about that.
*  And I want to see, rather than having me read this, I wanted to have you read it.
*  It's from Naif.
*  The most upsetting thing about the attack is that it has turned me once again into
*  somebody I have tried very hard not to be.
*  For more than 30 years, I have refused to be defined by the fatwa and insisted on being seen
*  as the author of my books.
*  Five before the fatwa and 16 after it.
*  I had just about managed it.
*  When the last few books were published,
*  people finally stopped asking me about the attack on the satanic verses and its author.
*  And now here I am, dragged back into that unwanted subject.
*  I think now I'll never be able to escape it.
*  No matter what I've already written or may now write,
*  I'll always be the guy who got knifed.
*  The knife defines me.
*  I'll fight a battle against that, but I suspect I will lose.
*  Yeah, I was in a bad mood when I wrote that.
*  Yeah, I was going to ask if you still feel that way.
*  Up to a point I do, yes, because it took me so long to shake off the shadow of the fatwa
*  itself in those years and to have people begin to respond to my books just as books,
*  whether they like them or not, it doesn't matter.
*  But that shadow wasn't hanging over people's response to my work.
*  And now here it is again.
*  And truly I don't know if whatever I write next will be read in the light of this attack,
*  or whether people will be able to read and judge and enjoy it on its own terms.
*  This book, even that paragraph, struck me as a different answer to the question than I think
*  you've sort of admitted to giving.
*  You've written a sort of autobiography before, a memoir called Just of Anton,
*  which you did in the third person.
*  This book is in the first person.
*  And it doesn't really seem to me this book is about being the writer of books.
*  Its book is about being a person, right?
*  Like a person in a physical body who could die, who has a wife he loves, who has children.
*  It just forced an understanding of you as a person.
*  Yeah, it's a very bad reason for having to write a self-portrait.
*  But it is intended as a self-portrait, with, as I say, as much openness and undefendedness
*  as I could manage.
*  Did trying to write the self-portrait, did it change your sense of yourself?
*  Yeah, that's a good question.
*  No, I think it just in some way clarified it.
*  You know, one of the questions I ask myself in the book is given that you've been,
*  by great good fortune and medical skill, given a second act that you weren't supposed to have,
*  how are you going to use it?
*  What will you do with that gift of time?
*  And the reason why so much of the book is about love and family
*  is because that's what's right at the front of my head now.
*  You know, in whatever time I have left, I mean, I hope it'll be a while.
*  That's what I want to focus on, that and work, and frankly, nothing else.
*  I mean, I think, you know, look, this is the 22nd book.
*  If there aren't any more books, that's okay.
*  There's a lot already.
*  Probably nobody will ever read all 22.
*  So there's enough of me out there on the shelves.
*  I mean, I hope there are some more, but it's, but the priority now is
*  to lead a life of loving and being loved.
*  That's what I think this thing has taught me.
*  I think that's a nice place to end.
*  So then always our final question.
*  What are three books you would recommend to the audience?
*  So I would recommend Don Quixote for many people,
*  the first great masterpiece in the novel form, and for many people, the greatest,
*  especially also because there's now a wonderful new translation of it by Edith Grossman,
*  which makes it very accessible to English readers.
*  Previous translations were frankly a little dull,
*  but this one is fantastically vivid and alive.
*  So that, yeah, I mean, I will have to say, because I think it's the greatest novel of the last,
*  however long, 100 years of solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
*  And please read the book rather than watch the Netflix version.
*  And it's a great shame that his heirs have overruled that.
*  But 100 years of solitude is one of the most joyful books ever written.
*  From the first sentence, you are plunged into this world of magic.
*  And what would be the third?
*  I mean, I think, you know, of the three great masters of the 20th century,
*  Joyce, Bruce and Kafka, we live in Kafka's world.
*  So I would probably say The Trial or The Castle or both of them.
*  So that's four books.
*  Salman Rushdie. Thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
