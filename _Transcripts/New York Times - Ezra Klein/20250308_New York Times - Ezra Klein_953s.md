Video Description: Right-wing populism thrives on scarcity. The answer is abundance. But a politics of abundance will work only if Democrats confront where their approach has failed. 
This video essay is adapted from my forthcoming book, “Abundance,” which I wrote with Derek Thompson.

# There Is a Liberal Answer to Elon Musk | The Ezra Klein Show
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4)
*  Democrats have a problem that runs deeper than the 2024 election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=0.0s)]
*  They have a problem that runs deeper than Elon Musk's assault on the government. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=4.4s)]
*  Look at the places they govern. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=9.0s)]
*  Strongholds like New York and Illinois and where I'm from, California. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=11.24s)]
*  They're losing people. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=16.0s)]
*  Since the pandemic started, California is seeing an exodus, a mass exodus. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=17.6s)]
*  In 2023, California saw a net loss of 268,000 residents. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=21.92s)]
*  In New York, 179,000. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=28.0s)]
*  New York City is losing some folks, right, some residents. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=30.32s)]
*  But it turns out that New York State is also seeing the population drop. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=33.04s)]
*  And in Illinois... [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=37.32s)]
*  Illinois residents have been fleeing the state at an alarming rate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=38.44s)]
*  The state's population has been in decline for the tenth year in a row. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=42.36s)]
*  Why are all these people leaving? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=46.88s)]
*  In surveys, the dominant reason is simply this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=48.64s)]
*  The cost of living is too high. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=51.64s)]
*  It is too expensive to get childcare. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  It's almost like paying another mortgage. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=56.4s)]
*  It is too expensive to buy a home. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=58.4s)]
*  Very unrealistic to be able to put a down payment on a $2 million home [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=60.24s)]
*  with two kids surviving. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=64.48s)]
*  You end up having to live too far from your work. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=66.6s)]
*  And so they're going to places where all of that is cheaper. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=68.92s)]
*  Every day someone is moving to the Florida area. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=71.96s)]
*  She got an apartment three times the size of the one she had in Manhattan. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=74.4s)]
*  Plus, there's a wraparound deck. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=78.56s)]
*  Yeah, I can definitely understand. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=80.44s)]
*  Go get that, you know, four-bedroom, three-bath house I had in Texas. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=81.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=84.28s)]
*  I know these families. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  These families are my friends. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=87.48s)]
*  I've lived with them in these places. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=89.4s)]
*  And I've watched many of them move away from the place they love, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  the city they wanted to raise their children, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  because they could not afford to live there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  You cannot be the party of working families [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=100.0s)]
*  when the places you govern or places working families cannot afford to live. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  You are not the party of working families [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=106.44s)]
*  when the places you govern or places working families cannot afford to live. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=108.84s)]
*  In the American political system, to lose people is to lose power. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=113.8s)]
*  If these trends hold, the 2030 census will shift the Electoral College sharply to the right. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=118.92s)]
*  The states that Kamala Harris won in 2024 will lose House seats and Electoral College votes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=124.56s)]
*  The states that Trump won will gain them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=131.92s)]
*  So in that Electoral College, a Democrat could win every single state Harris won in 2024 [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=134.8s)]
*  and also win Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=140.84s)]
*  and still lose the presidency. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  There is a policy failure haunting blue states. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=147.88s)]
*  It has become too hard to build and too expensive to live [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=151.04s)]
*  in the places where Democrats govern. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=154.96s)]
*  Our politics is split right now between a left that defends government even when it doesn't work [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  and a right that wants to destroy government even when it is working. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=162.24s)]
*  What we need is a political party that actually makes government work. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=165.84s)]
*  Democrats can be that party. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=169.12s)]
*  They should be that party. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=170.48s)]
*  But it requires them to confront what they have done to make government fail. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=172.56s)]
*  I could tell you a dozen stories. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  In my new book I do. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  But let me tell you here just one. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  In 1982, so more than 40 years ago, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill to study [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=186.32s)]
*  what it would take to build a high-speed rail system across the state. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=192.44s)]
*  Make a choice. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=195.28s)]
*  Change the chemistry of the country. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=196.32s)]
*  He liked what he saw and so did California's voters. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=198.72s)]
*  In 1996, California formed a high-speed rail authority to plan for construction. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=202.08s)]
*  High-speed rail is not some futuristic technology like nuclear fusion or flying cars. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=207.68s)]
*  Japan broke ground on high-speed rail back in 1959. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=213.36s)]
*  You can ride on these trains elsewhere. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=217.28s)]
*  I have ridden on these trains. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=223.8s)]
*  So in 2008, California's voters approved Prop 1A, which set aside $10 billion to begin [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=227.48s)]
*  construction on a high-speed rail line that would connect Los Angeles and San Francisco. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=232.0s)]
*  It would run through the Central Valley. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=236.2s)]
*  It would get there in under two hours and 40 minutes. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=239.2s)]
*  And it would cost, they thought, $33.6 billion. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=242.76s)]
*  California's high-speed rail authority estimated we'd be able to ride that train by the year 2020. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=247.4s)]
*  And the news kept getting better for high-speed rail. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=252.96s)]
*  In 2009, President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act into law. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=255.56s)]
*  That had hundreds of billions of dollars to build the infrastructure of the future. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=260.88s)]
*  And high-speed rail in particular had captured Obama's imagination. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=264.48s)]
*  Imagine boarding a train in the center of a city. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=268.64s)]
*  No racing to an airport and across a terminal. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=272.16s)]
*  No delays. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=275.24s)]
*  No sitting on the tarmac. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=276.24s)]
*  No lost luggage. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=277.24s)]
*  No taking off your shoes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=278.68s)]
*  Now, all of you know this is not some fanciful pie-in-the-sky vision of the future. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=282.44s)]
*  It is now. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=287.0s)]
*  It is happening right now. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=288.0s)]
*  It's been happening for decades. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=289.2s)]
*  The problem is it's been happening elsewhere. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=291.28s)]
*  Not here. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=294.04s)]
*  Obama wanted it to happen here. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=295.28s)]
*  In California, where the voters had already begun planning and funding high-speed rail, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=297.32s)]
*  was the obvious place. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=301.72s)]
*  And the political stars had just kept aligning. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=303.28s)]
*  High-speed rail's foremost champion returned. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=306.56s)]
*  In the most expensive campaign in California history. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=309.2s)]
*  When Jerry Brown won back the governor's mansion almost 30 years after leaving it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=312.68s)]
*  Now 30 years later, within weeks of a revised business plan that will enable us to begin [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=317.36s)]
*  initial construction before the year is out. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=323.68s)]
*  But it didn't happen. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=327.28s)]
*  By 2018, it was brutally clear that nothing was going to be rideable by 2020. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=328.28s)]
*  And the cost estimate, it wasn't $33 billion anymore. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=333.84s)]
*  It had risen and risen and risen. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=337.67999999999995s)]
*  By 2018, it was $76 billion. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=340.2s)]
*  Next level, let's level about the high-speed rail. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=342.88s)]
*  The next year, 2019, Gavin Newsom, who had served as Brown's lieutenant governor, succeeded [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=349.79999999999995s)]
*  him as governor. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  Right now there simply isn't a path to get from Sacramento to San Diego, let alone from [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=355.67999999999995s)]
*  San Francisco to LA. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=362.28s)]
*  I wish there were. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=363.96s)]
*  However, we do have the capacity to complete a high-speed rail link between Merced and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=365.76s)]
*  Bakersfield. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  Merced and Bakersfield, a line no one would have authorized if it had been the plan that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=373.40000000000003s)]
*  was presented in the first place. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=378.2s)]
*  The latest estimate just for that line is $35 billion, as much as the entire LA to SF [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=380.08s)]
*  line was estimated to cost in 2008. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=386.56s)]
*  And even this Merced and Bakersfield line, it's not predicted to begin carrying passengers [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=389.56s)]
*  until sometime between 2030 and 2033, if all goes well. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=394.0s)]
*  I'm told now that finishing the LA to San Francisco line would cost $110 billion at [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  least. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=404.03999999999996s)]
*  California doesn't have anywhere near that kind of funding for high-speed rail. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=405.44s)]
*  So they're building what they can right now with no idea of how they're ever going to finish. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=408.96s)]
*  What went so wrong here? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=415.28s)]
*  In October of 2023, I went to Fresno, California. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=417.44s)]
*  What I heard as I walked that track with the engineers who have built it and the people [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  overseeing it, it wasn't engineering problems. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=425.12s)]
*  It was political problems. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=428.96s)]
*  There are parts of the high-speed rail line that intersect with freight rail lines. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=431.2s)]
*  But the freight rail lines, they're so busy in the holiday season that some impose a construction [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=434.88s)]
*  moratorium from October to December. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=438.88s)]
*  So in those areas, construction just stops for months every year. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=441.44s)]
*  Why did the authority begin construction in the Central Valley rather than near the megacities? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=445.32s)]
*  Well, one reason was that when California applied for federal money, the Obama administration [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=450.8s)]
*  wanted bids that would improve air quality in poor communities. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=454.72s)]
*  And so the $3 billion the federal government offered, it wasn't really to build high-speed [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=458.44s)]
*  rail. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=462.96s)]
*  It was to begin building high-speed rail in ways that addressed air pollution in specific [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=463.96s)]
*  communities. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=467.92s)]
*  The Central Valley is poor and more polluted than coastal California. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=469.6s)]
*  So federal funding went there and so did the initial construction. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=473.24s)]
*  But that made it less likely high-speed rail would generate the ridership, the political [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=476.96s)]
*  support or the financial backing to ever actually finish. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=480.4s)]
*  And that, of course, is bad for air pollution in Fresno and across the state. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=484.52s)]
*  Trains are cleaner than cars, but high-speed rail has had to clear every inch of its route [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=490.44s)]
*  through environmental reviews, with lawsuits lurking around every corner. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=494.12s)]
*  The environmental review process began in 2012 and by 2024, 12 years later, it still [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=498.44s)]
*  wasn't done. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=503.91999999999996s)]
*  What has taken so long on high-speed rail is not hammering nails or pouring concrete. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=505.92s)]
*  Good morning all. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=510.8s)]
*  Welcome to the California High-Speed Rail Finance and Audit Committee meeting. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=511.8s)]
*  It's process. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=515.0s)]
*  It's negotiating. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=516.0s)]
*  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=517.0s)]
*  I would like to go over some important information for members of the public. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=518.36s)]
*  Speakers will be called upon in the order that their hands are raised. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=521.68s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=523.92s)]
*  Elmer Lazardi here on behalf of the California Labor Federation. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=524.92s)]
*  The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=526.64s)]
*  So my question is, why do we have to wait almost a whole year later to find out that [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=528.28s)]
*  they're not in compliance? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=532.56s)]
*  With courts, with funders, with business owners, with homeowners, with farm owners, with other [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=534.48s)]
*  parts of the government. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=539.04s)]
*  Those negotiations cost time, which cost money. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=540.76s)]
*  Those negotiations lead to changes in the route or the design or the construction, and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=543.88s)]
*  that costs money, and that costs time. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=549.0s)]
*  Those negotiations are the product of decades of liberal policies meant to protect against [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=551.96s)]
*  government abuses. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=556.9200000000001s)]
*  And they may do that, but they also prevent government from building quickly or affordably. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=558.2s)]
*  In the time California has spent failing to complete its 500-mile high-speed rail system, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=563.28s)]
*  China has built more than 23,000 miles of high-speed rail. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=568.52s)]
*  The Chinese government doesn't spend years debating with judges over whether it needs [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=572.52s)]
*  to move a storage facility. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=575.64s)]
*  Its power leads to abuse and imperiousness. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=577.6s)]
*  It also leads to trains. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=581.12s)]
*  And look, I don't want America to become China. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=586.32s)]
*  But I do want it to be able to build trains as China can, as Europe can, as Japan can. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=589.08s)]
*  The Second Avenue subway project in New York City. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=599.96s)]
*  This is the first major expansion of the New York City subway in more than 50 years. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=602.36s)]
*  It was the most expensive subway project by kilometer the world has ever seen. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=607.12s)]
*  Has New York dramatically reformed its policies to make the next one easier and cheaper? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, next stop, 125th Street. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=616.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=619.7199999999999s)]
*  That comes with a $6.3 billion price tag, far more than Phase One. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=620.7199999999999s)]
*  No, of course it hasn't. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  Do you remember the big dig? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=628.88s)]
*  What is the big dig? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=630.4399999999999s)]
*  The big dig! [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  It's pretty hard to ignore the big dig. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=633.8399999999999s)]
*  It is everywhere. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=635.8399999999999s)]
*  Did the decades of delay and the billions of cost overruns on Boston's big dig change [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=637.3199999999999s)]
*  how Massachusetts builds? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=642.8s)]
*  Not really. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=644.4399999999999s)]
*  California. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=646.12s)]
*  California has the worst housing problem in the country. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=647.28s)]
*  In 2022, the state had 12% of the country's population. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=649.96s)]
*  It had 30% of the country's homeless population. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=653.64s)]
*  And it had 50% of its unsheltered homeless population. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=657.04s)]
*  Has this unfathomable failure led to California building more homes than it was building a [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=662.68s)]
*  decade ago? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=666.64s)]
*  No, it hasn't. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=668.28s)]
*  In the last few decades, Democrats took a wrong turn. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=670.4s)]
*  They became the party that believes in government, that defends government, not the party that [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=673.48s)]
*  forces government to work. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=678.4s)]
*  This is an awkward time to make this argument. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=680.52s)]
*  Elon Musk and Doge are trying to raise the federal government to the ground. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=683.16s)]
*  Musk has been a loud critic of California's high-speed rail project, calling it a fraud, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=687.64s)]
*  saying we should just let him build his imaginary hyperloop instead. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=692.16s)]
*  But in reality, he's never offered a plan that would work to build anything better or [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=696.1999999999999s)]
*  cheaper than high-speed rail. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=699.36s)]
*  His alternative, in truth, is nothing. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=701.32s)]
*  And I refuse to accept that this is our choice. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=704.72s)]
*  A Democratic party that will not make government work, and a Republican party that wants to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=707.32s)]
*  make government fail. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=711.48s)]
*  What those two parties have created over decades is scarcity. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=713.24s)]
*  Scarcity of homes, of good infrastructure, of clean energy, of public goods. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=717.96s)]
*  But the difference between them is that the populist right loves scarcity. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=722.86s)]
*  It is powered by scarcity. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=726.44s)]
*  When there's not enough to go around, we look with suspicion on anyone who might take [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=729.4s)]
*  what we have. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=733.4s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump could have run on more. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=734.4s)]
*  He could have run on bringing Texas's housing policies to the nation. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=737.76s)]
*  In Houston, there's no zoning code, so building is easy, and the average home sells for a [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=742.56s)]
*  bit over $300,000. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=746.88s)]
*  Compare that to Los Angeles, where the average home now sells for over a million dollars. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=749.28s)]
*  Instead, the housing crisis became a cudgel they used against immigrants. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=752.88s)]
*  25 million illegal aliens competing with Americans for scarce homes is one of the most significant [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=757.44s)]
*  drivers of home prices in the country. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=762.96s)]
*  As just one example, a vivid one, look at the explosion in rent in Springfield, Ohio, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=765.88s)]
*  where Kamala has resettled the 20,000 Haitians. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=772.2s)]
*  Trump could have run on the success Operation Warp Speed had in speeding up the COVID vaccines. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=777.24s)]
*  Instead, he's slashing government funding for science and medical research and firing [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=783.08s)]
*  scientists. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=787.24s)]
*  He could have run on making it easier to build energy of all kinds in America. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=788.6800000000001s)]
*  Instead, he's trying to destroy the solar and wind industries. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=791.96s)]
*  He could have run on making it easier for Americans to make things and to trade them [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=797.44s)]
*  with the world. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=801.08s)]
*  Instead, he's trying to cut international trade, imposing tariffs and alienating partners. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=802.08s)]
*  Elon Musk is rich because of SpaceX and Tesla, companies that are built on federal subsidies. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=807.4000000000001s)]
*  But he's slashing what government can do rather than reimagining what it can do. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=813.76s)]
*  The answer to a politics of scarcity is a politics of abundance. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=821.16s)]
*  A politics that asks what it is that people really need and then organizes government [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=825.04s)]
*  and markets to make sure there is enough of it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=829.56s)]
*  That doesn't give you the childlessly simple divides that have so deformed our politics. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=832.68s)]
*  Government is not simply good at all times. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=837.56s)]
*  It is not simply bad at all times. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=839.4399999999999s)]
*  Sometimes government has to get out of the way, like in housing. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=842.52s)]
*  Sometimes it has to take a central role, like in creating markets or organizing resources [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=845.84s)]
*  for technologies that do not yet exist and that we need and that are too risky for markets [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=851.28s)]
*  to fund. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=855.76s)]
*  There is going to be pressure over these next few years as Elon Musk and Donald Trump dismantle [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=857.4399999999999s)]
*  the federal government to see only the sins of the magerite. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=862.36s)]
*  And don't get me wrong, the magerite is dangerous. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=866.36s)]
*  A resistance is needed. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  But so too is an alternative. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=871.64s)]
*  If liberals do not want Americans to turn to the false promises of strongmen, they need [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=874.48s)]
*  to offer them the fruits of effective government. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=879.1999999999999s)]
*  But if Democrats are to become the party of abundance, they have to confront their own [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=881.56s)]
*  role in creating scarcity. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=885.88s)]
*  Liberals spent a generation working at every level of government and society to make it [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=888.24s)]
*  harder to build recklessly. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=892.4399999999999s)]
*  They got used to crafting coalitions and legislation that gave everyone a bit of what they wanted, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=894.28s)]
*  even if it meant the final product was astonishingly expensive or decades late or perhaps never [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=899.56s)]
*  found its way to completion at all. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=904.8s)]
*  Then they explained away government's failures. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=907.4s)]
*  They excused their own selfishness, putting out yard signs saying no human being is illegal. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=910.24s)]
*  Kindness is everything, even as they fought affordable housing nearby and pushed the working [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  class out of the cities they ran. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=920.4399999999999s)]
*  To unmake this machine will be painful. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=923.16s)]
*  But it's necessary. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=925.36s)]
*  If liberals don't make government work, zealots like Elon Musk are going to come in and burn [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=927.6s)]
*  it down. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwjxVRfUV_4&t=932.9200000000001s)]
