# This Is a Very Weird Moment in the History of Drug Laws
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20BsfpwEcjE)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  In 2020, voters in Oregon passed a ballot measure, a drug reform policy that was beyond
*  what I ever thought would pass in any state in America.
*  Overnight, Oregon became the first state in the country to decriminalize most street drugs.
*  Even drugs like cocaine, heroin, meth, and oxycodone.
*  It's a sea change.
*  Measure 110, which was passed by 58% of Oregon voters, treats active drug users as potential
*  patients rather than criminals.
*  I've been involved in drug policy reform for a long time.
*  I got into it in high school.
*  And this was not a politics that seemed possible back then.
*  In that era, the idea that you would have a state decriminalize heroin possession, I
*  mean, it was unthinkable.
*  But in the coming decades, there'd be a real turn on the war on drugs, the over policing,
*  the mass incarceration, the racism, the broken families.
*  It was not achieving as far as anybody could tell anybody's policy goals.
*  So we began to move in this other direction.
*  Oregon was at the vanguard of this, but it wasn't alone.
*  In Washington state, you saw the Supreme Court overturned the law that had made a lot of
*  drug possessions and felonies.
*  In a bunch of different cities, you had these very liberal district attorneys who instead
*  of running on tough on crime platforms, were running against over policing, against mass
*  incarceration.
*  Something that had really never been tried before in America was all of a sudden being
*  tried.
*  We are moving towards a radically different equilibrium than anybody had imagined, even
*  just a few years before on drugs.
*  You could walk down the streets you can right now in many states and buy all kinds of cannabis
*  products from shops.
*  It was, again, unthinkable.
*  But this politics and these policies are not working out the way people hoped.
*  Chase Boudin, who was the district attorney in San Francisco, one of these very sort of
*  liberal set of reformers, he was recalled.
*  Legislation was passed rebuilding an enforcement structure around drugs in Washington state.
*  There are a lot of concerns and I think quite right ones about how cannabis legalization
*  and particularly cannabis commercialization is working out in a bunch of places.
*  And in Oregon, Measure 110 was gutted.
*  The results of it had not been what many of the advocates had hoped for.
*  Drug policy feels very unsettled to me right now.
*  The war on drugs was a failure, often a cruel one.
*  The war on the war on drugs has not been the success its advocates had hoped.
*  So what comes next?
*  Keith Humphreys is a professor at Stanford University who specializes in addiction and
*  drug policy.
*  He's advised the White House, California, the UK.
*  I always find that he balances compassion and rigor unusually well.
*  So I wanted to have him walk me through what he has seen and where he's landed.
*  As always, my email for guest suggestions for reflections, Ezra Klein show at NY times.com.
*  Keith Humphreys, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks Ezra, good to talk to you.
*  There's a tendency to just use this term drugs.
*  And that tendency just belies a huge amount of variation I think in how people think about
*  how they think about opioids, how they think about stimulants, how they think about psychedelics,
*  how they think about cannabis, alcohol, caffeine.
*  Is this a useful term?
*  So drug is an incredibly vague term that covers an enormous number of drugs that have very
*  different properties.
*  The biggest one I think is the capacity to instill addiction.
*  People don't get addicted to LSD, for example, but they do get addicted to heroin.
*  That's really important.
*  They do get addicted to nicotine.
*  That's really important.
*  So she would think about those drugs differently, the ones that have the ability to sort of
*  generate an illness with obsessive compulsion to use in the face of destructive consequences
*  over and over and over again.
*  Those belong in their own class, I think.
*  The second thing is that we should stop pretending that legal and illegal drugs are so different
*  for lots of reasons.
*  We could learn much more about what to do with illegal drugs if we look at legal drugs.
*  When I talk to policymakers, they say, well, I know what I don't want, and that's a carceral,
*  racist war on drugs.
*  And say, okay, I'm glad that option is off the table.
*  That of course leaves millions and millions of other options to choose from.
*  And how some people have framed that is there's really only two choices here.
*  You can have that horrible thing, or you can throw the switch the other way.
*  Tolerance, acceptance, public sale, and that's going to be better.
*  And the problem with that argument, even before we get into what happened in places like Oregon,
*  is the number one drug that kills people on the planet is cigarettes.
*  The number one drug associated with arrests, violence, and incarceration is alcohol.
*  Those drugs are legal.
*  It's not the drugs suddenly become easy to deal with once they're legal.
*  You get to pick the set of problems you have, as our mutual friend Mark Climon used to say,
*  but you don't get to get rid of those problems.
*  So people are right to identify substantial cost to prohibition of drugs, or for that
*  matter of everything.
*  But that is different than saying there is some other framework that doesn't also include
*  pretty substantial costs.
*  So this major drug policy reform went into effect in Oregon in 2021, measure 110.
*  It passes.
*  What happens next?
*  Part of what happens is exactly what the reformers hoped would happen, which is that there's
*  a dramatic drop in arrests, arrests for drug possession and arrests for drug dealing.
*  So they say, wow, that's a victory.
*  On the other hand, some of the other aspects of it didn't work out the way people planned.
*  So there was a system that they thought would encourage people to enter treatment in replacement
*  of criminal penalties.
*  You'd be written a ticket, let's say if you were using fentanyl on a park bench, and it
*  said there's a $100 fine for doing this, but you don't have to pay the fine.
*  call this toll free number and you can get a health assessment and a potential referral
*  to treatment.
*  Well, it turned out that over 95% of people got those tickets, simply threw them away,
*  which keeping with the spirit of the law, there was no consequence for doing that.
*  Hardly anybody called it.
*  The new body they set up to distribute the new funds had very serious management problems
*  because of people, they may have been terrific human beings, but they weren't actually experienced
*  it.
*  How do you run a government bureaucracy?
*  So there was no real improvement in the availability of treatment, no real improvement in the number
*  of people interested in seeking it.
*  And those things may well have contributed to Oregon having a very high overdose rate.
*  So currently going up about 40% per year, four zero.
*  Of course, some of that is due to fentanyl, which is raising, I'm here in California,
*  our rates up 5%, but it's certainly not up 40%.
*  And the last thing is the intangible.
*  And I say this as someone who goes to Oregon a lot and talks to people there almost every
*  week, which is just the change in neighborhoods was really palpable of what it was like to
*  go out in the street or try to go to a park, how much visible drug use you saw, how much
*  disorder connected to it.
*  And this was accentuated even further by the fact that pandemic, there were fewer people
*  on the street who had the choice.
*  So the experience became more frightening as people were perhaps outnumbered in their
*  neighborhood by people who had clearly visible problems were using drugs.
*  And that generated significant and I think understandable upset as to how things were
*  going in Oregon.
*  So not everybody agrees that measure 110 was a failure, certainly not as a policy.
*  I mean, it definitely failed politically.
*  The Drug Policy Alliance says that it failed because of disinformation, because there's
*  a concerted effort to undermine it.
*  And they cite data from the Oregon Health Authority saying that, look, health and needs
*  screenings increased by almost 300 percent, substance use disorder treatment increased
*  by 143 percent.
*  Is there some argument to this that we're looking at the wrong measures and judged according
*  to its goals 110 was actually kind of working?
*  If what you cared about the most was a drop in drug arrests and involvement of people
*  who use drugs and deal drugs in the criminal justice system, then it was success clearly
*  was very little contact anymore between law enforcement and people who sell and deal drugs.
*  But on the health side, no, I don't think that.
*  And those statistics on treatment, I believe, count a lot of sort of one time consultations.
*  I think what most people, particularly people who love someone who has an addiction are
*  looking for is evidence on people getting better, people getting into recovery, not
*  just at some point having some transitory contact with the system.
*  There's another argument that's made in the Drug Policy Alliance document and other things
*  I've seen and that has occurred to me, too, because when I think about Oregon, when I
*  think about San Francisco, when I think about Washington state, I mean, you're talking about
*  places with very broken housing markets.
*  We'll talk, I'm sure, more about the Tenderloin.
*  But the Tenderloin is dystopic in the way the Tenderloin is dystopic because it is a
*  giant homeless encampment.
*  And that was true well before the current wave of drug policy liberalization.
*  And so one argument here is that the drug system is being blamed for policymakers'
*  inability to solve these other problems.
*  Is there something to that?
*  There's an intense argument out here in the Bay Area between people who say, look, the
*  homeless crisis is just a side effect of addiction.
*  And people say, look, the addiction crisis is just a side effect of homelessness.
*  And I would say they're both wrong in that even within my personal group of acquaintances,
*  I know people who lost their home because of an addiction.
*  And it's not that the housing market discharged them.
*  They had an empty property, but they were out on the streets.
*  And then there are people who lost their housing and then were living next to drug markets
*  on the streets and developed an addiction there.
*  So I don't think we can sort of separate that Gordian knot.
*  And I don't know if in policy terms we have to.
*  I mean, I think we should be able to pursue policies that increase the access to housing
*  and still work on policies that reduce the damage from addiction.
*  So to go back to Oregon and one of the theories that was operating there was that we're going
*  to move more money into treatment.
*  We're going to make it easier and safer in the sense that you will not be arrested for
*  seeking treatment.
*  We're going to make it easier and safer for you to seek treatment.
*  We're going to make it cheap to seek treatment.
*  Why didn't more people seek treatment?
*  A theory reflects a misunderstanding about the nature of addiction, which is that it
*  is like, say, you know, chronic pain or depression, conditions that feel lousy for the person
*  who has them all day long and they will do anything to get rid of them.
*  Drug addiction is not like that.
*  It has many painful experiences.
*  It destroys people's lives, but drug use feels in the short term incredibly good.
*  That is why people do it.
*  They're getting intense reward.
*  So they are ambivalent about giving that up in a way no one with chronic pain is ambivalent
*  about giving up chronic pain and no one with depression is ambivalent about giving up depression.
*  The other point about it is a huge number of the problems from drug use and addiction
*  fall on other people rather than the person concerned.
*  And so people like me work in this field, we get calls and calls and calls from mothers,
*  fathers, brothers, sisters, children concerned about their loved ones.
*  But it's very rare we get a call from somebody concerned about their own use.
*  You know, take the law out of it and look at a drug that is legal and widely accepted.
*  Studies of people who seek treatment for an alcohol problem, slightly over nine in 10
*  of those people say they were pressured to come.
*  And pressure might be family pressure.
*  Mom and dad said, or my spouse said, you know, this keeps up.
*  I'm moving out.
*  The boss said, you know, one more day drunk at work and you're fired.
*  Doctor said, you keep doing this, you will be dead in six months.
*  It could be this is your fourth or fifth arrest for drunk driving and your lawyer says, you
*  better get into treatment because the judge otherwise might throw you into the penitentiary.
*  That is overwhelmingly the situation of people seeking treatment, pressure from outside.
*  So the theory that let's just remove all pressure, no legal pressure, no disapproval, then people
*  will spontaneously say, okay, I really want to make a change and I'll come in.
*  Look, those of us who do this for a living, we pray for patients like that.
*  It's great when they come in, but that's just a very rare person.
*  Let me ask about this from the other direction, which is maybe this all just wasn't nearly
*  liberal enough because one of the arguments made, and I do think there's evidence behind
*  it is people are getting stuff they don't know.
*  And the reason people die from fentanyl-laced heroin or simply fentanyl that they thought
*  was heroin is because they don't have a source they can trust.
*  Part of the difficulty here is yes, people end up addicted.
*  We don't have really good treatments for addiction that we can come back to whether you think
*  that is a true claim.
*  And then we also make it very difficult for people and dangerous for people to get what
*  they need to avoid withdrawal, to keep feeling normal.
*  And if we made that easier on them, if we made it so they didn't have to go to a place
*  like the Tenderloin and can instead get something safe, they would not die from overdose.
*  They would not die from fentanyl-laced heroin.
*  Is there validity to that?
*  Yeah, well, certainly using fentanyl in an illicit market is extraordinarily dangerous.
*  And my colleagues and I are trying to figure out the death rate per year of a regular user.
*  It might be as high as 5%.
*  So that is an extraordinarily dangerous thing to do.
*  And the arguments you're making have been influential in this region to the point that
*  if you go up slightly even further in Pacific Northwest into Canada and British Columbia,
*  they've gone so far to say it's the government's job to supply these drugs because it's, you
*  know, prohibition makes things more dangerous.
*  So we have a positive obligation to do this.
*  But the problem with that reasoning is we did flood communities with legally made, consistent
*  quality, clearly labeled opioids for years.
*  And the net effect was millions of people getting addicted and hundreds of thousands
*  of people dying.
*  That's in fact how we got here.
*  I think everyone knows what OxyContin is, all the other opioids that were really pushed
*  out there.
*  So it's just really hard to sustain that argument that at a population level, huge access to
*  addictive drugs is not going to cause a lot of addiction and overdose as long as they're
*  clearly labeled and of consistent quality.
*  If that were true, we've never had an opioid crisis.
*  So measure 110 passes in 2020.
*  It goes into effect in 2021.
*  What happens to it in 2023?
*  At that point, overdoses were way up and popular sentiment has shifted pretty dramatically.
*  Quite a few people felt burned.
*  You know, they hadn't gotten what they'd been promised.
*  And that included people who, for example, had relatives who were addicted who they assumed
*  would be getting into treatment and recovery and then weren't able to get services.
*  Neighborhoods are decaying.
*  Polling showed that about two-thirds of the Oregon population wanted measure 110 repealed
*  in part or in whole.
*  And interestingly, those sentiments were even stronger among black and Hispanic Oregon
*  residents.
*  In response to all this, both houses by very large margins replaced measure 10 with a different
*  approach to drug policy.
*  It restored the ability to impose criminal penalties, to use those penalties, particularly
*  to leverage people to change the behavior, for example, by restoring drug courts and
*  other kinds of diversion and monitoring programs.
*  It is definitely not correct to say they reinstated the war on drugs because it has to be remembered.
*  Oregon never really had a war on drugs policy.
*  You know, they were the first state in the nation to decriminalize marijuana over 50
*  years ago.
*  In fact, they decriminalized marijuana.
*  They had a very low rate of putting nonviolent criminals into prisons.
*  So it was more a restoration of that progressive liberty loving approach that they'd had before.
*  It supplemented with a lot more funding for treatment, which is something they've had
*  a lot of problems standing up for years, which had nothing to do with measure 110.
*  The treatment system was in very bad shape before measure 110, and it still is.
*  If you've been around drug policy conversations for a long time, you'll have heard a lot.
*  I have heard a lot about Portugal.
*  And Portugal is a place where they decriminalize drugs.
*  And it has been a much more sustainable, solid policy.
*  So what is different about Portugal?
*  Portugal is different in policy and different in culture.
*  So they definitely don't throw people in prison and it's decriminalized.
*  But they do have what are called dissuasion commissions that do assessments of people,
*  say who are arrested in the street for using drugs, and you have to show up to this assessment.
*  And they can push and nudge people to seek care.
*  And they can also apply penalties that they want to do.
*  Like they can say, you're a cab driver, you've been caught using cocaine, and we're going
*  to take your cab license away until you seek treatment and stop using cocaine.
*  Things like that.
*  So it's a civil war and drugs approach, but it is a push in the policy.
*  And that has never been taken on seriously by American advocates who cite Portugal.
*  Portugal also has universal health care.
*  We do not have that.
*  We are the only developed Western country that doesn't have that.
*  So that makes it easier to get help irrespective of what the laws are.
*  And Portugal had, at least at the time of their decriminalization, a very nice network
*  of treatment services and harm reduction services for people.
*  And all that together worked in the policy mix.
*  Other point is the culture of Portugal is much more family oriented.
*  It's much more communitarian than American general, and certainly much more true than
*  our freedom loving sort of libertarian Pacific coast.
*  If you spend time in Lisbon, you have a common experience of running into people and say,
*  where are you born?
*  And they'll say, well, Lisbon, you know, and where were your parents born?
*  Lisbon, and they still live in my neighborhood, and my grandparents live in my neighborhood
*  too.
*  I hear this in San Francisco, it seems like everybody or Portland, everybody is from somewhere
*  else and many people actually moved to the West to get away from everybody else, to get
*  away from social constraint.
*  And I want to be my own person.
*  Well, Portugal is the opposite of that.
*  So there's a lot of constraint on behavior.
*  You know, it's loving constraint, but it is constrained.
*  Those sort of boundaries around people's behavior that don't exist out in the West, with the
*  exception of recent immigrant communities, which by the way, have very low rates of drug
*  problems.
*  This is something that I always think people underestimate, at least about San Francisco,
*  which is the one of the cities I know the best, which is that it is a culture of enormous
*  tolerance.
*  And that is a lot of what makes San Francisco remarkable, what has made it a home for LGBTQ
*  people when that was a very rare thing to be.
*  What has made it open to all these weird ideas from computer scientists and strange nerds
*  who came around with their thoughts about AI and their thoughts about, you know, visual
*  operating systems.
*  And people don't like necessarily the dark side of this open, tolerant, non-judgmental
*  way of looking at the world.
*  There's a bit of a divided soul, a difficulty judging, a discomfort with paternalism, and
*  a kind of optimism that if you let subcultures have their freedom and kind of grapple their
*  way forward, they'll find their way to an equilibrium and that we should be very, very,
*  very skeptical of heavy-handed, particularly law enforcement as a way of changing culture.
*  That is a very nice description of the city we both love.
*  And we would be much poorer without San Francisco's embrace of individual freedom and all the
*  great things that it gives, which you just articulated.
*  To me, the resolution here is taking addiction seriously as a problem.
*  So if you look at somebody who is, you know, using methamphetamine, you know, five times
*  a day, you could say, well, that is really an expression of their individual freedom.
*  I need to respect that.
*  But if you recognize the likelihood that they are not particularly free because they are
*  addicted, the inconsistency disappears.
*  And so I feel personally no contradiction between saying the state should intervene
*  with pressure, for example, mandating people into treatment.
*  For me, that doesn't conflict with individual freedom at all.
*  So when I talk to somebody who said, look, you need to just let people do what they want,
*  I say, look, I volunteer in the tenderloin and I carry naloxone, the overdose rescue
*  medication with me.
*  If someone were in front of me in overdose and dying, should I administer naloxone?
*  Even though the person can't consent, they're unconscious.
*  And I've never had anyone say, you're right, you should just respect their right to die.
*  They say, no, of course you should do that.
*  Conceding the principle that there are times that the thing we can do the most to help
*  other people is take care of them when they were not in fit state to take care of themselves.
*  Is that a strong man, though?
*  I can't really think of people, at least that I have heard, arguing that somebody under
*  the throes of heroin addiction is free and is choosing the life they live, that they're
*  likely to be happy with the world they now exist in.
*  One of the really striking things about this new rhetoric about drug policy out here is
*  how rarely addiction is even mentioned.
*  The fact there's so much focus on drug overdose, which is, of course, terrible, but that that
*  is treated as the only index and not addiction.
*  It reflects a viewpoint that that's not either an important thing or not that real a thing.
*  Because if it were, you would note that in the heyday of wild opioid prescribing, there
*  were fewer overdoses, but there were far more people who were addicted to those substances
*  and that made their lives dramatically worse.
*  I also see the lack of attention to addiction in the investment in harm reduction without
*  the idea of using it as a springboard into treatment, which to me is a very novel idea
*  that's only become more powerful in the last couple of years where people feel like that
*  in itself is the goal versus trying to eliminate addiction and get somebody into recovery.
*  So this is complicated, I think, because there's this interaction in this period between what
*  you might call elite and mass drug culture.
*  In this period, you have the rise of a lot of super popular podcasters like Joe Rogan
*  and Tim Ferriss, who are very open about their psychedelic use.
*  You have Michael Pollan's great book on psychedelics, How to Change Your Mind.
*  I do a bunch of podcasts about psychedelics.
*  You have a book by Carl Hart, who's a well-known drug researcher at Columbia called Drug Use
*  for Grown Ups, where he talks openly about using heroin to relax at the end of the day.
*  Ketamine use rises in a very public way.
*  So you have this change in drug culture among elites.
*  It becomes much more acceptable to talk about how you use drugs to improve your life that
*  I think also makes it look hypocritical to have a punitive approach, not just legally
*  but culturally, towards other kinds of drug use.
*  Do you think there's something to that?
*  Yeah, I've seen that very much too.
*  And people with a platform and they got a hearing.
*  One of the most important things to understand about, you know, Measure 110, for example,
*  is it passed easily.
*  It was not that controversial as people thought it would be.
*  And that sort of elite change, I think, was part of the dynamic.
*  And definitely you could see that in psychedelics in Oregon, which, as you know, has set up
*  an entire system to administer psychedelics as a healing force.
*  At least that's the theory.
*  These are, you know, transformative medicines, often by the way, way in advance of evidence.
*  But let's put that aside for a minute.
*  And that is a remarkable change.
*  I think the criticism you could make of people who are well off and well resourced and have
*  a lot of social capital and have access to treatment and health care whenever they need
*  it is that they could be overgeneralizing what it's like to use drugs in that situation
*  versus the situation most people find themselves in with a lot less resources and a lot fewer
*  things to catch them if they develop a problem.
*  Now, some would say, oh, the real problem is, you know, the law and it's the punishment
*  you get and all that.
*  And that can absolutely ruin people's lives.
*  There's no question to that.
*  But there's also quite a few people's lives are ruined by drugs, including cannabis, including
*  there's some people's lives have been ruined by psychedelics, and certainly people's lives
*  ruined by cocaine and fentanyl and so on.
*  You don't think about that much maybe when you are in a really comfy, well resourced
*  environment.
*  But the average person who lives in a more typical environment does think about it, does
*  have to worry about it.
*  And that gives them a different understanding of what drugs are, how risky they are and
*  what they want their government to do about them.
*  That'll make sense to me.
*  But but but something else I would say was here was that I would have described the consensus
*  for a very long time as drug use is bad.
*  And policing is good.
*  To some degree, by the time of 110 and some other reforms we were seeing in other states,
*  I think that there was and you can tell me if this tracks for you, a belief that drug
*  use is somewhere between neutral and good, depending on the drug, and policing is bad.
*  Yeah, there's no way to separate what happened in Oregon from the murder of George Floyd
*  and from Black Lives Matter.
*  The protests against police were as intense in Oregon as anywhere they were in the United
*  States and indeed throughout the region.
*  And a lot of concern, and it's got to be said, a lot of justifiable concern about racism
*  and policing and a huge portion of that was focused on drug enforcement.
*  And that flip was clearly part of why the bill passed.
*  In terms of drug use, I think there's a split.
*  So there are people who accept it's a health matter.
*  So let's sort of move to that part of the population.
*  Some of whom will say, it's not a good idea, but we should add health services and I certainly
*  wouldn't punish anybody for it.
*  To people would say, no, it is good.
*  In fact, it is actively good.
*  Drug use is good.
*  Drug use should be accepted and maybe even promoted or celebrated.
*  And the debate has been, I think, between those two strands.
*  Whereas in the 80s, it was more between drugs are bad, period, and they should be legal
*  even if they're good or bad.
*  You've written about billboards that I used to see and I thought were somewhat strange
*  around fentanyl use and showing kind of happy people.
*  These were in San Francisco, showing happy people and suggesting, you know, if you're
*  going to use this stuff, use it with friends, you know, use it around others, make sure
*  you're not doing it alone.
*  One way of looking at them was as a sort of destigmatization of this, right?
*  It's totally fine.
*  Just be safe.
*  And another way of looking at it was a total last gasp, but we don't know what to do.
*  We're going to try this approach to everything else is failing.
*  Maybe if we completely turn around our approach and just try to change the social dynamics
*  in which people use, that might have an effect on the margin.
*  So several things there you're saying I think they're important.
*  One is absolutely in the face of all this death and all all this suffering, we're all
*  desperate for solutions.
*  And I think it is good that we are thinking in very fundamental ways about what the solutions
*  are. That should be the case when you have this much suffering.
*  I think it is not irrelevant that these changes have unfolded during a pandemic where,
*  let's face it, we all went a little crazy.
*  It was very stressful.
*  It was emotional.
*  Many policy debates took on a very personal cast.
*  And we did rock between different extremes in our politics with the billboards.
*  And just to describe these billboards, what to me is interesting about them is that the
*  Public Health Department signed off on these.
*  And if they had been promoting beer, they would have been outraged by them because they
*  would say, well, you're making it look like this is something young, attractive, successful
*  people do. And it's a lot of fun.
*  And you're understating all the risk and you're going to be tempting kids.
*  You're basically giving people really bad information.
*  But it wasn't alcohol. It was fentanyl.
*  And so I guess they felt it was reasonable on the idea that this will destigmatize.
*  And then people will be comfortable talking about it and using fentanyl together.
*  And they would show people in an apartment looking like having a nice party.
*  Then they could take care of each other in the event of an overdose.
*  It would be a social event.
*  And then you could be there.
*  To me, it's an extraordinary chain of reasoning.
*  But that's where San Francisco got in 2021.
*  I lived in San Francisco during this period.
*  It also had a highly liberalizing attitude on drugs.
*  It had significant open air drug markets, particularly in the Tenderloin.
*  But what I always saw as the core thing that was infuriating people, because I lived in
*  places like D.C. that had a much higher murder rate, but where crime was much less of an
*  angry political issue, was a feeling that the government was tolerating disorder, that
*  it wasn't fighting it and failing or fighting it and failing to triumph over what's a very
*  hard problem, but that the government was allowing it, that they were allowing these
*  open air drug markets, that they were allowing people to shoot up on the street and that
*  it turned out the politics of permitting disorder were really, really, really bad.
*  Yes, they are. And I volunteer in the Tenderloin.
*  So I spent a lot of time in those neighborhoods and definitely pick up that sense.
*  And say for a number of people would express it in an even harsher way, which is the
*  government is tolerating it where I live in a way they would never tolerate it in a
*  wealthier neighborhood.
*  That could be coupled also with a sense of some of those people in the wealthier
*  neighborhoods say this should be tolerated, but they're not having to tolerate it.
*  I am. And that generates understandable anger.
*  And this has had an interesting racial dimension in my observation of it, is that a lot of this
*  tolerance has been pushed in the name of racial justice, often by white college educated
*  progressives, but is unpopular with many, many people of color who live in low income
*  neighborhoods because they're sort of paying the cost of it while it's being advocated for
*  for people who they don't even know who live in neighborhoods that don't have these kinds of
*  problems.
*  I was reading recently a lawsuit filed by residents of the Tenderloin against San Francisco.
*  And it was saying that in a way that is illegal, nonconstitutional, it's alleging that San
*  Francisco and everybody knows this to be true, was not enforcing laws in the Tenderloin the way
*  it was in other parts of the city, that it had sort of settled on containment strategy in the
*  Tenderloin. And the Tenderloin is really rough for people who have not walked around there.
*  I mean, the disorder, the despair, the difficulty is incredibly visible.
*  And one of the things that was noted in the lawsuit was that the Tenderloin has a much higher
*  ratio of children than most parts of San Francisco.
*  It has a lot of immigrant families, a lot of poor families.
*  And so this is being tolerated where really a lot of kids were.
*  And the argument was that this was not allowed where richer people lived in San Francisco.
*  And it was where these poor people lived.
*  And even knowing that, it was striking to see it laid out and to see these experiences of people
*  who were living amidst it laid out and their fury that containment was being done on their backs.
*  Why are there hundreds of dealers standing on street corners in the Tenderloin and in the south
*  of the market? They are not there to service the neighborhood, because if you live in a
*  neighborhood and your dealer lives in the neighborhood, you don't have to, you know, your
*  deal doesn't have to stand on a corner. You know each other, you can text, you can just stop by
*  and make your transactions. Open air markets are there to service strangers.
*  They're so that buyers and sellers can find each other really fast.
*  And in an open air market, it's serving people who don't live in the neighborhood.
*  There's no reason there'd be that many dealers.
*  The Tenderloin doesn't need that many dealers to pay for its own drug use.
*  So it's a legitimate gripe if you live in a neighborhood and you're trying to raise a family
*  in a neighborhood that is taken over by an open air market to say, we're taking all the harms of
*  all the drug use of the other neighborhoods where they don't allow open air dealing, but people know
*  they can just drive from there to here, pick up their drugs, and then go off about their way.
*  And that's unfair.
*  And so I sympathize with the residents of the Tenderloin who are raising that very legitimate gripe
*  about not getting equal protection under the law.
*  One question I've had about all this is how much of it is a set of policies that might have worked or
*  certainly work better than they did.
*  But Fentanyl rolled a grenade underneath this.
*  I mean, a lot of this thinking was happening in years before, like Fentanyl just completely invaded America.
*  The emergence and dominance of powerful synthetic drugs like Fentanyl among the opioids or super
*  strong methamphetamine that is now a larger share of the market than cocaine has, I think, undermined
*  basic assumptions about drug policy across the world.
*  When a kind of person who might come into, say, a methadone clinic addicted to heroin,
*  you know, their heroin use might be once a day or maybe twice a day,
*  including people who were holding jobs, people who still were in touch with their families.
*  Not that life was going well, but, you know, there was some level of manageability.
*  We now have people with Fentanyl using 10, 20, 30 times a day.
*  Their entire existence is because Fentanyl has a very short cycle of action.
*  So, you know, you wake up, you're in withdrawal.
*  The withdrawal is incredibly unpleasant.
*  You may smoke Fentanyl, smoke, smoke, smoke, and maybe it takes 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
*  Your withdrawal finally stops.
*  You smoke some more until you get high.
*  You fall asleep.
*  You wake up and you're in withdrawal and you're just really stuck like that.
*  And I see people like that.
*  I mean, I'm very optimistic about the potential recovery, you know, for addiction.
*  Those are what I've seen and those are also my values.
*  I try to approach everybody that way.
*  And I also sometimes am frightened that it's just much, much harder to help people in this state
*  when their life is that consumed by drugs, even relative to how consumed their lives were by
*  drugs like heroin and OxyContin.
*  It's really pretty frightening.
*  And we are getting it first.
*  The United States and Canada, too, are being exposed to these drugs.
*  It's interesting to note, like in Europe, they're just starting to get these drugs.
*  And whether they'll keep with their same policy makes this a really interesting question that
*  isn't entirely sure.
*  I have a colleague who says fentanyl is like an antibiotic resistant infection.
*  The stuff we always done that used to work doesn't work anymore.
*  And that's terrifying.
*  So this varies a lot by drug.
*  How would I start with the bad news first, which is the stimulants?
*  So the biggest disappointment of my career is about cocaine and methamphetamine.
*  I started my career in the late 1980s.
*  And the care that people got for those drugs then is almost the same as what they get now.
*  There's been very little progress.
*  Billions have been spent.
*  Brilliant people have tried to develop, for example, pharmacological treatments for them.
*  Nothing has panned out yet.
*  Most of the behavioral treatments don't work.
*  We have one thing that seems to work, which is contingency management, a particular way
*  of structuring and giving rewards to help people make changes in their behavior.
*  But we've had that for a very long time.
*  So the news there is kind of disappointing.
*  For alcohol, funnily enough, one of the best things we have has been around forever,
*  which is Alcoholics Anonymous.
*  And for a long time, people in my field look down on it as too folky and not medical enough.
*  And yet, there's now tremendous evidence that myself and some colleagues assembled
*  in what's called a Cochrane collaboration showing that does work, that people do, in fact,
*  as well or better in Alcoholics Anonymous as they do come to see people like myself.
*  There's also some medications available, like Campersate is one, Naltrexone is another.
*  Some people benefit from those.
*  On the opioids, we have multiple approved FDA medication.
*  Methadone has been around a very long time.
*  It's a substitute medication.
*  It is effective for many people.
*  Buprenorphine is another substitute medication, slightly different pharmacologically,
*  but also effective for a great many people.
*  And we have Naltrexone, which works differently.
*  It's sort of a blocking agent.
*  And there are people who do very well on that.
*  So those things are all good.
*  That's considered the front line.
*  You offer people medication first.
*  And people also can benefit from other kinds of things, therapies and from residential care.
*  And if somebody is out on the street with an addiction, it's not believable that they're
*  going to check in once a week for an hour with a therapist, right?
*  Their lives aren't that organized.
*  They usually need a safe, substance-free environment in which to stay.
*  And those are often in short supply.
*  So we sometimes don't have success there, not because we don't know what to do,
*  but because we haven't allocated the resources to do it.
*  But how good are any of these?
*  I mean, let's zoom in on alcohol for a minute.
*  I've known a lot of people, people I've loved, who have had very severe alcohol addictions.
*  And you can't be near that and not realize how differently different drugs act on different people.
*  Like, if I am drinking, just at some point, my body's like, that's good, we're done.
*  And there are people I know who they have burnt their life down around them.
*  And they've been in and out of residential treatment.
*  They've gone to AA.
*  Some people recover.
*  Often they really don't.
*  How likely is it if you go into AA or some of these other things that you'll recover?
*  People who seek for alcohol treatment or alcoholics anonymous can fall into three bins.
*  If you look at them about six or 12 months later, somewhere between 40, 50 percent are
*  dramatically better off.
*  Their lives are dramatically better.
*  That could be they're completely absent or they're much more absent.
*  But their lives are dramatically better.
*  Then there's another group of people who seem to be somewhat better.
*  That might be 20, 25 percent.
*  They're still having significant problems, but maybe they make some things like,
*  at least I'm not drinking and driving at the same time, or at least my spouse and I are
*  making some progress in our marital communication.
*  And then the remaining people, unfortunately, look exactly the same as the day they came to treatment.
*  They either made no progress or they made some slight progress and then relapsed.
*  The perception that we have of it tends to be driven by that last group.
*  That's because when people get better, they disappear into the woodwork.
*  So, you know, when I worked in the White House, I used to think, you know, when I walk by somebody
*  getting out of the metro who's actively using drugs or alcohol, I'm very aware.
*  That's so visible to me.
*  And yet I know every day people walk by me in suits or in recovery and I don't notice
*  them at all.
*  Just looks like another Washington lawyer or civil servant or politician.
*  So the cognitive effects of people who are doing the worst or the most vivid give us,
*  I think, a more despairing view than we ought to have.
*  How much is the risk of developing an addiction genetic?
*  Genes affect us a lot.
*  Studies across addictions show a genetic contribution.
*  You know, it varies by the substance, but at least like 30 percent, sometimes even 50 percent.
*  How much control people have just in general, like some people are more impulsive than others,
*  have a harder time thinking about the future than others from their first day on this earth.
*  And that will increase your risk for addiction.
*  If you're a very, very risk averse person who thinks a lot about the future,
*  drug use looks differently to you than if you're somebody who wants to feel good today
*  and is kind of a happy-go-lucky person.
*  Some of why we get addicted has to do with things that nobody can really control.
*  And those can be things like liking, even from the first time we use them,
*  we like drugs differently.
*  Like when my boys were little, they were in the backyard and they were climbing a tree.
*  And I said, ah, that's not how to climb a tree.
*  I'll show you how to climb a tree.
*  So when I got to the emergency room, I said, this bone is broken.
*  And I know because I can see the way it's knocked off my wrist.
*  And they nicely patched it for me.
*  And they sent me home with Vicodin.
*  It was an opioid Vicodin, bottle of 30.
*  And I said, you know, it's going to hurt.
*  So you're going to want to take these.
*  I take one.
*  I feel terrible.
*  I feel my stomach all feels bound up.
*  I feel this really groggy.
*  I don't like this.
*  To me, it was very easy to say pain is better than taking even one more of these pills.
*  Meanwhile, I've treated people who say the first time I had an opioid,
*  it was like a hole that had been in my heart my whole life, filled up for the first time.
*  Now, both those experiences are real.
*  You cannot attribute them to, well, Keith must be a real solid and moral person.
*  And that's an immoral person.
*  Or Keith must have made good choices and that person made bad choices.
*  Because we had no learning history at all.
*  It was just the kismet of genetics that drugs feel differently to different people from the
*  very first time, not just learning history.
*  And so I find it very easy to be sympathetic to someone who's addicted to opioids.
*  Because I think the reason I'm not going to do that is not because I'm a better person.
*  It's because they just don't feel good to me.
*  And to you, they felt fantastic.
*  So you were willing to keep on using them.
*  It's not just that I find it easy to be sympathetic,
*  but I find it hard to know how to think about it.
*  Because to be blunt, I've had very positive personal experiences with certain drugs.
*  And at the same time, I'm somebody who is extremely non-addictive in this area of my life.
*  I have never wanted more puffs on a cigarette than I had.
*  I've never smoked a cigarette and been like, I need another one.
*  Obviously, other people I knew when I was in college, that was not how that went for them.
*  There is something here where, on the one hand, I worry that a fair amount of the discourse around drugs
*  comes from people for whom maybe it actually is positive for them.
*  There are people who have real positive relationships with different kinds of substances, both legal and illegal.
*  Adderall can be amazing for somebody with ADHD.
*  And it can be very destructive for somebody who ends up using it recreationally.
*  I mean, you're talking about methamphetamines, and it's not all that different.
*  And it becomes, I think, almost philosophically hard to know how to think about these substances.
*  They really can range, right?
*  How to think about something where, for some people, it can be a very good part of their life,
*  either pleasurable or even very profound.
*  For other people, it can be a complete disaster that will actually ruin their life.
*  And who are you making policy for and how?
*  It feels like something that this conversation gets caught on a lot.
*  I agree, yeah, because drugs aren't good and drugs aren't bad.
*  They're good and bad.
*  And sometimes I envy colleagues who work in areas like cholera prevention.
*  If there's a cholera outbreak and you get rid of it, you're a hero.
*  Everybody loves you.
*  Nobody says, but I was having a party.
*  I need a little cholera.
*  Can't you keep a little cholera for special occasions?
*  It's like, no, everyone just hates cholera.
*  Drugs are absolutely not like that.
*  People have great experiences with drugs.
*  I drink wine, by the way.
*  That's a drug.
*  Or ethanol is a drug.
*  So we can't resolve it that simply.
*  And so we have to get into these questions of, well, when is it good and when is it bad?
*  And for whom is it good and for whom is it bad?
*  And then there's a question that is, to me, a philosophical question, in fact,
*  religions grapple with, which is, should I give something up for the benefit of others?
*  Perhaps I can use fentanyl freely and enjoy it.
*  But should I still say it shouldn't be in the recreational market?
*  Because I'm aware enough of my fellow people would find it life-ruining.
*  And so the moral thing is to do for me to give it up so the sense that all of us can
*  live together in a spirit of common humanity.
*  And there's always going to be tougher discussions, you know, things that are good and bad,
*  versus things that are just clearly good and we should just embrace them and clearly bad
*  and just reject them.
*  I wonder about this with the rollout of legal cannabis across a lot of the country.
*  So this is something that I occasionally take.
*  I'll sometimes have a five milligram edible to help me sleep or to relax at the end of the night.
*  It isn't something I want all that often.
*  And when I go into these stores and I look in them and I see the way they're popping up in
*  New York, the way they popped up in California, it's pretty clear this market is not catering to
*  me. And I think a lot about something that, as you mentioned, our mutual late friend, Mark
*  Kleinman, who was one of the great drug researchers and crime researchers used to say to me, which is
*  that alcohol companies do not make their money on people who drink a beer to a week.
*  They make their money on people who drink a case.
*  And when I go into these stores, what I see are like the rise of super high potency products
*  that I wouldn't touch. And clearly the money is being made, given how many of the stores there are
*  on people taking a lot more than I am a lot more often.
*  When you look at what is going on with legal cannabis, how do you feel about it?
*  So start at the question of should we ever throw people in a cell for cannabis? Oh,
*  so that was a terrible idea. So let's take that off the table and just say, if we're going to have
*  legal industry, have we regulated it well? And I think it's absolutely clear we have not.
*  This is something we're generally, I'd say, bad at relative to other countries of constraining
*  profit when the profit damages public health. And so we have an industry with hardly any constraints
*  on their products, not a very good record with even labeling their products accurately,
*  very poor enforcement of even keeping the legal regime in place. And the pot shops in New York
*  are a good example of that. A huge number of them are unlicensed and just doing whatever they want
*  and they're being allowed to do that. So I think we've done a really bad job with cannabis
*  and in part driven by this phenomenon of not being willing to admit that cannabis isn't good
*  or bad, but it is both. And so when Mark Kleiman and I worked with Washington State,
*  who was one of the first states to legalize, and we said, you know, you still need to have some
*  enforcement to make a licensing system work. I remember people literally either laughing
*  or getting angered and saying, you know, the war on drugs is over, no more enforcement ever.
*  It's like, actually, no, why would you have a license and do the right thing and not hire
*  minors? And why would you be short a card? And why would you sell clean and safe products?
*  Well, you do that because you get a market advantage in a licensed market. And so if we
*  just allow anybody to do anything, well, then there's really no point in getting a license,
*  no point in paying your taxes, no point in being a good citizen, no point not in hawking dangerous
*  products. And that's the situation that we have. And we're going to be really sorry for it.
*  The distribution of consumption is also really important to think about is it's not quite half,
*  but you know, it's certainly a plurality of cannabis users today are using it every single day.
*  Usually a high strength product. Wow, really? Almost half?
*  Yeah, it's about 40% are daily or near daily users. And so that's where the money is, you know,
*  if you're running an industry and so you want to produce cheap high strength product that that
*  population will use and use and use and use. And I just think we're really going to we're really
*  going to regret that. My friends over at Search Engine, which is a great podcast, just did this
*  two part series on the New York cannabis market. And I had not really understood that while New
*  York is now completely full of what appeared to me to be legal cannabis stores, virtually none of
*  them are legal cannabis stores, there's a very small number of legal ones, and then a huge number
*  of illegal ones. And you might say, well, how are there all these illegal stores? And the answer is
*  that nobody wants to send the police to bust people for cannabis. And so much of the theory
*  of legalization, as I understood it for years, was that we will legalize and then be able to
*  regulate the market. But if what we've done is legalized, but we're not willing to use law
*  enforcement, and so we cannot regulate the market, that's actually a dramatically different policy
*  equilibrium than I feel like I was promised. Yeah, the experience you're having, I think people
*  have had across a lot of drug policy is expecting one thing and then getting another and sort of
*  underestimating the ideological commitments of the people who designed it. So there are people who
*  say, we're going to have this legal market and we'll get rid of the illegal sellers and all that.
*  But that isn't what necessarily they wanted. They may have just thought, look, this should not be
*  restricted at all. And you should just be able to deal with it and sell it and have sort of a
*  classic sort of libertarian understanding of it, as opposed to a more progressive understanding of
*  what we expect from industries. And this problem is replicated all over the country.
*  There's also something that's happened in policing, which is there's always more to do
*  for police than they have to do. So they're not super interested in getting involved, even with
*  some of the massive problems we have, for example, here in California, we have huge illicit grows.
*  Some of them staffed by people who have literally been human trafficked, but it hasn't really risen
*  up as an enforcement priority because, you know, cannabis, you know, we don't do that anymore.
*  You've said this about cannabis and I found it really striking, quote,
*  the newly legal industry looks a lot like the tobacco industry, an under regulated,
*  under taxed, politically connected, white dominated corporate entity that generates
*  its profits mainly by addicting lower income people to a drug. 85% of Colorado's cannabis,
*  for example, is consumed by people who did not graduate from college. Can you say a bit more
*  about that socioeconomic breakdown? Yeah. So I think that, you know, in sort of middle
*  upper class society, that figure is really shocking and sort of ideas. Oh, you know, cannabis user is
*  someone like you, someone who has a good job, went to college and maybe uses occasionally.
*  And no, like, you know, I say, if you want to think of the typical user, think of somebody who
*  works in a gas station who gets high on all their breaks. That's much more of the socio-demographic
*  breakdown of it. And by the way, that's what you see with tobacco as well. I, in my, you know,
*  professional middle class life, it is so rare for me to see somebody smoking a cigarette.
*  But if you go into a poor neighborhood, there's still a lot of people who smoke
*  cigarettes. And so we've won the war in smoking, I guess, if we're middle class and well off,
*  but, you know, it's far less the case as you move into people who have much more challenging lives.
*  And this comes back to the point that you raised, and I think is a really important one, is that
*  since that professional class makes the policies, it's really important for them to remember that
*  their lives are different than the people whose lives will be most profoundly affected by those
*  policies. One thing that a lot of drugs, cannabis being one of them, do is allow you to escape from
*  a life that doesn't feel good to you. You know, if I had a job that bored the hell out of me,
*  it might be more appealing to use something like cannabis more often. I really like my job,
*  and I definitely cannot do it high, so I don't. But there is a, there's both a question of
*  how does this affect you as a person, but also how much might you want it, need it, need the escape?
*  Dr. Michael O'Hara I think this is a, you know, gets down to one of the most important questions
*  to ask, which is why don't more people use drugs? You know, people use that, why does anybody use
*  drugs? It's like, well, do you ask me why anybody has sex? That's a really strange question. It
*  feels good. We don't need an explanation why people use them. It's actually far more interesting to
*  think, why aren't we all using them? Why aren't you and I using drugs right now? And big reasons
*  why are, well, we have other rewards in our lives, and we have a lot of other stuff that we want to
*  do that is rewarding. So in the absence of those things, the why not question, the answer seems to
*  be, well, I can't think of a reason why not. I might as well. Well, you won't live as long. Well,
*  I don't expect to live that long. You won't do well in your brilliant career. I don't have a
*  brilliant career. You won't enjoy your fabulous house. I don't have a fabulous house. And that's,
*  you know, a reason I think it's easy or should be easy to have some sympathy. Like we all don't have
*  the same set of rewards to choose from rewards. Any neuroscientist would tell you are judged
*  relative to each other. You know, we don't just make judgments over good, bad. We do a lot of this
*  is better than that. So as you pull rewards out of an environment, yeah, drugs become relatively
*  more appealing. It feels to me across this conversation that we're talking about two
*  eras. It didn't really work. I think a lot of people are worried about just a kind of pendulum
*  swinging between extremes. I'm curious if to you, there is a synthesis out there either in a place
*  or in a theory that feels like it balances these different realities that the people will use drugs.
*  They are good for some people and terrible for others that we don't want to be throwing adults
*  constantly into jail because they did something with their own bodies. We don't want tons of
*  people to get addicted because we decided not to throw anybody into like, is there something that
*  feels to you like it strikes a balance here? So years ago when I worked for President Obama,
*  we cited Washington's example because they had taken a couple hundred million dollars
*  spent it on mental health and substance use treatment and showed within 12 months, they'd
*  actually made all their money back because of less crime, because of less disability, because of less
*  trips to the emergency room. And importantly, they had gathered the data to show that. And that was
*  one of the things we used when the Affordable Care Act was being done to explain why covering
*  substance use in that package would be a good deal for the taxpayer in addition to, of course,
*  being a good deal to any person who had that problem. There's also certain issues where
*  people with very different views and feelings about drugs can agree. So I've been working with
*  a lot of people around the country on building Medicaid into the correctional system. Starting
*  in California, I was pushed by a fabulous assembly member named Marie Waldron. We turn Medicaid on
*  before people leave. And that gets them on to be on some type of medication. And that can pull
*  people together because it makes it far less likely for them to die of an overdose or to have other
*  health problems. And it also makes them much less likely to commit crimes. And so you can get people
*  are like, well, I'm not very sympathetic. I don't want to spend money on the health of some drug
*  user, but you know, if it makes them less likely to commit more crime, I like that. And other people
*  say, well, this is a health matter. And think, well, then they like it too. And that approach,
*  which now multiple states been approved for and the Biden administration CMS has said, you can all
*  have this Medicaid waiver and don't know the current number. I think it's about 14, 15 other
*  states are applying. And this example of something where you don't necessarily have to resolve all
*  the disagreements, but you can find a policy that maximizes multiple outcomes that a broad section of
*  people care about. Something I've seen you talk about and write about is this idea that
*  the way the policing should work here is it should be very, very predictable, very certain,
*  like you will get picked up and very modest, right? It's sort of almost like it operates as
*  a constant annoyance. You end up in jail for 24 hours and are let loose. And there was some evidence
*  that that definitely did decrease repeat offending, not among everybody, but among enough people to
*  really matter in the study. Do you still think that's a good idea? Absolutely. You know, it's a good
*  principle for enforcement and for deterrence to have it be predictable, responsive and fair.
*  There's been a lot of success with a drink driving and alcohol through the program 24-7 sobriety,
*  which started in South Dakota and it's now spread to about 15, 20 states. And it's also now in other
*  countries, like it's all across England, all across Wales, where I was just last week actually working
*  on that, which is a model whereby people are sentenced after their second, third, fourth,
*  fifth alcohol-related arrests to not be allowed to drink. They aren't sent to jail. They aren't fine.
*  Their car isn't taken away, but their alcohol use is monitored literally every single day
*  with a swift and certain but modest consequences if they drink. And that program has reduced
*  incarceration. It has reduced crime. It has reduced domestic violence. And it strikes a good
*  balance between using the criminal justice system to protect and put some constraints on people,
*  but not in a way that ends up being carceral. And the place where we could really make a huge
*  impact on that in the United States is the million people we're already supervising and probation
*  and parole who have substance use problems. And, you know, we need to roll those out more broadly.
*  For example, Oregon's new policy mix, if implemented properly, which will be a challenge,
*  I think, could be a very good one. They do put pressure on people in this treatment,
*  but they say literally no one is going to be put into a prison in Oregon simply because they used
*  a drug. And now they're building up the other part you got to have, which is you have to have
*  the health system and the services that keep people alive while they use and then help them
*  get into recovery. That, I think, is a very appealing mix of things. We have a really hard time,
*  I think, in the US and lots of policy issues of realizing that it's not a series of on-off switches,
*  it's a series of dials and you can sort of adjust things and find sensible, nuanced approaches that
*  are more effective than what fits on a bumper sticker. And I feel like that's what my job is.
*  And people like me who do not have to take the great risk to stand up in front of people and say,
*  please vote for me. And then that means I have to explain something simply, it can't be any other
*  way. But are next to it and are very fortunate to have the time to sift through evidence in a
*  calm environment before they venture out with some suggestions about what we might do better.
*  I think that's a good place to end. So then, also final question,
*  what are three books that you'd recommend to the audience?
*  So there's so many good books written about in this area, it's hard to pick. So I decided to
*  prioritize personal relationship, starting with your late friend of mine, Mark Kleinman, who
*  wrote a book called Drugs and Drug Policy, what everyone needs to know, co-authored with
*  Jonathan Calkins and Angela Hawken. And it is exactly what the title promises. It's accessible.
*  It's something you can dip into and out of and answer any question you want. And I also point
*  to it as just a model of how academics in any area can write in such a fashion that a broad
*  audience can engage their work and learn from it. Second book I would suggest, again, from a friend
*  is someone I've known since she was a psychiatric resident and I was an assistant professor, and
*  that's Dr. Anna Lemke here at Stanford. And the book is called Doubleman Nation, which was a
*  deserved bestseller around the world. But that gives you much more of a human experience describing
*  what is it like to be addicted to not be able to stop doing something even though you know it's
*  destructive? How does it feel? How do you try to overcome it? And what is going on in that person
*  neurologically that makes it so hard? And the book also talks about just the seeking of reward and
*  a reward saturated society and how we all are chasing all these things, whether it's on our
*  cell phones or with drugs and so on. And then the last one, maybe a more eccentric choice,
*  but it's such a good book, is by Thomas De Quincey and it's called Confessions of an English Opium
*  Eater. So De Quincey was a hangers-on of the romantic poet set about 200 years ago in England,
*  and he wrote at the time a very scandalous account, but of course also scandalous things
*  in Britain are often very popular things, so it became a bestseller, about his experience of
*  long-time opium use. And he talks about the pains of opium and the pleasures of opium,
*  and a bit about how it affects social relationships, how it affects human psychology.
*  And what I like about it is first off, it has a wonderfully florid, over-the-top poetic style.
*  And the other thing is almost everything you and I have talked about today is touched on in that
*  book. And that shows that while we do learn things and we go forward with science, with policy,
*  it is also true that the human relationship with drugs has had the same benefits and challenges in
*  it for time immemorial. And so that's a reminder of that when you read a book written that long ago
*  and can resonate with so much of what's going on today.
*  Keith Humphries, thank you very much.
