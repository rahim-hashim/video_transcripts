Video Description: Risk has been on my mind this year. For Democrats, the question of whether Joe Biden should drop out was really a question about risk – the risk of keeping him on the ticket versus the risk of the unknown. And it’s hard to think through those kinds of questions when you have incomplete information and so much you can’t predict. After all, few election models forecast that Kamala Harris would have the kind of momentum we’ve seen the last few weeks.

Nate Silver’s new book, “On the Edge: The Art of Risking Everything,” is all about thinking through risk, and the people who do it professionally, from gamblers to venture capitalists. (Silver is a poker player himself.) And so I wanted to talk to him about how that kind of thinking could help in our politics – and its limits.

We discuss how Harris is performing in Silver’s election model; what he means when he talks about “the village” and “the river”; what Silver observed profiling Peter Thiel and Sam Bankman-Fried, two notorious risk-takers, for the book; the trade-offs of Harris’s decision to choose Tim Walz over Josh Shapiro as a running mate; and more.

# Nate Silver on How Kamala Harris Changed the Odds
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM)
*  Nate Silver came to fame in American politics for election forecasting. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=0.0s)]
*  He built models that were pretty damn successful at predicting American politics. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3.84s)]
*  Nate Silver is the founder of 538.com, a polling website that correctly predicted the winner of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=9.36s)]
*  49 of the 50 states in the last presidential election. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=15.44s)]
*  Election oracle ESPN's Nate Silver. He predicted every state in the last presidential election. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=19.12s)]
*  And once again, Nate Silver completely nailed it. The guy's amazing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=26.4s)]
*  But before Silver was in politics, he was a poker player. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  And after getting into politics, he went back to being a poker player. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=37.36s)]
*  He's been running through poker championships and out there on tables. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=40.56s)]
*  Savage, savage bluff by Silver. Oh my God. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=44.64s)]
*  Partially because he's been writing a book about risk. Book is called On the Edge, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  the art of risking everything. And it applies the frameworks of, I'd say, the gambler, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=52.08s)]
*  maybe you could say the poker player, to politics, to AI, to venture capital. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  Nate, the way he thinks about politics, I find very useful. I find that he thinks more clearly [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=63.12s)]
*  about risk and probabilities than a lot of people do. And maybe more people should follow. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=67.6s)]
*  So I wanted to have him on to talk about how that thinking has guided him over the past year and how [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=72.8s)]
*  he's thinking about it in the election going forward. As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at ny times.com. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=78.8s)]
*  Nate Silver, welcome to the show. Thank you, Ezra. Happy to be here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=91.2s)]
*  Last I looked, your model has Harris winning the election at around 52%. It might be, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=94.64s)]
*  you know, mildly different today. But this has been an unusual election. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=99.92s)]
*  So how much stock do you put in your model right now? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=104.56s)]
*  I think the model is balancing these different factors pretty well. I mean, there are some [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=107.04s)]
*  things you could argue are favorable to Harris, one of which is that for the past few weeks, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  we've been in what the model thinks is supposed to be the convention bounce period for Republicans, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=113.68s)]
*  where typically you poll pretty well after your convention. There's the afterglow of the new [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  nomination and things like that. The afterglow of the VP pickoff into and Kamala Harris kind of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  stomped on Donald Trump's news cycle. So maybe that's maybe it's an overly favorable assumption [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=128.0s)]
*  There's also in polls what's known as nonpartisan response bias. So when voters get more enthusiastic, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=133.11999999999998s)]
*  you'd rather have that than not as a candidate. But it also means that they sometimes are more [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  likely to respond to polls. At the same time, her momentum has been pretty good, which usually I [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=142.48s)]
*  dismiss, but we don't really kind of know what the baseline is here, right? You know, Hillary [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=147.76s)]
*  Clinton, who was I think, kind of a terrible candidate, won the popular vote by two points. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  Is she a little bit better than Hillary Clinton? Probably, right. So can she win by three or four? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, if you win by three or four, then you win the electoral college and most in most instances, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=162.48s)]
*  I don't think many people expected. If you did, I'd like to know it. The turnaround in her numbers [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=165.84s)]
*  we have seen since she's become a presumptive nominee, she's gone to net favorables, which [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  I would not have bet a ton of money on at this speed, at least people were looking at a lot of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  data on Harris and assuming that that data was solid. That data was not solid. When a candidate [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=181.28s)]
*  is a hypothetical candidate, you have to treat that polling very carefully. People are, I think [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=188.24s)]
*  it's a weird thing to ask, you know, what if Gavin Newsom ran against Trump? It's not the same thing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=193.12s)]
*  as when you actually have the candidate in front of you and have the advertisements and have the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=198.08s)]
*  news articles and everything else to actually evaluate. I mean, I think this is like on the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  higher side for like a jump in favorables, but you know, she was amazingly well organized at getting [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=206.56s)]
*  the entire establishment behind her within like literally minutes of Biden announcing he was going [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=211.52s)]
*  to step down. And so that suggested that maybe she did have more support in the party than she [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=217.36s)]
*  led on. And also, you know, I don't, I think the Biden people may have been in somewhat bad faith, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  maybe not consciously, but I'm not sure they weren't trying to undermine her because the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=226.8s)]
*  obvious thing to do would be to have this qualified, if not always that politically adept, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  you know, much, much younger vice president take over for you when you're about to be 82. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=236.56s)]
*  But they gave her the border, they gave her voting rights, which is kind of the one major [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=240.88000000000002s)]
*  domestic policy area where they got very little done. So I don't think they gave her a very good [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=245.04s)]
*  hand to play. But meanwhile, she's getting a lot of reps and giving speeches and building connections [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=249.76s)]
*  and, and play the game really well. I have a lot of respect for that. Well, the key thing I think is [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  that Biden had a huge amount of influence over how the party viewed her in both directions. There was [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=258.96s)]
*  a long period, I would say, when the quiet signals out of Biden world were, this isn't going well. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=264.32s)]
*  And when there was pressure to push Biden off the ticket, the signals got louder. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=273.36s)]
*  Harris cannot do this. If you get rid of him, you're going to get her you're going to lose. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  But then the thing you saw happen is a moment Biden actually stepped aside [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=283.2s)]
*  and fully endorsed her. That was a signal so powerful that it functionally won the potential [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=287.52s)]
*  primary for Harris instantly, right? Nobody was going to go against Joe Biden in that moment. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=294.64s)]
*  So in both directions, Biden had and the team around him a lot of influence when implicitly, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=299.92s)]
*  Biden world told the Democratic Party, Harris can't do it, the Democratic Party believed them. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=306.4s)]
*  And then when explicitly Biden himself told the Democratic Party in the world, Harris could do it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=311.68s)]
*  The Democratic Party believed him. And by the way, from what I could tell it seems he was right. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=317.76s)]
*  And I don't blame Biden, I think, for things that happened earlier in the administration. That was a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=322.72s)]
*  lot of staff talking. And to be fair, it was based on some things. There were problems in her office, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=326.16s)]
*  there were reasons to be to be skeptical. But he and they had tremendous power. In a way, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=330.8s)]
*  this was not to me like a mini primary. This was a parliamentary process. Right? The party came [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=337.44s)]
*  together and chose a leader through endorsements from elected officials. Like that's functionally [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  what happened. Very British. It felt like very British trust kind of thing or something right? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=348.16s)]
*  Where there's a loss of confidence. Those are fascinating dynamics to study. But yeah, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=352.64s)]
*  it's interesting to kind of have like the inside view versus like the outside view a little bit. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=357.36s)]
*  And again, we talked about this in the book a little bit, but I come in a position where I'm [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=361.76s)]
*  more skeptical about the competence of people who work in politics. Right? Even if I like [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=366.48s)]
*  the candidates, they they endorse. Right? I mean, I plan to plan to vote for Kamala Harris. I would [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=371.12s)]
*  not have voted for Joe Biden, by the way. I think it was deeply irresponsible to nominate him and I [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=376.4s)]
*  would have voted libertarian or something. But I have a more skeptical view. And I think even the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=380.16s)]
*  rationales they state out loud are sometimes maybe the rationales they believe or not. But I think [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=384.24s)]
*  human behavior is pretty strategic when you understand people's incentives and kind of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  information set and things like that. And I think it was in Biden's narrow self-interest [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=395.36s)]
*  to make Harris look weaker. And I think that kind of plays a role at all sorts of subconscious [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=401.92s)]
*  margins in terms of how she was treated. Let's talk about that skepticism. You and I have known [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=406.64s)]
*  each other a long time. We're old school bloggers. And my read of you is that somewhat over the 2016 [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=410.64s)]
*  election, then specifically over the pandemic. Yeah. And your experience, I think, with online [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=419.36s)]
*  liberalism in the pandemic, you became much more disillusioned with the people who once felt to you [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=426.32s)]
*  like your group, your coalition, your tribe. There's been a kind of alienation for you. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=434.72s)]
*  Is that a fair read? Yeah, I'd say it's three things. Right. Number one, like the 2016 aftermath. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=440.64000000000004s)]
*  I thought a lot of the kind of liberal and centrist news media kind of were in denial about their own [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=447.6s)]
*  role in the but her email stuff. Right. And then picked scapegoats for Trump's victory that were [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=454.48s)]
*  not the real reasons that he won. Right. You know, Russian bot farms have approximately nothing to [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=461.28s)]
*  do with why Donald Trump won the 2016 election. And I think it was like and the Russia stuff in [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  general, I think, was treated with the order of magnitude more important than it probably [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  objectively had. Right. And like blaming Facebook and kind of the tech industry for that. You know, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=474.32s)]
*  but I thought that was irresponsible and also kind of the discussion over the polls in 2016, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=480.96s)]
*  where I think there was kind of some revisionist history where the polls actually showed a pretty [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=485.44s)]
*  close race. I mean, we had Trump with a 30 percent chance and it was kind of the conventional wisdom [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=490.24s)]
*  that that assumed that he was dead in the water. Right. So the ability to kind of conveniently [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=493.68s)]
*  lie a little bit or kind of manipulate facts and spin facts. I mean, that was that was part one. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=501.04s)]
*  Part two was the pandemic. Absolutely. And, you know, orange man bad, I think, was often the reason [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=507.04s)]
*  that people believed a lot of what they believed, because in some ways, the move to shut down society [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=512.96s)]
*  in some ways kind of went against the values of traditional liberalism. Right. There's a transfer [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=519.28s)]
*  of welfare from younger people and people who are not able to work from home to wealthy suburbanites [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  and older people who you're protecting their health, but you're undermining the education of, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=532.0s)]
*  you know, millions and millions and millions of school kids around the country. And essential [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  workers are still putting themselves at risk that you deem unacceptable for people who are, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  you know, able to work with laptops to take. So I thought it was very self-serving and I thought [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=544.32s)]
*  kind of expertise was co-opted and corrupted by political partisans. Right. And then third, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=549.52s)]
*  which was the Biden stuff. Well, it seemed to me it happened for you before the Biden stuff. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=556.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, and you were crosswise with a lot of liberals on Twitter. I mean, I came back to [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=561.36s)]
*  Twitter for three weeks during the height of Biden mania to try to be sort of in touch with [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=567.44s)]
*  that sentiment and mostly stay away from it. But Twitter is a place that groups that exist outside [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=571.92s)]
*  the online hot house purify inside the online hot house. So there's the public health community [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=581.36s)]
*  sort of outside Twitter, and then there's how it acts inside Twitter, political scientists outside [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=587.8399999999999s)]
*  Twitter, and then inside Twitter, Republicans outside Twitter, then inside Twitter. And my sense [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=591.52s)]
*  was that you ended up in a lot of fights with liberals who had a much lower risk tolerance than [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=596.8s)]
*  you did. And between that and what was, I believe, unfair criticism of the 2016 model, which got the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=604.4799999999999s)]
*  election much more right than most did, that it's sort of you began to see habits of you call it the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=611.92s)]
*  village. The village is your sort of term for. Yeah. And that's been a term that's been used by [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  other. But the village is like basically basically media, politics, government, progress, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=623.76s)]
*  establishment, establishment, the New York Times, Harvard University, the regime. Yeah. A Democratic [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=630.4s)]
*  White House, maybe not a Republican White House, but that's a more complicated kind of education. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=635.28s)]
*  Maybe a different Republican White House. Yeah. Right. George W. Bush was part of the village. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=638.24s)]
*  Absolutely. Maybe Donald Trump wasn't. Absolutely. I think it's you've also called it sort of the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=642.08s)]
*  indigo blob in different ways that you began to see it as a kind of a set of aligned cognitive [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=646.24s)]
*  tendencies that you you disagreed with. What were they? So one of them is the failure to do what I [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=653.92s)]
*  call decoupling. It's not my term. Right. Decoupling is the act of separating an issue from the context. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=662.4s)]
*  So the example I give in the book is that if you're able to say I abhor the Chick-fil-A's [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=669.12s)]
*  CEO's position on gay marriage, I know it's changed now, but it was anti-gay marriage, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=676.72s)]
*  at least for some period of time. But they make a really delicious chicken sandwich. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=680.64s)]
*  Like that's decoupling. I abhor their treatment of chickens. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=684.48s)]
*  I have a strong direct take on Chick-fil-A. I don't like how they treat chickens. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=688.72s)]
*  OK. Or you can say or any separate out, you know, Michael Jackson, Woody Allen, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=692.08s)]
*  separate the art from the artist thing. Right. You know, that tendency goes against kind of the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=696.64s)]
*  tendency on the progressive left to care a lot about the identity of the speaker in terms of the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  racial or gender identity and in terms of their credentials. Right. This other world that I call [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=708.48s)]
*  the river, the kind of gambling risk taking world and all that matters is that you're right. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=713.1999999999999s)]
*  The river is your name for the community of people who are who think about risk [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=717.1999999999999s)]
*  roughly the way you do and are willing to make big bets, willing to accept loss. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=721.68s)]
*  Right. The river is your it's your world of gamblers at all levels of society. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=726.56s)]
*  Capital and lowercase g gambling. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=733.68s)]
*  Yeah. So hedge funds, venture capitalists. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=735.52s)]
*  Yeah. And then you get kind of the more groundwater stuff where it's like crypto [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=738.56s)]
*  and neem stocks and things like that. Doesn't matter who you are. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=741.76s)]
*  It matters that you're right and you're able to prove it or bet on it in some way. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=745.12s)]
*  And that's very against, I think, the kind of credentialism that you have within kind of the [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=748.24s)]
*  progressive democratic left, which I also call the end goal, blah, because it's a fusion of purple [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=752.88s)]
*  and blue. Right. There's not a clear separation between the nonpartisan centrist media and the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=758.4s)]
*  left leaning progressive media that's kind of rooting for Democrats. Right. Different parts of [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=764.9599999999999s)]
*  the New York Times have both those functions in place. And, you know, as someone who's kind of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=768.8s)]
*  more on the nonpartisan side, you know, even though, again, I would prefer to see Kamala [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=773.68s)]
*  Harris and Donald Trump, you know, I think people are exploiting the trust that institutions have [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=778.0s)]
*  earned for political gain. And particularly in the kind of pre-Elon pandemic era Twitter days, I mean, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=782.56s)]
*  the pylons were kind of insane and like and like 98 percent of people don't have the tolerance for [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=789.04s)]
*  that. But but I don't really care because these people are not my friends. Right. And I have like [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=794.2399999999999s)]
*  a good life outside of Twitter. And because, you know, the stomachs and even like if you run a [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=798.56s)]
*  newsletter, being a little polarizing is is OK. Right. If I have 10 random people yelling at me [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=802.8s)]
*  on Twitter and 10 people sign up to be paid subscribers to Silver Bulletin, then I come out [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=808.0799999999999s)]
*  like way ahead in that deal. And so I think I couldn't do my job without running afoul of these [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=812.24s)]
*  this group of people. Let me ask you about the definition of decoupling there, because I think [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=818.16s)]
*  decoupling is interesting. And I found the examples you pick also interesting, but contestable. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=821.5999999999999s)]
*  So in the Chick-fil-A example, I'm like a between a vegetarian and a vegan these days. So I got my [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=827.7600000000001s)]
*  own issues with Chick-fil-A, but was not a believer necessarily in boycotting it if you didn't have my [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=833.0400000000001s)]
*  issues. But I understood it as more like a boycott that theory. Right. You don't want to give money [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=838.72s)]
*  to something that's going to work against your interests. The question of decoupling art and [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=843.0400000000001s)]
*  artist, which I'm more on the side of decoupling, but also has a dimension of those both strike me [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=846.5600000000001s)]
*  as versions of activism, right? What you want to do, what people who hold those positions are trying [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=853.92s)]
*  to do is affect change in the world by applying consequences to beliefs. And maybe you don't want [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=858.88s)]
*  that right. Or you don't agree that the beliefs they are trying to affect should have those [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=864.88s)]
*  consequences on them. But it's kind of different than the idea of things that are being pressed [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=870.0799999999999s)]
*  together that don't go together. Right. I think an interesting sort of decoupling issue that happened [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=875.52s)]
*  during the pandemic was the same public health voices who were saying, who were at one point saying [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=880.72s)]
*  you had to be so careful even outside oftentimes were then pro joining the George Floyd protests, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=888.0s)]
*  which a lot of people found very upsetting. What people were looking to the public health world for [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=894.08s)]
*  right then was not their views on protests, but their views on distancing. And that felt like it [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=900.48s)]
*  coupled things in a way that undermine one to achieve another. And they framed it in like, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=906.56s)]
*  oh, this is good for public health reasons. Right. If they had said, look, I'm a big believer in racial [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=912.0799999999999s)]
*  equity. There is a little bit of risk here, but outside where I'm asked, I'm probably not a huge [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=916.88s)]
*  problem. I mean, that would be honest, right. Which ended up being true too. Yeah. But instead it was [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=922.2399999999999s)]
*  like in the name of public health, right. I think people don't do enough thinking about thinking, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=926.4799999999999s)]
*  right. And don't read enough of like the literature on like cognitive biases. I mean, ironically, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=932.16s)]
*  this is kind of like the expert literature on like how powerful the human mind is at confirmation [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=936.4s)]
*  bias and how powerful a drug political partisanship is and how smart people are maybe better [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=941.1999999999999s)]
*  rationalizers and in certain respects. I mean, a lot of irrational traits are like rational on some [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=948.9599999999999s)]
*  halfway approximate different version of the universe. You know what I mean? My first book [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=954.64s)]
*  was on polarization. And what I understand he's doing in the book in part is making an interesting [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=957.76s)]
*  cut in society between people with different forms of both risk tolerance and thinking about [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=962.32s)]
*  risk. And you read something that caught my eye where you say quote, COVID made those risk [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=968.96s)]
*  preferences public, worn on our proverbial sleeves and our literal faces. And you go on to say, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=975.0400000000001s)]
*  quote, people are becoming more bifurcated in their risk tolerance. And this affects everything [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=981.0400000000001s)]
*  from who we hang out with to how we vote. Tell me about both sides of that, the way that it made [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=986.5600000000001s)]
*  risk tolerance visible, but then your view that since then risk tolerance becoming a deeper [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=992.32s)]
*  cleavage in society. I mean, on the one hand, there are lots of signs that risk tolerance is [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=996.88s)]
*  going down, right? Among young people in particular, they're smoking less, drinking less, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1002.08s)]
*  doing fewer drugs, having less sex, a different type of risk tolerance, they are less willing to [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1008.24s)]
*  defend free speech norms if it potentially would cause injury to someone, right? That's kind of a, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1013.6s)]
*  free speech is kind of a pro risk kind of take in some ways, because speech can cause effects, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  of course. On the other hand, you have this boom and bust and various booms and busts in crypto, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1024.24s)]
*  you have Las Vegas bringing in record revenue, you have record revenue in sports betting and [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1029.3600000000001s)]
*  things like that. You have the CEO of OpenAI saying, yeah, this might destroy the universe, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1034.08s)]
*  but it's worth it. It's a gamble to take, right? You have FTX and all this stuff. And so, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1039.6s)]
*  you know, and like, the first trip I made after COVID was to a casino in Florida, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1043.92s)]
*  which is every bit of the shit show that you think it might be in the tournament drew record [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1047.6000000000001s)]
*  numbers of poker players. And so it just seems to me like we are in a world now where institutions [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1050.56s)]
*  are less trusted. And some people respond to that by saying, okay, I make my own rules now, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1057.04s)]
*  and this is great. And I have lots of agency. And some respond by kind of withdrawing into [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1061.52s)]
*  an online world or maybe kind of clinging on to beliefs and experts that have lost their [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1067.44s)]
*  credibility and or just by becoming more risk givers. Right. I mean, I think the pandemic also [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1072.16s)]
*  revealed that there's like a lot of differences in introversion versus extroversion, right? I [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1075.6s)]
*  just can't deal with being cooped up inside all day, right? This doesn't work for me at all. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1081.12s)]
*  But I think some people kind of secretly like the idea that like, okay, there's no more FOMO, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1086.0s)]
*  I can kind of be cozy all day. And that's fine. There's, you know, differences in [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1090.32s)]
*  desire for human companionship and things like that, too. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1095.2s)]
*  Let's talk about a couple of those people. One of the things that's kind of fun about the book is [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1098.64s)]
*  you spend time with people whose approach to risk you find sophisticated and interesting. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1103.12s)]
*  One of them is Peter Thiel. What were your impressions of Peter Thiel? What did you learn [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1109.92s)]
*  spending time with him? The first impression is that he's a weird dude. I interviewed him by [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1114.08s)]
*  phone. And the first question I asked him, he took half an hour to answer. So he's very thoughtful. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1121.6s)]
*  And the question was what I thought was kind of a softball question. It's like if you ran the world [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1127.3600000000001s)]
*  a thousand times or 10,000 times, how often do you think you'd wind up in a situation like the one [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1131.3600000000001s)]
*  that you're in? And it was kind of like a nerdy way to ask, do you think you got lucky? Which in [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1135.76s)]
*  Thiel's case is interesting. I mean, there's an anecdote in the book about this famous or infamous [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1140.5600000000002s)]
*  car trip he took with Elon Musk. They were going to pitch Michael Moritz at Sequoia Capital. And [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1144.24s)]
*  Elon had a new McLaren F1 and was going way too fast and spun out of control in the middle of [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1150.0800000000002s)]
*  Sand Hill Road or whatever. And they totaled the car. They could easily have been killed. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1157.04s)]
*  And instead, they actually hitchhiked to this meeting and save what was then called [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1160.96s)]
*  Cofinity. It was like the future of the PayPal. And so this twist of fate, twist of good fortune, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1165.6s)]
*  kind of helped Peter Thiel out. But most people understand. Wait, how did it help him out? I mean, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1170.3999999999999s)]
*  he didn't die. Well, he didn't die. So he avoided dying, I guess I'd say. So probably the expectation [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1176.32s)]
*  was not that he'd die. But the point is still that you can easily have a world in which Elon [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1181.68s)]
*  Musk and Peter Thiel are not a part of it if there's a car going the wrong way on the other side of [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1186.96s)]
*  the road. So most people, when you ask that question, I ask Mark Cuban, for example, they'll [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1190.4s)]
*  give the politically correct response, which is, oh, of course, I've been very lucky and I'm a [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1195.3600000000001s)]
*  talented person. But of course, it's a one in a million thing. And Thiel objected to the question. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1199.2s)]
*  Well, if it's predetermined, then the odds are 100%. And if the world's not predetermined, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1205.76s)]
*  then the odds are probably approximately zero. But it doesn't really make sense. Like, how can [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1211.28s)]
*  you perturb the world by exactly this amount? And but you know, I think he kind of believes in like, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1215.2s)]
*  in predestiny, a little bit. And as a spiritual thing, or as a matter of classical physics, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1220.08s)]
*  is a good book by, I think Max Chaffkin was a journalist or Chaffkin and I say his last name [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1226.32s)]
*  about Peter Thiel called the contrarian, which is convincing that Thiel is like actually [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1231.36s)]
*  quite conservative, more than libertarian, and probably quite religious. But I also think that [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1236.0s)]
*  if you kind of like, are one of these people that I mean, just the amounts of wealth, and success, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1241.76s)]
*  and power that Silicon Valley has, right? I do think some of these people kind of pinch themselves [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1246.56s)]
*  and wonder, and wonder if they have been one of the chosen ones, in some ways, or been blessed in [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1251.52s)]
*  some ways, or maybe the nerdy version of I think they're living in a simulation of some kind, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1257.36s)]
*  like what odds would you give yourself that like that actually makes sense that you're the [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1262.4s)]
*  protagonist of the story? It must be must be kind of weird, right? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1265.6000000000001s)]
*  So I used to interview Thiel, not super regularly, but every so often, my impression of him, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1268.48s)]
*  which has been my impression of a lot of the, I would call them the ideologist VCs, which is not [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1274.8000000000002s)]
*  all VCs, but the ones who are heavily behind or out online sort of pushing a kind of what I would [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1281.52s)]
*  think of as like VC ideology that, you know, leans now right. Talking was always interesting, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1289.04s)]
*  because over the course of conversation, he would offer like 15 or 20 ideas, I would call them more [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1294.32s)]
*  thought experiments and analytical arguments, they were not empirically backed typically. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1301.36s)]
*  And you would leave and be like, 13 of those seem genuinely ridiculous to me. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1306.8s)]
*  Two of them might be very importantly, right? I'm not 100% sure which are the two, and which are the [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1313.04s)]
*  13. And Peter Thiel, I think is very, he is a sort of template of the VC mind. And a lot of VCs try [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1320.0s)]
*  to be him. And he's been very successful. I mean, he's a guy who's backed a number of very important [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1326.24s)]
*  companies, found a number of very important founders, right? He is able to do something there. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1330.48s)]
*  But it is oriented towards being right in important and counterintuitive ways, like [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1335.3600000000001s)]
*  three out of 20 times, and doesn't care about being wrong 17 out of 20 times. Whereas like, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1342.3200000000002s)]
*  if you think about media, media is oriented towards being like, right, 17 out of 20 times. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1347.92s)]
*  And the three that it gets wrong are going to be really big, because they're going to be correlated [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1355.44s)]
*  across the entire, you know, the entirety of like American institutions. But it's a very different [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1359.36s)]
*  way of thinking about risk. It's like, you want big payouts, not a high betting average. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1364.7199999999998s)]
*  And that's because this is core to the VC mindset, right? The two things that you hear [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1370.7199999999998s)]
*  from every VC, one is the importance of the longer time horizons, you're making investments [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1375.4399999999998s)]
*  that might not pay off for 10 or 15 years. But number two, even more important, is the asymmetric [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1379.12s)]
*  ability to bet on upside, right? They are all terrified, because they all had an experience [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1384.88s)]
*  early in their career, where Mark Zuckerberg walked through their door, or Larry Page or [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1389.2800000000002s)]
*  Sergey Brin walked through their door, right? And they didn't give them funding. And then they [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1394.24s)]
*  wound up missing on an investment that paid out at 100x or 1000x or 10,000x. And so if you can only [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1397.8400000000001s)]
*  lose one extra money, but you can make 1000x, if you have a successful company, then that changes [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1403.68s)]
*  your mindset about everything. And you want to avoid false negatives, you want to avoid missed [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1409.3600000000001s)]
*  opportunities. And I think there's a tendency for like, a certain type of smart person to [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1414.32s)]
*  to provoke to kind of troll a little bit. I mean, I think he's like that a little bit. And this is [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1420.08s)]
*  also partly the thing on Twitter, right? Like I kind of use Twitter sometimes as like a sketchpad, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1424.96s)]
*  a little bit, right? For kind of slightly irrelevant half-curl-ish ideas that might later [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1432.1599999999999s)]
*  turn into newsletter posts or something like that, or might be developed further and kind of probing [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1436.72s)]
*  around and kind of seeing what things land and what don't. Like kind of like a stand-up mic night, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1441.04s)]
*  right? At a comedy show or something. And like, I think that's how Twitter is meant to be used, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1446.6399999999999s)]
*  but like other people use it for like, enforcing consensus. And so, but we've already talked about [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1450.8799999999999s)]
*  Twitter. But yeah. Well, you can never talk about it enough, particularly with these people. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1456.1599999999999s)]
*  The one thing I will say on that, and I think this is true for virtually everybody I know who's been [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1461.84s)]
*  on that platform for a long period of time, is they will tell you that I have this persona on [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1468.4s)]
*  Twitter. Twitter's not real life. I mean, I used it to provoke, I'm having fun, I'm shitposting, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1473.44s)]
*  I'm trolling. And people over time, if they spend a lot of time there, become more like who they [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1478.4s)]
*  are there. That is true for Mark Andreessen, another person who you profile and talk to in the book. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1486.3200000000002s)]
*  It's true for lots of people in politics, I know. Ted Cruz has become his Twitter persona, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1492.16s)]
*  more than he once was. It happened in democratic politics, I think in 2020. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1498.24s)]
*  Different campaigns became more like their Twitter incarnations than like that person had been in [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1504.08s)]
*  politics before. There's a, and I think it has to do with social dynamics, because over time, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1508.96s)]
*  the people you get praise from become more persuasive and credible to you. The people who [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1514.8s)]
*  begin to hate you, you sort of repel from. People, I think, always think they can be playful in their [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1519.36s)]
*  social dynamics, but actually who you end up surrounding yourself, even online, you become [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1524.64s)]
*  them. It's very, very hard to maintain that kind of separation. I mean, clearly, you know, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1529.68s)]
*  Elon Musk maintained a stance for a while that, oh, I'm just kind of a libertarian moderate. Like, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1533.76s)]
*  no, he's kind of like a, you know, right-pilled. Yeah, and I'm just having fun. I'm posting funny [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1537.2s)]
*  things. He's his Twitter persona now. He spent some time with Sam Bankman Fried. Yeah. Tell [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1542.3200000000002s)]
*  me what you learned from him or learned about him. I think Sam is kind of insane. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1546.88s)]
*  And I'm not very sympathetic to him. I mean, I'm sympathetic in the sense that like, this is this [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1554.8000000000002s)]
*  very dramatic reversal of fortune where he's kind of literally emerging and on top of the whole world [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1558.64s)]
*  and like shooting commercials with Tom Brady and it kind of all collapses and he becomes very [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1563.92s)]
*  abandoned overnight. So he's kind of reaching out to a couple of journalists to have conversations [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1567.92s)]
*  because he has like, you know, basically no friends left in the Bahamas anymore. And like, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1572.4s)]
*  his parents are there and like two of his employees are there, but everyone else has like fled the [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1576.16s)]
*  island. Sam is somebody who has to be owned by the river, but you know, he's unabashedly a part [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1580.4s)]
*  of that world. I mean, he had his tentacles in every part of that world. He was active in [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1587.6000000000001s)]
*  democratic and actually under the radar Republican political donations, right? So he's trying to [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1591.92s)]
*  figure out how to get into sports betting legally and things like that. And so he is kind of [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1596.24s)]
*  everywhere. And of course, most of all with the effect of altruists in the kind of original plan [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1600.24s)]
*  for the book, there was like this awkward transition between the chapter on crypto and [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1604.96s)]
*  the chapter on effective altruism, right? And like, how do I kind of have a natural transition? And [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1608.88s)]
*  then SBF is very important in both worlds. And it's a very strange connection that somehow crypto [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1612.3200000000002s)]
*  profits are funding like these people who want to like, you know, cure malaria or something in [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1617.6000000000001s)]
*  Africa. But, you know, I think there are a couple of things. One is that I think people were overly [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1621.92s)]
*  impressed by SBF, partly because he was able to manipulate his self image, right? I mean, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1629.5200000000002s)]
*  he's like not the most, you know, conventionally normal guy, right? But like, he was very aware [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1634.96s)]
*  that founders, the founder algorithm, the VC algorithm is like, oh, we can't, you know, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1641.52s)]
*  weirdness is good for VCs, right? The fact that SBF would play video games and investor pitch [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1645.3600000000001s)]
*  meetings or things like that, right? Or dress down or have a fidget spinner. They're like, oh, you [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1651.8400000000001s)]
*  know, he's a little bit on the spectrum. And that's actually probably good for a founder because you [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1656.0s)]
*  want a single mind and devotion and he's a little weird, but you want variance, variance, variance. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1660.16s)]
*  Sleeps on a bean bag, right? There's a, there's a real mythos around him. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1664.24s)]
*  Right. Which is kind of carefully constructed. He's kind of inhabiting a character, which is [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1668.0s)]
*  inspired by some inner SBF and he's kind of playing that character and then kind of [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1671.44s)]
*  forgets what has ever inner core values at whatever they were might've been. But he is not [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1675.92s)]
*  a very competent manager of risk. He invested all this money in this democratic primary for a candidate [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1681.04s)]
*  named Carey Flynn in Oregon's, I forget which six or seventh district, maybe eighth district. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1686.48s)]
*  And the candidate had been ahead in the polls by 15 points and wound up losing by 15 points, right? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1691.44s)]
*  Because to spend $8 million in a congressional primary is kind of insane if you're not like the [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1695.68s)]
*  New York media market or something. So the candidate would go to people's houses and be like, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1702.0s)]
*  Hey, I'm Carey Flynn. I'm in a candidate for the Oregon primary. And they're like, oh, I have your [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1706.0s)]
*  literature. And like, bring out like a stack of like 20 flyers that SPS, you know, a super PAC [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1710.24s)]
*  had sent on behalf of Carey Flynn and made him look like a weird freak backed by this mysterious, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1716.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, crypto billionaire. So, yeah, I, he had a tendency, this is based on testimony from [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1721.12s)]
*  both in the court case and an interview with Tara McCauley, I think his name was his original [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1728.72s)]
*  co-founder at Alameda. He had the kind of often good initial instincts and like being a good [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1733.9199999999998s)]
*  estimator is an important skill in my world. But then we kind of double down on that a lot [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1740.0s)]
*  and rationalize things a lot. And there was also a bystander effect problem where so many people [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1746.08s)]
*  vouched for him. Oh, Sequoia Capital and all these Oxford philosophers, he's effective altruists, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1750.3999999999999s)]
*  and he's on stage with Bill Clinton or whatever, right? And he's invited to the Met Gala and Tom [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1755.84s)]
*  Brady is shooting commercials with him. So like, what could possibly be wrong with this guy? I mean, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1761.36s)]
*  maybe he seems a little bit weird to me, but all these other people are kind of in his corner. And [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1765.1999999999998s)]
*  like, but like no one was doing the due diligence. And he kind of figured out that like, despite, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1768.24s)]
*  there's a little contradiction in the river where on the one hand, we tend to think of ourselves as [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1772.64s)]
*  being contrarian. On the other hand, we're pretty big fans of markets, because we know that it's [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1778.0800000000002s)]
*  kind of hard to beat the Las Vegas point spread, or it's hard to beat the S&P 500 index funds or [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1782.64s)]
*  things like that. So like, well, the market judgment is that SBF is a credible actor. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1787.0400000000002s)]
*  And how would I trust my own judgment over the market judgment a little bit? And there was [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1791.76s)]
*  too much deference toward that and too much actually group think about SBF, because the [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1796.0800000000002s)]
*  problems were evident the whole way. I mean, he told Tyler Cowan that if he could flip a coin [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1800.3999999999999s)]
*  to double the amount of utility in the world, plus one epsilon or something, but there's a 50 50 [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1805.4399999999998s)]
*  chance of blowing the world up, that he would take the coin flip and repeatedly. And so you're [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1810.08s)]
*  actually getting two Earths, but you're risking a 49% chance of it all disappearing. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1814.0s)]
*  So and again, I feel compelled to say like, caveats here of like, you know, how do you really know [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1821.2s)]
*  that's what's happening, blah, blah, blah, whatever, but that aside, take the hypothetical, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1825.28s)]
*  pure hypothetical. Yeah, yeah. And then you keep on playing the game. So what's the chance we're [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1828.8s)]
*  left with anything? Don't I just St. Petersburg paradox you into non existence? Well, not [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1835.04s)]
*  necessarily maybe St. Petersburg paradox into an enormously valuable existence. That's the other [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1840.8799999999999s)]
*  option. I remember seeing that Tyler Cowan interview and thinking, that's nuts. But but I [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1846.3999999999999s)]
*  think it gets at a kind of nuts that there is a bias towards in the world you're describing. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1851.2s)]
*  There is an aesthetic around talking and probabilities, right? There's an ability [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1858.24s)]
*  to think in probabilities. And there's an aesthetic around probabilities, right? People [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1862.48s)]
*  attaching, I would often say almost random probabilities to things. I see this a lot in [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1866.6399999999999s)]
*  Silicon Valley. You know, people who I would call it like faux Bayesian reasoning, where they're [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1871.52s)]
*  given some probability, but they have no reason to base the probability, right? 50% of this. And it [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1878.32s)]
*  makes you sound much more precise. It makes you sound like you know what you're talking about. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  SPF was known for always talking in terms of expected value, which is very appealing to the [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1887.04s)]
*  kinds of people you're describing, maybe the kind of person even that you are. And people who know [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1893.9199999999998s)]
*  how to talk like that get through a lot of filters. Because you sort of assume if they're if they've [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1898.48s)]
*  converted everything into probabilities, and they're great at math, and you know, he worked at Jane [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1905.36s)]
*  Street. I worried about this a lot with effective altruists for a while, which is a group I have a [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1908.8799999999999s)]
*  lot more sympathy for than most people now have. But there can be this tendency, I think, to fetishize [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1913.28s)]
*  a certain form of discourse. It's like the first people in that form of discourse are doing [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1920.96s)]
*  something valuable. And then after that, I think it can become a kind of costume of sloppy thinking, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1924.6399999999999s)]
*  right? This worries me about models, too. I'm curious how you think about it, because I often [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1930.8799999999999s)]
*  find that people talk in terms of probabilities, but people hear them in terms of certainties, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1935.04s)]
*  that somehow talking in terms of probabilities makes people more willing to believe you without [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1940.08s)]
*  actually being skeptical or attaching a failure risk to you. Yeah, I mean, there's two things here. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1945.6799999999998s)]
*  One is just there is like a kind of jargon. I mean, in some ways, I like in, like being from [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1951.6799999999998s)]
*  the river to like being from like, the south of the United States or something, right? Where there's [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1957.12s)]
*  just a lot of shared cultural norms, and unspoken, discursive tendencies, right? It's just the way we [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1960.8799999999999s)]
*  communicate, I think, in the river. But also, like, it's really easy to build bad models, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1966.64s)]
*  even in narrow problems, like I want to forecast the NFL or something or build an election model. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1972.96s)]
*  It's easy to build bad models. And on these open ended problems, it's really easy to fall in love [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1978.88s)]
*  with the incomplete model of the world and then forget that, you know, what's a Kamala Harris [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1982.72s)]
*  coconut tree quote, like a model does not fall from a coconut tree, right? It exists in the context [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1988.48s)]
*  of all that came before it. So like a model is supposed to describe something in the real world. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1992.8s)]
*  And if you lose sight of the real world, and it fails to describe the real world, then it's the [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=1997.6s)]
*  model's fault and your fault for building the model and not the real world's fault. And, and, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2002.32s)]
*  and that's a lesson that people I think, have a lot of trouble learning. Bankman Fried is in prison. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2006.48s)]
*  Teal might in some ways be responsible for destroying the Republican ticket this year. I [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2013.2s)]
*  mean, in a close election, JD Vance now seems to have about as much negative value as we've seen [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2018.0s)]
*  from a recent vice president. I'm not saying Peter Teal is the only reason Vance got chosen [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2022.16s)]
*  for the ticket, but he is one of the key reasons Vance is in politics. He's before now you would [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2027.44s)]
*  have said JD Vance was Peter Teal's political bet that paid off best. And now it might be his [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2032.4s)]
*  political bet that pays off worst. You mentioned Bankman Fried's political donations, which were [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2038.88s)]
*  kind of disastrous in a direct way. Sometimes also ended up taking a lot of other people down [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2047.52s)]
*  over time. If these guys are so good at making bets or seem to be so good at making bets, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2051.44s)]
*  what are they missing in politics as somebody who straddles those worlds? What is not in their [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2058.64s)]
*  models? So both these groups, both the river and the village are groups of elites. And I think [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2064.16s)]
*  ironically, like both groups critiques of one another are kind of true, right? I mean, they [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2069.36s)]
*  kind of kind of can be epistemic trespassers, but they are not very data driven when it comes to [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2072.7200000000003s)]
*  politics. And part of it too is that if you're a VC and you're evaluating a lot of pitches and a [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2079.52s)]
*  lot of opportunities, you have kind of very quick twitch reflexes for saying, okay, something about [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2085.92s)]
*  this founder seems smart. Let's investigate further. Let's do an initial seed round of [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2091.36s)]
*  investing. But it's like thin slicing and not necessarily for this part of the river, the VC [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2094.88s)]
*  part of the river, not necessarily more profound analytical takes on things. And so you're [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2099.68s)]
*  surrounded by people that are inclined to agree with you, right? You kind of see enemies on the [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2105.36s)]
*  other side. He thought maybe that like people had some deeper intuitive sense in 2016 that something [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2109.76s)]
*  was wrong with Hillary Clinton, even though she was ahead in the polls. And to his credit, he did [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2114.56s)]
*  back Trump at a time when that seemed like a big risk to take, it seemed like it was probably going [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2119.44s)]
*  to be the wrong bet. And it seemed like he was losing a lot of credibility. And now it turns out [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2123.6s)]
*  that he was kind of ahead of the curve. You know, Peter, like Peter Thiel, people like Peter Thiel [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2127.44s)]
*  thought that the village had been discredited by 2016 and other things, right? You can't really trust [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2131.84s)]
*  the polls. And they said Trump would never do X, Y or Z. But no, I mean, these guys often are pretty [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2138.48s)]
*  dumb about politics, right? And like, you know, I it's the same, you know, the guys in the hedge fund [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2144.32s)]
*  poker game that I play sometimes for the guys are like, I think Gavin Newsom is going to replace [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2151.92s)]
*  Joe Biden on the ticket. And it's like, you actually were kind of right about part of this. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2156.7200000000003s)]
*  But like, why do you why Gavin Newsom? What is the evacuation with? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2159.84s)]
*  I heard so many versions of that. I was out of it. So crazy. Yeah. But, you know, it's funny, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2163.36s)]
*  I would say what they've often missed in Thiel's particular on this is how human beings react to [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2168.4s)]
*  different human beings. So JD Vance, for instance, wildly underperforms in the Ohio Senate race. I [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2175.28s)]
*  mean, you know, and Vance's problem right now, he's pushed onto the ticket by as best we can tell [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2180.88s)]
*  people like Steve Bannon, Donald Trump Jr., Tucker Carlson, Elon Musk. So the very online, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2186.24s)]
*  very reactionary pill, the people around Trump. And what is missed about him is he's kind of [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2192.0s)]
*  off putting he doesn't talk to other people in a way they would like to be spoken to. He's able to [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2198.9599999999996s)]
*  make even popular ideas like a child tax credit sound completely bizarre when he talks about them [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2203.4399999999996s)]
*  in terms of punishing childless adults, that there is something here, I think, when people look at [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2208.8799999999997s)]
*  the world. And I've seen this in a lot of different dimensions of these kinds of folks. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2214.32s)]
*  When they look at the world too much in numbers, the intangibles begin to dissolve for them. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2219.76s)]
*  Although I think some of these tangibles aren't so intangible, right? Where, you know, yeah, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2226.4s)]
*  you can look at JD Vance's margins in Ohio, you can look at historically candidates who don't have [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2230.7200000000003s)]
*  experience getting elected to some lower office and then ascending the ranks underperform. It's [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2235.44s)]
*  been a factor in our congressional midterm models for years, for example. But look, in some ways, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2240.8s)]
*  I mean, these VCs are obviously incredibly deeply flawed people, right? And so like, why do they [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2246.5600000000004s)]
*  succeed despite that? I think because the idea of having a longer time horizon, number one, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2252.0800000000004s)]
*  and being willing to make these plus expected value, positive expected value, high risk, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2257.84s)]
*  but very, very, very high upside bets and gathering a portfolio of them repeatedly and making [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2263.28s)]
*  Monethy's bets that you effectively do hedge your risk, right? Like those two ideas are so good [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2267.52s)]
*  that it makes up for the fact these guys often have terrible judgment and are kind of vainglorious [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2273.04s)]
*  assholes, half of them, right? They're interesting people too. I mean, they're very interesting. I [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2276.64s)]
*  think, and they, I'm happy that the book is able to present, I think, a complete journalistic portrait [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2280.0s)]
*  of some of them, but they have lots and lots of flaws. And it's made up for by the fact that this [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2285.28s)]
*  is kind of a magic formula for, for making money. Let me get us back to the election. So we mentioned [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2289.84s)]
*  before Harris's approval ratings have gone from significantly underwater to net favorable very, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2295.84s)]
*  very fast. She's now leading in head to head polls. More than that, there's a real deep, whatever [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2301.76s)]
*  Republicans have convinced themselves to the contrary organic enthusiasm that has unleashed [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2308.96s)]
*  itself around her. She turns out to be very memeable in a way. I'm not sure people quite predicted. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2312.96s)]
*  I know most Democrats didn't predict this. I don't think you predicted it. So what was missed here? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2317.92s)]
*  What wasn't in the Harris model that should have been? Yeah, maybe you really can meme your way to [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2325.68s)]
*  victory. I, I don't know. I wouldn't necessarily have thought that. I mean, there's something about [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2331.36s)]
*  how it's off trend a little bit and it's kind of unexpected a little bit. And there's something [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2335.84s)]
*  about that. That I think I think people are ready for like a vibe shift, right? I think people [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2342.16s)]
*  in politics, um, neglect just how annoying the pedantic, dramatic, no fun tone of politics was [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2347.8399999999997s)]
*  and the having to be like serious all the time. And if the worst Republicans would say about [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2355.68s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Oh, she laughs a lot. Like maybe it kind of suits the mood a little bit after, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2359.68s)]
*  after so many years of doom and gloom. So maybe it was just spontaneous and lucky. I mean, it's [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2364.7999999999997s)]
*  also the case maybe, you know, when Kamala Harris was a candidate for the nomination in 2019, I had [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2370.48s)]
*  these tiers and the top tier was Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And the line was always, okay, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2376.24s)]
*  I got one of those right. And one of those about as wrong as possible, but she was seen as this [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2381.6s)]
*  rising up and coming political talent and maybe the combination of kind of misaligned strategy [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2385.68s)]
*  in 2019. And then, you know, not being marketed well by the white house. And we debated before [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2392.64s)]
*  what the reasons for that are. Maybe that was the underperformance and the rising star that people [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2399.2799999999997s)]
*  thought she was is kind of the real Kamala Harris after all. So Harris ended up choosing [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2403.92s)]
*  Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota as her VP pick. You made a case that it should have been [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2408.2400000000002s)]
*  Josh Shapiro. Tell me why. Pennsylvania, number one, there's about a 4% chance that in our model [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2412.4s)]
*  that Harris will lose the election because of Pennsylvania, right? Where she wins the other [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2421.12s)]
*  Midwestern swing states, but she's 19 votes or fewer electoral votes fewer because of Pennsylvania. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2425.6s)]
*  And if you're a probabilist and like a 4% chance because campaigns often don't make a difference, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2431.44s)]
*  right? If we go into a recession in the third quarter, then Harris will probably lose through [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2435.68s)]
*  no fault of her own. Right. But in the world where campaign strategy can make a difference, then [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2440.8s)]
*  the VP being from Pennsylvania is, is a reasonably big upgrade. And the fact that, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2445.28s)]
*  you know, he has demonstrated his popularity with this very diverse state. That's kind of [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2450.32s)]
*  a microcosm of the U.S. as a whole, right? Pennsylvania, you have, you know, you have [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2456.16s)]
*  the Northeast, you have the Midwest, and even you have a little bit of the South creeping in [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2459.36s)]
*  in the Appalachian part of the state. You have the suburbs, you have rural areas, and you have [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2462.2400000000002s)]
*  one of the biggest cities in the United States, right? You have a big African American vote. You [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2466.6400000000003s)]
*  have lots of famous colleges and things like that. You have everything there and he's 15 points above [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2470.4s)]
*  water approval wise. And, you know, that's pretty powerful information to work with. I happen to [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2475.44s)]
*  think that Tim Walz is an above average pick, you know, better than most, better than JD Vance, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2482.2400000000002s)]
*  not a particularly high bar, but better than a lot of the recent picks. I mean, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2487.52s)]
*  you know, I think he's kind of memeable as America's goofy dad kind of way. And he had [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2492.8s)]
*  a pretty moderate track record in Congress. And again, my premise is that generally speaking, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2498.48s)]
*  moderation wins a lot of people to screw with that. But I think the empirical evidence is strong [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2502.0s)]
*  there. You know, more progressive governance, of course, in Minnesota. But I think it was a [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2504.96s)]
*  somewhat risk averse decision. Now, if you read, why do you say that? I found this argument you've [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2510.88s)]
*  made very weird. So I think it's a very good chance. I was told people on the VP pick, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2514.8s)]
*  my head says Shapiro and my heart says Walz. I think that because I am a cautious person, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2519.52s)]
*  worried about if I were running for president, worried about losing Pennsylvania, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2525.52s)]
*  I would have found it very hard not to pick Shapiro because if you don't pick Shapiro, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2529.92s)]
*  and you end up in a we lost Pennsylvania scenario, everybody's going to blame you [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2533.84s)]
*  for blowing the decision that could have won you Pennsylvania, right in terms of the expected value, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2538.8s)]
*  both like on the front end and the back end. I understood walls as a choice on vibes, this sort [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2544.48s)]
*  of energy, this momentum she has created, he was sort of able to upend and remake all Democratic [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2549.44s)]
*  messaging in a single morning Joe appearance. There is some intangible charisma to walls that [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2554.48s)]
*  has made him like developed him overnight, this huge online fan base, that the cautious candidate, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2560.6400000000003s)]
*  the one listening to the consultants, the one reading Nate Silverpoles, that candidate goes [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2566.1600000000003s)]
*  with Shapiro. Walls is something else. Why did you say that that you understood walls is risk [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2570.48s)]
*  averse? Because I think they were worried about news cycles where the left got mad and or the [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2575.68s)]
*  Gaza issue was elevated and or you had protests at the convention in Chicago in a couple of weeks. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2582.8s)]
*  I think they were worried about about that and maybe kind of undermining what is clearly good [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2587.2s)]
*  vibes right now and maybe over rating. I mean, maybe maybe I just think it's a lower expected [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2592.16s)]
*  value decision. Right. What gives Kamala Harris a higher chance of winning the electoral college in [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2596.48s)]
*  in November? I think one of the questions I've been reflecting on because I often think about [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2601.44s)]
*  where do I disagree with writers I otherwise agree with? And I think I'm typically pretty aligned [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2605.36s)]
*  with you on a bunch of things or, you know, Iglesias or, you know, John Chait or some others. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2610.0s)]
*  But a lot of you have really gotten in to a view that I think takes a medium, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2615.6s)]
*  medium voter theorem almost too seriously, that it's like as if politics is unit dimensional [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2620.64s)]
*  and how close you are to ideologically the median voter is what decides elections, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2625.52s)]
*  which I do think moderation has an effect in. I mean, we see this in the political science research, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2630.72s)]
*  but it doesn't have a lot of room in that model for energy, for enthusiasm, for the mediation of [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2636.08s)]
*  politics, right? The thing that happens in between the candidate and the public for what is happening [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2644.16s)]
*  on social media, for what is happening on cable news. And you can often sort of back out explanations [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2648.24s)]
*  here and there. But I, for instance, think the sort of like in retrospect explanation that what [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2654.48s)]
*  led Obama to victory was careful moderation. One of the things he did was moderate on some issues [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2659.84s)]
*  like gay marriage. Another thing he did was unleash astonishing levels of enthusiasm in the [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2665.04s)]
*  electorate for reasons orthogonal in many ways to his policy positions. And so I'm curious how you [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2671.04s)]
*  think about that, because to me, the one of the questions Shapiro and Walz raised, Shapiro and [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2676.48s)]
*  Harris sort of are a lot like each other. I think they sort of come off as like the two smartest [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2682.16s)]
*  members of the law review, right? Which is like a kind of like not necessarily the visual you want. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2686.56s)]
*  Maybe it is, but that might not be. And that there is something here that is, I guess people [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2692.16s)]
*  call it vibes now. I feel like it's a little dismissive, but how you play out in earned media [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2698.48s)]
*  and social media, how much people want to talk about you, that feeling of enthusiasm. Like how [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2706.08s)]
*  do you think about that as somebody who builds models and handicaps politics? I mean, look, so [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2712.3199999999997s)]
*  if you're literally building a congressional model, there's a model that forecasts the vote [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2716.4s)]
*  based on fundamentals, which means not the polls, if you don't have polling, for example, based on [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2722.4s)]
*  whatever it is, you know, seven or eight factors. And one of those factors, if you're incumbent, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2726.4s)]
*  is how often do you vote with your party? And the more often you buck your party, actually, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2730.64s)]
*  the more often like Susan Collins or Joe Manchin, then you tend to overperform in your congressional [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2734.64s)]
*  race, right? Now that's but also one of eight factors, right? And even when you have all eight [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2739.04s)]
*  factors, there's still quite a bit of uncertainty in the race. So to me, it's like, this is something [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2744.96s)]
*  where really used to looking at larger data sets, you can come up with counter examples of John [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2750.4s)]
*  Tester is pretty progressive, actually, and somehow manages to get reelected in Montana, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2754.72s)]
*  with this kind of maybe Tim Walz, like folksy personality or something. So [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2761.2s)]
*  Jared Brown, sort of similar to that. Also pretty progressive. But like, if you take all the data [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2764.7999999999997s)]
*  from every congressional race since 1990, then it becomes clear in the aggregate, right? And I'd also [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2770.0s)]
*  say, like, if we could get progressives to the point where I know who we is in a sentence, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2774.24s)]
*  because I'm not sure identifies progressive liberal, but not progressive, I'd say, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2781.2799999999997s)]
*  if we could get them to the point where they said, yes, the median voter theorem is mostly true, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2785.3599999999997s)]
*  but sometimes that way by other factors. But yeah, so to get them to that point, instead of [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2791.2799999999997s)]
*  thinking, oh, you win elections by winning the base, right? I mean, that might have kind of [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2796.72s)]
*  narrowly been true. You're turning this round of progressives, because I'm asking it of you, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2800.3999999999996s)]
*  right? I agree that progressive should take the median voter theorem more seriously. But I'm asking [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2805.4399999999996s)]
*  you whether energy, enthusiasm, media, right? I just think attention in politics is under theorized. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2810.48s)]
*  I think if you look at Donald Trump, and you do a thing that I've seen people do and say, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2818.48s)]
*  look, he is more like the median voter on certain things like immigration, etc. Or at least he was [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2823.84s)]
*  perceived as more moderate than Hillary Clinton. And like, that's why he won. I think that is an [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2829.12s)]
*  under told story about Donald Trump that is somewhat true. I think that missing the showmanship of [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2833.2s)]
*  Donald Trump, the entertainment value, the energy he unlocks in people, like there's a reason that [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2838.8s)]
*  Trump had Dana White from the UFC and Hulk Hogan on his night of the RNC. So in 2020, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2846.4s)]
*  Joe Biden's view is that the election should be about Donald Trump. And Donald Trump's view is [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2853.52s)]
*  that the election should be about Donald Trump. But like that was a theory of attention they both [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2858.32s)]
*  agreed on. And it worked out for Joe Biden. In 2024, Joe Biden's view was the election should [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2861.04s)]
*  be about Donald Trump. Donald Trump's view is the election should probably be about Donald Trump. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2865.2000000000003s)]
*  And that was a bad theory of attention. Biden had no way of shifting a narrative that wasn't any [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2868.2400000000002s)]
*  good for him. And so I guess this is what I'm getting at that one thing that I worry about in [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2873.6s)]
*  some of this thinking among people I like is that attention is important. Candidates have different [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2879.92s)]
*  theories of it. But I don't know that we know how to think about it as rigorously as I wish we did. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2886.0s)]
*  Look, I agree. I mean, again, with Harris, I mean, you have to like, maybe you do have to revise your [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2891.52s)]
*  views a little bit. I think also maybe in a campaign that's like a sprint and not a marathon, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2895.7599999999998s)]
*  then maybe you never reach the long run. It seems possible. Usually I'd say, don't worry about [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2901.8399999999997s)]
*  momentum over the next two weeks. Because inevitably, you're going to have a bad news [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2906.96s)]
*  cycle later on. It's just how the media works. And it's how elections work, right? It is possible [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2911.12s)]
*  they can just sprint their way to like a memeified victory in this shortened, modified campaign, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2916.3999999999996s)]
*  that they have a good convention and that she wins whenever the debate is held, right? And then [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2923.2799999999997s)]
*  you're in October and everyone's crazy and kind of explicitly partisan, like they may be able to [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2927.28s)]
*  sprint to a narrow electoral college victory without having this skeptical news cycle. So [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2931.76s)]
*  that'd be an argument for Walls, I think. One of the reasons on my mind is not actually Walls. And [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2936.7200000000003s)]
*  as I said before, because I do want to say this, I'm not sure who she should have picked as VP. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2941.92s)]
*  Like I actually have very conflicted views on this, although I really, really enjoy Tim Walls [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2945.2000000000003s)]
*  and really enjoyed interviewing him and think he's a pretty unusual political talent. But I think [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2951.44s)]
*  you could say the same about Josh Shapiro in different ways. And Pennsylvania is a very big [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2955.44s)]
*  state. But I've been interested in the shift in like you have a campaign staffed by many of the [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2958.96s)]
*  same people, particularly in the first two weeks. And yet the campaign's tenor has completely [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2966.4s)]
*  changed, right? The tone of press releases is now they are trying to get you to talk about them. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2972.32s)]
*  And doing that by courting controversy, by being kind of mean in a way Democrats have not been mean [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2979.28s)]
*  in a long time, right? That Tim Walls actually made a JD Vance couch joke in his introducing [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2984.4s)]
*  himself as her vice presidential pick speech. Let's put it this way. That is not something that [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2993.6s)]
*  Joe Biden campaign was going to do, right? They want people to talk about them. They want to court [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=2998.8s)]
*  kind of controversy, outrage. They want attention. But I think the reason it's all on my mind is what [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3004.48s)]
*  I am seeing in them is a radically different relationship to attention than the campaign that [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3010.8s)]
*  the same people were running two weeks ago. This is why we rely on you for like how much these people [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3020.0800000000004s)]
*  overlap. Like that's not something I really... They overlap tremendously. Yeah. I mean, it's not the [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3025.6800000000003s)]
*  exact same people. McDonald isn't running things anymore. But there's enough of the same people [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3029.76s)]
*  here that you're not dealing with like nobody knew how to write these press releases a month ago. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3034.0800000000004s)]
*  It is interesting that Joe Biden, based on the polling, would probably be even better off in [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3039.92s)]
*  election with low turnout, right? The one thing that might have saved him is if you get that [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3045.84s)]
*  special election, midterm election, lower turnout, where people aren't very happy about it, but they [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3050.4s)]
*  go to the polls and vote for Biden and the Trump people don't bother to show up, right? Because [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3055.84s)]
*  unlike in the past, the marginal voters have been more likely to vote for Trump than for Biden, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3060.08s)]
*  right? And so maybe by having a really boring campaign, it kind of suited their interests. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3066.32s)]
*  With Harris, who is bringing back some of the younger voters and some of the voters of color [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3070.88s)]
*  that had defected to Kennedy or defected to Trump or defected to sitting out the election, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3077.1200000000003s)]
*  those are also some of the more marginal voters. And so now all of a sudden, she probably doesn't [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3082.6400000000003s)]
*  mind as much higher turnout, which is going to get young Latina women to vote for her, young black [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3086.4s)]
*  men to vote for her when they might not have voted for Biden. And so it kind of matches the [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3092.48s)]
*  incentives of where you want turnout to be on November 5th. Tim Alberta in the Atlantic had a [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3096.32s)]
*  great piece on the way the Trump campaign was thinking about the race that came out very right [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3100.2400000000002s)]
*  around the time of the debate or right after the debate. And they felt they had Nevada, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3105.44s)]
*  North Carolina completely locked up and Georgia. And that this was really like a race in three, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3112.32s)]
*  maybe four states. My understanding is Harris and her team think they have re-expanded the map, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3122.24s)]
*  right? They think that Nevada, Arizona, Georgia are for sure back in play. They think that North [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3128.24s)]
*  Carolina might be back in play. Do you think that's true? Do you think the map has gotten bigger? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3134.4799999999996s)]
*  I think that's right. Because again, look at the voters that Biden was falling off with, right? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3140.0s)]
*  Nevada, people don't remember. They think of it as kind of libertarian old miners, right? No, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3144.4799999999996s)]
*  Nevada is extremely diverse and it's like working class voters of color, right? Big fall off [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3148.72s)]
*  constituency for Biden. Georgia, you have tons of young professionals and tons of great colleges [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3154.0s)]
*  and universities and of course, tons of black voters, right? The same groups that he's declining [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3159.7599999999998s)]
*  from a little bit. North Carolina has been interestingly kind of close in the polls. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3163.68s)]
*  Arizona is the one that doesn't seem to have moved quite as much. There was one poll yesterday with [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3167.92s)]
*  Harris ahead there. But that's right. I mean, I think the map has expanded and it's obviously [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3172.08s)]
*  plausible again now that she would win Georgia, especially with the Brian Kemp stuff not helping [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3176.72s)]
*  Trump win bit. I mean, at the moment, I was playing in a poker tournament, very on brand, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3181.8399999999997s)]
*  right? At a moment when Trump gets shot, right? And has the iconic photo, which, you know, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3186.0s)]
*  I'm not a Trump fan, but you kind of have to admire that, I think a little bit. I think a lot [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3191.3599999999997s)]
*  of people seem like, oh, he's just going to win the election, right? Just, I mean, with Biden already [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3196.08s)]
*  and he's not going to lose after this. They try to shoot him and he has this great photo opportunity, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3200.16s)]
*  right? And then it seems like he's at a high watermark and then he picks JD Vance. And I [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3203.92s)]
*  think got a little arrogant and because his initial instinct apparently was not to pick necessarily [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3210.0s)]
*  JD Vance and kind of talked out of it by his sons. And I don't know what influence Peter Thiel or [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3216.8s)]
*  whatever had, or like the, you know, but the VC guys were like, oh, JD Vance is kind of one of us, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3220.88s)]
*  right? And he probably is like smarter than the average VP or something. But like that appeal has [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3225.6800000000003s)]
*  been demonstrated not to work very, I mean, you saw it with, with like masters, for example, right? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3232.0s)]
*  It works every now and then, I guess, you know, Rick Scott had a background and I don't know what [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3237.44s)]
*  exactly, but like Medicare fraud. Okay. Yeah. But for the most part, like these, the guy, the guy ran [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3241.12s)]
*  health company that was convicted of the single largest Medicare fraud at that point in history. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3247.84s)]
*  But I tell my VC friends is if you have a rich guy, just have him buy a basketball team or [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3254.16s)]
*  something, right? He's not going to come across very well to, to the average voter. And I think [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3257.84s)]
*  they don't, they don't understand that. And then, you know, again, in the poker tournament [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3262.96s)]
*  or a poker home cash game, when you go from having a big stack and you're kind of like, oh, this is [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3266.88s)]
*  so nice, man, I'm going to go home and cash out my winnings. Maybe I'll have a nice little whiskey at [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3271.04s)]
*  the bar or something, right? And this is going to be, I'll text my friends about how well my session [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3275.84s)]
*  ran. And then you lose a big pot. Then you lose another big pot. And then you go on tilt. And [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3279.6800000000003s)]
*  before long, you have no chips left. What is tilt? Tilt is playing emotionally, particularly in poker [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3283.28s)]
*  or other forms of gambling. It's often sparked by, by a bad beat, meaning that you got unlucky, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3288.88s)]
*  or it can be sparked by getting bluffed and getting mad at your opponent, or bad luck, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3295.52s)]
*  or sometimes you can actually have what's called winners tilt to where maybe this is what Trump had [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3299.6000000000004s)]
*  in picking JD Vance. You have a bunch of things that are going really well. I mean, this election [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3304.1600000000003s)]
*  was going about as well as it could for, for Donald Trump. He's not a popular guy. He had [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3307.84s)]
*  moved ahead and some of the national polls by four or five points. It's like pretty hard to do. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3313.2s)]
*  And he's lost a popular vote twice. It feels very on tilt to me. I mean, when you think about him, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3317.9199999999996s)]
*  for Donald Trump, he had been pretty on his message, right? He was talking a lot about [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3324.7999999999997s)]
*  immigration. He was talking a lot about inflation. He was letting it be known that he was thinking [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3333.2799999999997s)]
*  about picking Doug Burgum. He seemed to be enjoying this idea that he was, you know, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3338.4s)]
*  people were longing for a stability. They now associated with his presidency, rightly or wrongly. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3345.6s)]
*  They wanted the lower prices back. You know, they don't like the war in Gaza. They don't like the [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3351.6s)]
*  war in Ukraine, right? Maybe Trump is a strong man who can bring it back. And he was kind of playing [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3356.56s)]
*  into that. And since the Harris switch and him beginning to fall on the polls, you feel this [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3361.12s)]
*  old Trump returning the Trump who goes to Georgia and begins yelling at the governor, the Republican [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3369.92s)]
*  governor of Georgia, the Trump that goes to the National Association of Black Journalists and [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3374.48s)]
*  begins talking about how nobody knew Kamala Harris was black. The Trump who, you know, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3378.4s)]
*  is just trying out attack lines, trying to find something that will work no matter what the kind [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3385.3599999999997s)]
*  of cost might be. I mean, your description of him playing emotionally, he's not listening to [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3389.76s)]
*  anybody right now. He's flailing. And the fact that according to the reporting, I mean, that they [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3395.36s)]
*  weren't prepared for the eventuality when Joe Biden dropped out was kind of inexcusable. I mean, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3400.6400000000003s)]
*  if you looked at prediction markets, it was immediately a live consideration after the debate. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3405.6000000000004s)]
*  I think they overestimated the degree to which Democrats are a personality cult. I mean, they [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3410.4s)]
*  can be. There was maybe a personality cult around Obama or Bill Clinton or things like that. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3415.28s)]
*  But there wasn't one around Joe Biden. He was kind of always a candidate of the party. And it was [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3419.7599999999998s)]
*  not in the party's interest any longer to have him as their nominee. And so the Democratic Party is [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3425.2799999999997s)]
*  capable and powerful and in a way the GOP is not. And they extrapolated from their views [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3430.96s)]
*  to how Democrats would behave and underestimated, you know, the smart decision that the party was [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3437.92s)]
*  capable of making. I talked to Republicans about this, about why they weren't more prepared. And [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3443.68s)]
*  one thing I heard from them is they just didn't think Biden was going to step aside. I mean, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3447.6s)]
*  if you're a party that has completely bent the knee to Donald Trump and is now years and years [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3452.08s)]
*  into not being able to convince Donald Trump of functionally anything, you might, it might shift [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3457.68s)]
*  your sense of how people empower, particularly the apex of power act. It's one reason this is [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3462.64s)]
*  a place where you and I've been a little bit different. I've been more on the side of Joe [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3468.3199999999997s)]
*  Biden did something difficult that deserves praise because, and I think you see this in how [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3474.08s)]
*  Republicans were thinking leaders just often don't do this. They, the kind of personality that gets [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3479.2799999999997s)]
*  you to that point is not the kind of personality that leaves power gracefully. It's why when people [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3485.12s)]
*  are talking about dictators, there's endlessly this talk of how to create golden parachutes for [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3491.36s)]
*  dictators. You're dealing with a kind of human being that has told a story about their own [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3494.7999999999997s)]
*  essentialness scene. Going back to your point about Elon Musk and feeling like you're the main [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3501.28s)]
*  character of, you know, of global life, right? But he become the American president. You sort of were [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3506.0s)]
*  the main character of global life for, for, for a while that does something to you. Those people [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3510.4s)]
*  don't give it up easily. No. And if you look at the history of before there was whichever amendment [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3516.96s)]
*  was 20 something amendment, 22nd, that prevents you from running for more than two terms. It was [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3520.96s)]
*  pretty routine for candidates to tease the, I mean, Woodrow Wilson had a stroke and wanted a [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3526.8s)]
*  third term. Harry Truman had like a 32% approval rating and wanted a, a third term, second full [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3532.48s)]
*  term, right? You know, old men are often pretty stubborn and, and, you know, I mean, I think the [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3539.1200000000003s)]
*  most interesting thing is that if Harris wins or maybe comes close, but mostly if she wins, right, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3545.6800000000003s)]
*  what that will say about the primary system, right? Maybe we should go back to giving a larger role [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3550.8s)]
*  to superdelegates, for example. I want to end on a part of your book. I found really interesting, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3556.0s)]
*  which is about the physical experience of risk in gambling, but in other things, you talk about pain [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3562.8s)]
*  tolerance, you talk about how the body feels when you're, you know, behind on a hand and you're [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3571.44s)]
*  losing your, your chips. You've talked about being on tilt, but I see it in, in politics too. I mean, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3576.72s)]
*  there is a physical question that comes into the decisions you make. I see it on this podcast or [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3581.36s)]
*  times when an, and a question is physically uncomfortable for me to ask another person. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3588.6400000000003s)]
*  Tell me a bit about how you think about this relationship between like the, like the body [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3594.48s)]
*  and the ability to act under pressure, to make intuitive decisions in moments of very high [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3602.6400000000003s)]
*  stress. So, you know, human beings have tens of thousands of years of evolutionary pressure, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3608.72s)]
*  which is inclined to respond in a heightened way to moments that are high stakes, that are high [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3614.7999999999997s)]
*  stress moments. If you've ever been in a situation where you saw someone's life in danger or your [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3620.7999999999997s)]
*  own life was in danger, you know, I was in LA in January and there was an arm robbery outside the [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3628.24s)]
*  place where I was trying to get just a cup of coffee and time kind of slows down a little bit [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3634.48s)]
*  in situations like that. And you don't realize how stressed out you are until like I texted my [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3639.84s)]
*  partner and be like, LOL, almost got shot. And I was kind of like, oh yeah, I'm too cold for school. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3644.8s)]
*  And then like an hour later, I'm like getting some tacos or something. And I'm like, almost like [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3649.6s)]
*  break down. It's like, oh my God, I could have done really, really badly. Public speaking also [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3653.28s)]
*  triggers us for people because of objectively it's a pretty high stakes thing. Your body knows, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3657.28s)]
*  if you're playing a $1, $2 poker game and it's nothing for you, your body will know when you're [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3661.84s)]
*  playing a $100, $200 game where it really matters, you will just know you'll experience that stress. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3666.88s)]
*  Even if you suppress it consciously, it will still affect the way that you're literally kind of [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3671.44s)]
*  ingesting your five senses. So if your heart rate goes up, that has discernible effects. But [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3676.1600000000003s)]
*  actually your body's providing you with kind of more information. You're taking in more in these [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3684.2400000000002s)]
*  kind of short bursts of time. You know, people who can master that zone, and I use the term zone [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3688.4s)]
*  intentionally because it's very related to like being in the zone, like Michael Jordan used to [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3693.84s)]
*  talk about or Balfour's or hockey goalies, whatever else learning to master that and relish that is a [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3698.64s)]
*  very, is a very powerful skill because you are experiencing physical stress, whether you want to [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3704.4s)]
*  or not. How much is that in your view, in your experience, learnable and how much of it is a [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3709.12s)]
*  kind of natural physical intelligence? Some people have and some people don't. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3714.7999999999997s)]
*  I think it's actually quite learnable. It's a little bit like, you know, if you've been on [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3718.56s)]
*  mushrooms before, then you kind of learn like, oh, this is the part of the brain that is, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3725.52s)]
*  this is the things that look a little funny when you're on mushrooms, right? And kind of maybe like [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3732.3999999999996s)]
*  tone it up or tone it down a little bit. So it's very much like that, right? I mean, it's terrifying [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3736.16s)]
*  the first time it happens, but when you start to recognize it and you kind of make a conscious [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3741.2799999999997s)]
*  effort to slow down a little bit, right? And kind of take your time and try to like execute the [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3745.44s)]
*  basics. It's not as much about like trying to be a hero. It's about trying to execute the basics [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3751.68s)]
*  because everyone, whenever it's losing their shit, if you can do your basic ABC blocking and tackling, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3756.24s)]
*  then you're ahead of 95% of people and keeping bandwidth free for dealing with emergency [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3760.3199999999997s)]
*  situations like that will take you very far. It's funny because that feels to me like a very [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3765.52s)]
*  important question that is hard to test in politics. People have to make profound decisions [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3770.4s)]
*  under incredibly high stress. And we have simulacrums of it, right? The debate in a way [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3777.12s)]
*  is a simulacrum of that very, very high stress speeches on teleprompters are not very good [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3781.2000000000003s)]
*  analogies for that. But this question of how good is a person at that moment? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3786.7200000000003s)]
*  How do you evaluate that? I mean, Trump after getting shot kind of performed very well. And [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3793.44s)]
*  I think, you know, again, the Harris moment of leaping right into action to secure the nomination [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3798.88s)]
*  also has to be seen as very good performance under stress, right? So and Biden's failure [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3804.96s)]
*  under stress, I mean, he went to some type of some kind of spiral of some kind or another [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3810.8s)]
*  physical or mental or whatever else. So those kind of three pivotal moments, the assassination, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3815.44s)]
*  the debate, and then Harris season, the nomination and record time speak to the [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3820.0s)]
*  difference in performance. And that's why the two of them, Harris and Trump are still candidates for [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3823.76s)]
*  the presidency and Biden is not. I was just reading Nancy Pelosi's new book before I was [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3827.6s)]
*  reading yours, because I just had her on the show. And she talks about how above all, she says that [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3831.12s)]
*  what a speaker of house needs is intuition. They need to be able to act. And she says that the key [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3837.7599999999998s)]
*  thing is you have to act fast, because every moment you don't act, your options are diminishing. And [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3842.64s)]
*  I ended up thinking that I'm reading your book of it. Because what she was describing is quite, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3848.3199999999997s)]
*  I think, for her physical, like something in her knows how to act and is unafraid to act in those [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3854.24s)]
*  moments. The thing that was crucial about her, I think, in this process inside the Democratic Party [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3860.9599999999996s)]
*  of getting Biden out, is she was willing to act to act in public to take the pressure of that [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3865.3599999999997s)]
*  in ways very few people were and somebody had to be doing that in public to create space for others [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3872.7999999999997s)]
*  to be considering it in private. But you look at her career, and she has a sort of intuitive [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3876.9599999999996s)]
*  capability to know when to move. And there's something in it that I don't think she can [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3882.88s)]
*  explain how she does it, but it makes her a fascinating leader. People believe that she will [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3889.84s)]
*  act and she will act because something in her knows when to act and she's unafraid. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3895.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. So is gut instinct overrated or underrated? Well, it depends on how much experience you have, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3899.6800000000003s)]
*  right? Poker players have, because now poker is actually kind of a solved game. There are [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3904.6400000000003s)]
*  computer solvers, they're called, that spit out this very complicated solution to poker, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3908.72s)]
*  hard to execute in practice, but, you know, technically speaking, a solved game. However, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3912.9599999999996s)]
*  you know, the best poker players can have uncannily good instincts based on reading [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3917.52s)]
*  physical tells, just the kind of vibe someone gives off. And if, you know, I played a lot of [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3922.3999999999996s)]
*  poker and running this book, more live poker than I had in the past, and like, you develop a, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3926.56s)]
*  a sixth sense, not all the time. It helps if you're well rested, but you develop a sixth sense for [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3931.7599999999998s)]
*  whether someone has like a strong hand or something like they're glowing green or something, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3937.84s)]
*  almost sometimes. And you can test it because you can say, I know that I'm supposed to fold [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3941.28s)]
*  this hand here. It's a little bit too weak to, to call against a bluff, but I just have a sense [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3946.96s)]
*  that he's bluffing. And lo and behold, you're right more often than you think, right? More often than [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3951.76s)]
*  you need to be to make that call correct, based on the odds you're getting from the pot. So if [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3956.48s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi has, you know, decades and decades of experience in politics and kind of reading the [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3961.04s)]
*  moves of, of how the coalition is moving. I mean, that's something where intuition probably plays [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3966.4s)]
*  a pretty good, pretty good role. And also the fact that being willing to work with incomplete [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3970.56s)]
*  information. I mean, I don't know how much longer Biden could have, you know, maybe they could have [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3975.36s)]
*  run out the clock potentially. And, you know, when they a hundred percent could have that day when [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3980.08s)]
*  he sent that letter, congressional Democrats and said, I'm not leaving. This conversation is over. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3985.52s)]
*  Stop trying to overturn the will, the primary voters. I was getting congressional Democrats [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3990.0s)]
*  on me. This is done. It's a fait accompli. He's quelled the rebellion. It looked to me like he had. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3993.84s)]
*  I was talking to other people. They said, you know, 10% shot. He's out. Nancy Pelosi goes on Morning [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=3998.32s)]
*  Joe two days later and says, we're really looking forward to him making a decision. And I asked her [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4002.8s)]
*  about it. And I said, what was happening? He had just sent that letter. And she said, yeah, but that [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4007.2000000000003s)]
*  was just a letter. Yeah. I didn't accept the letter as anything but a letter. I mean, and another, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4011.04s)]
*  there are some people who were unhappy with the letter. Let me say some said that some people [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4017.68s)]
*  were unhappy with the letter. I'll put it in somebody else's mouth because it was a, I don't [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4023.7599999999998s)]
*  really know. It didn't sound like Joe Biden to me. I'm like, oh, you read a bluff. So I think Nancy [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4028.24s)]
*  Pelosi might be pretty good at poker. Good place to end. Always our final question. What are three [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4034.64s)]
*  books you'd recommend to the audience? So one book is pertinent to the discussion that we had a moment [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4039.12s)]
*  ago, which is called the hour between dog and wolf. It's written by John Coates, who was an [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4043.12s)]
*  academic economist who then became a derivatives trader, I think, for Deutsche Bank in New York, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4047.52s)]
*  and found out that the traders that he studied were really weird, right? Like these traders would [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4054.0s)]
*  have strange physical and mental stress responses to the market rising or falling. And he was so [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4059.2s)]
*  fascinated by it that he went back and became a neuroscientist and like basically did studies of [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4063.68s)]
*  traders. So you, you know, you read a test the testosterone of like an options trader or a guy [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4068.64s)]
*  who works at a hedge fund and see how it varies from day to day and correlates with performance. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4075.04s)]
*  So, so yeah, so he studies the physical responses of risk takers. And the book is called the hour [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4079.2s)]
*  between dog and wolf. So that's one recommendation. Number two, in a totally different direction, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4083.92s)]
*  the making of the atomic bomb by Richard Rhodes. We didn't talk as much about some of the AI stuff [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4089.04s)]
*  today. But at the end of the book, there's a pretty long, elaborate comparison between the [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4094.16s)]
*  Manhattan Project and the building of these large language models that some people think [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4099.28s)]
*  could be potentially very dangerous. And, you know, nuclear weapons are, I think, a pivot point [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4103.68s)]
*  in human history. And this book is kind of the best history of that. The third is called addiction [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4108.639999999999s)]
*  by design by Natasha Shull. And Natasha is an NYU anthropologist who studied Las Vegas is like her [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4112.88s)]
*  thesis, basically, she did like a lot of reporting just about the properties of slot machines, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4119.44s)]
*  and how addictive they are and about the kind of casino gambling industry in general. And of course, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4125.28s)]
*  she draws metaphors between that and the rest of society. Nate Silver, thank you very much. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4129.2s)]
*  Thank you, Ezra. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRaRaNSpIM&t=4134.32s)]
