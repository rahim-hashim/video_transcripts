# Matter of Opinion: A Look at the 2024 G.O.P. Primary Field
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [May 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9zDT3f8n7A)
*  What nickname do you think Trump would give to us?
*  Do you think you'd merit a nickname, Carlos?
*  Maybe Lil Carly or something like that.
*  He would play off like little Marco, little Carlo.
*  Lazy, Lazy, Lizzotta.
*  Yeah.
*  Does he have a nickname for you, Ross?
*  I don't think I have a nickname.
*  I do have, I wrote a column after he won the Republican nomination that said, like, you
*  know, what's the biggest thing you got wrong in the last year?
*  I thought Trump couldn't win the Republican nomination and he proved me wrong, but I still
*  don't think he'll be president.
*  Somebody cut out the column for it and he like scribbled on it, like, I'm going to prove
*  you wrong again, signed Donald Trump.
*  My wife actually framed it.
*  From New York Times Opinion, I'm Lydia Polgrain.
*  I'm Michelle Cottle.
*  I'm Ross Dowsett.
*  I'm Carlos Lizzotta.
*  And this is Matter of Opinion.
*  We may be 77 weeks out from the election.
*  My God.
*  But we are back in the presidential election cycle.
*  There are already half a dozen Republican candidates who've declared and Florida Governor
*  Ron DeSantis expected to announce any day now.
*  What do these candidates say about the party's hope of winning in a post-Trump world?
*  So before we dive in, I just wanted to sort of frame things by saying that this last weekend
*  did kind of feel like an inflection point, even 7,700 weeks out or whatever we are, because
*  first we just seen Trump steamroll his way through a CNN town hall, which sort of brought
*  back fond memories of 2016.
*  And then he and DeSantis were both supposed to head to Iowa for competing events.
*  And Trump canceled his rally over threats or supposed threats of severe weather.
*  And then the storm didn't materialize and DeSantis headed for the area where Trump was
*  supposed to appear and basically showed him up with a kind of impromptu Iowa rally.
*  And it actually kind of felt like a real campaign moment rather than the kind of virtual, you
*  know, Twitter-based shadowboxing.
*  And it was also, I mean, let's be honest, one of the first really positive headlines
*  that DeSantis has generated in the last couple of months when really most of the coverage
*  has been about his polling sag and Trump's return to double digit leads.
*  And so maybe we should start there.
*  Before we launch into DeSantis, which I totally want to do.
*  You're just you're chomping at the end.
*  You've got DeSantis mania.
*  I want to go back to the 77 weeks thing, right?
*  It's awesome to talk about the Republican field for 2024.
*  I want to know what everyone thinks about that.
*  But at this stage, is it really possible to have any meaningful sense of how things are
*  developing?
*  In 2015, at this point, exactly, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio were like the big
*  thing.
*  At this point in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was the man.
*  Right?
*  So I remember it well.
*  Do we think there's something unique about this race, i.e. Trump, that makes things clearer
*  and different, you know, 77 weeks out?
*  You know, I think what's what's unique is you have a one term defeated president who's
*  trying to come back and that one term defeated president is Donald Trump.
*  And of course, in 2016, you had a wide open primary.
*  Now you have a sort of semi open primary, right?
*  Because there is this kind of quasi incumbent who's actually not an current incumbent, which
*  is a very unusual dynamic.
*  It's a very unusual situation, in part because Donald Trump turned the Republican Party into
*  a cult of personality.
*  And it's hard to kind of move on from that.
*  And that's what you're seeing.
*  And I do think it's a little early to kind of know these things go up and down and everybody
*  can say, well, it's over.
*  DeSantis has blown his moment.
*  But there's a lot of folks who are still thinking about piling in.
*  There's a lot of donors and, you know, even base voters who are very twitchy about kind
*  of where this is all going.
*  There is a lot of Trump fatigue.
*  Trump fatigue is real.
*  We're still looking at will Mike Pence jump in any day now?
*  There's a lot going on and you got to let this play out.
*  Yeah, I'd love for somebody to make the case that DeSantis hasn't peaked.
*  One sign is that Trump has yet to settle on a truly winning nickname for him.
*  I don't think Meatball Ron really does it.
*  I like putting fingers.
*  I think Meatball Ron is actually the winner.
*  I think it taps into latent, mild, but real anti-Italian prejudice in a way that...
*  What?
*  I'm only 50% kidding here.
*  I think it is more effective than DeSanctimonious, a word lots of people don't even recognize.
*  It doesn't even apply really.
*  Mike Pence is sanctimonious.
*  Ron DeSantis isn't.
*  But yeah.
*  But I really want to talk about who DeSantis is and what he stands for.
*  And I'm curious.
*  I mean, Carlos, God bless.
*  You've done a lot of reading of DeSantis's own.
*  Are you saying you haven't all read The Courage to Be Free, Florida's blueprint for America's
*  revival?
*  Florida's blueprint.
*  I don't know why.
*  I have eyes to see and ears to hear.
*  I mean, so I watched the speech that he gave in Iowa.
*  And what's interesting is that he has a real script because a lot of it is verbatim from
*  The Courage to Be Free, Florida's blueprint for America's revival, hashtag, trademark.
*  So for better or for worse, it's got...
*  What is it?
*  The anti-Woke, anti-DI, anti-Disney stuff, which has become kind of like standard DeSantis
*  stump speech to the extent that he's doing stump speeches.
*  His case against Trump specifically, I think, is more interesting.
*  It's kind of stylistic.
*  It's tactical.
*  It's not super substantive.
*  It's what passes for subtle in American politics now, right?
*  So he stresses that, and he did this in the speech and in the book, that government is
*  not about entertaining or about building your social media brand, you know, hint, hint.
*  He says the key to expand the base, not just appeal to current Republican voters, hint,
*  hint, and to present a vision of the future, not wallow in the past, i.e. 2020, hint, hint.
*  He doesn't mention January 6th at all in the book, but he does say that executives should
*  govern within the confines of the constitutional system.
*  He criticizes elected officials who want to perpetuate themselves in office.
*  Again, none of this while mentioning Trump.
*  So he's got the talking points down.
*  I think the case he's making is like, yeah, I'm as much of a culture warrior as the next
*  guy, but I'm a competent cultural warrior.
*  Well, that speaks directly to what appeals to a lot of donors and non-Trumpy Republicans,
*  is that he is Trump, but not crazy.
*  I mean, that's always been his selling point.
*  So he is just as conservative and just as anti-woke, which is also in these polls, something
*  that is very big for Republican primary voters.
*  They want somebody who's anti-woke, but he's not a lunatic.
*  And so he's not going to wind up mired in two impeachments.
*  But how much of the lunacy is also part of the appeal?
*  I mean, for some people, that is part of the appeal.
*  And my question with DeSantis has always been, can you be a demagogue if you're completely
*  anti-charismatic?
*  Well, part of the question, though, too, right, is that, yes, in certain ways, he is casting
*  himself as the competent Trump, the guy who fights the liberals, fights the woke, fights
*  the progressives and actually wins.
*  But then there are other ways in which, so far, he's not Trump.
*  I'm stealing this from someone on Twitter.
*  So apologies to whoever said this.
*  HOST 1 Homage, homage, not theft.
*  HOST 2 But there's a way in which he's sort of like trying to be Ted Cruz, except not
*  Ted Cruz.
*  Right?
*  Because if you look back at 2016, what was Ted Cruz's strategy?
*  Ted Cruz's strategy was to be just as sort of vehement as Trump in going after the liberal
*  media and progressives and cultural liberals and so on, to win Iowa by rallying social
*  and religious conservatives.
*  And this is clearly part of the DeSantis strategy.
*  He is somewhat to Trump's right on abortion, and that will play better in Iowa than it
*  will in some other states.
*  And if you look at what DeSantis has done in Florida, he's been incredibly legislatively
*  successful.
*  But a lot of it is sort of where the conservative movement wants you to be.
*  It's school choice, it's immigration and so on.
*  But I think that's just a big open question, right?
*  Because we watched Cruz run this play against Trump, say, I'm the truer conservative, I
*  can fight the libs too.
*  And it didn't work.
*  One reason it didn't work, though, was that the entire Republican establishment hated
*  Ted Cruz.
*  And lots of establishment Republicans in the end were like, okay, binary choice, Ted Cruz,
*  Donald Trump.
*  I gotta go with Trump.
*  DeSantis is, I think, assuming that that will not be the case with him.
*  One difference in the Cruz-DeSantis thing, though, is that when Cruz was doing this,
*  it was still premised on the notion that eventually Trump's support would collapse.
*  And you had to be ready, waiting to catch all those voters, right?
*  It didn't.
*  And now we know that Trump can win, right?
*  So you can't just sort of sit there in the holding pattern, waiting for the support to
*  collapse, thinking that you have the kind of the proper set of views that will allow
*  you to scoop up those voters.
*  So I don't know that the Cruz playbook then makes a lot of sense.
*  Yes, I think that's right.
*  Precisely because Republican voters have now voted for Trump twice in presidential
*  elections, there is this bond with him, even through January 6 and afterward.
*  That kind of full tilt, never Trump kind of line is not what you want to do.
*  Instead, you have to hope that you can say, look, Trump says the election was stolen,
*  but who was in charge when the Democrats were supposedly stealing it?
*  Trump says we should have opened sooner, but who appointed Fauci, right?
*  Trump says all these people betrayed him, but who appointed them?
*  And see if that works.
*  I don't know if it will, but I think that's the needle thread you have to try.
*  What's interesting, both in the speech and in the book, DeSantis, when he talks about
*  Florida's COVID response and he's bragging about that, the contrast is always with Anthony
*  Fauci.
*  It's never with Donald Trump, right?
*  It's always Fauciism and the Iron Curtain of Fauciism descended upon America and Florida
*  was West Berlin and all the rest.
*  And it's this attack on the Faucian dystopia and never on the person who was in charge
*  during the first year of COVID.
*  He's attacking him by proxy, right?
*  There's always this kind of subtlety to it and subtlety doesn't really play so well
*  with primary voters in the GOP.
*  Primary voting base.
*  I mean, that will be one of the interesting things to see as the primary heats up and
*  you have to have head-to-head conflict.
*  How is DeSantis going to thread that?
*  I mean, Trump has said that he will probably skip a couple of primary debates, but he's
*  presumably planning to show up for some of them.
*  Kind of what does that look like?
*  The stage could collapse by that point.
*  There could be so many people on it, but DeSantis won't be able to duck that forever, in part
*  because as you say, you can't just be subtle in this political environment.
*  I mean, I think the other thing is that aggrieved victimhood is the most comfortable groove
*  for Trump to be in when he's appealing to his base.
*  And I think that there's something very powerful in that, you know, I am your vengeance.
*  I am the person who stands in for you.
*  And I think that if you couple that, and Ross, you alluded to this, to his very careful positioning
*  on abortion, I think he has a very clear sense that that's a vulnerability going into the
*  general election and that that is a place where he has in the past and can continue
*  to in the future, bob and weave and find a way through and perhaps have a shot at, you
*  know, taking back some of the upper Midwest.
*  If abortion is not on the ballot, then his kind of squishy stated opinion of like, we're
*  going to leave it to the states, maybe prevents a huge turnout from coming out in a state
*  like Michigan and gives him a shot at it again.
*  That feels like an unlikely set of events, but the combination of grievance and the ability
*  to kind of hold multiple contradictory views at once feels like very powerful.
*  Well, this is the advantage of being someone who's running on a personality based campaign
*  as opposed to somebody who's running on principles or policies or ideology.
*  Trump is just all about, I'm a victim, you're a victim, they're out to get us.
*  And that gives him an awful lot of wiggle room.
*  One thing I wanted to get your read on about Ron DeSantis is this weird tick he has.
*  It came up in the Iowa speech.
*  He mentions it twice in the book where he often talks about how much money he could
*  have made if he had gone on to practice law after Harvard Law School rather than going
*  into the Navy.
*  And I think of that in terms of the sort of discussions about populism and like what lane
*  he represents.
*  Is it because like he said in the Iowa speech, he said, I could have made boatloads of money,
*  but I didn't, you know, I chose to serve.
*  Is that a contrast to Trump being wealthy and not serving?
*  Is that him saying, well, I could be a rich guy too?
*  It's connected to his very kind of conflicted relationship with his education.
*  He talked about his academic pedigree in Iowa, which was super weird.
*  And he often talks about, you know, how he went to Yale and Harvard, but like how much
*  he hated it.
*  You know, he both wants the like elite validation of Yale and Harvard.
*  I mean, who doesn't?
*  Who hasn't taken that approach in their professional career, Carlos?
*  Come on.
*  But like Trump, you know, Trump straight up brags about Wharton, right?
*  Like, you know, he's made his choice, right?
*  DeSantis is trying to kind of both be like, you know, fancy school educated guy and populist.
*  And that just doesn't, it doesn't ring true.
*  You got to pick who you are.
*  You find this with a lot of the top Republicans.
*  I mean, Ted Cruz has the Ivy degrees and he gets to sit around and complain about the
*  elites.
*  I mean, Tom Cotton, a lot of these guys try to do that.
*  And with Trump, I think what worked for him is he grew up rich, but nobody ever respected
*  him.
*  The elites always looked down on him and he knew that and he carries that bitterness with
*  him and it is genuine.
*  It is possibly the most genuine thing about Trump is just his aggrieved sourness that
*  nobody ever gave him what he deemed the proper respect.
*  So if you're a DeSantis, you have to kind of figure out how you're going to do that.
*  So you make this big deal about, you know, I could have been one of the elites, but I
*  have shunned them.
*  I have chosen to be among the people.
*  That's as good as he gets.
*  Well, and I think we shouldn't, speaking on behalf of conservatives who have attended
*  Ivy League schools, there's no reason to assume that that actually isn't genuine.
*  That DeSantis doesn't in fact carry both the sort of banal, you know, conservative among
*  the liberal Ivy Leagueers resentment and the more boutique I went into the military
*  rather than going to work for a fancy law firm kind of resentment.
*  Like, it may not play on the campaign trail.
*  I wouldn't sort of chalk it up to oppose.
*  I think the fact that you sort of notice this suggests to me in this way suggests to me
*  that maybe it's really genuine.
*  I think he is genuine.
*  It certainly comes up all the time.
*  I think it's definitely genuine.
*  I will just say that there's nothing more elite than getting a very, very high toned
*  education and then going into a prestigious but low paid field like public service.
*  Or podcasting.
*  I mean.
*  Podcasting.
*  I want to move on from DeSantis because it turns out there are half a dozen other non-Trump
*  candidates also in the race.
*  So when we come back, we're going to talk about them and what they tell us about the
*  party's attempts to move beyond Trump.
*  And we're back.
*  So I wanted to push the conversation a bit further than Trump and DeSantis because I
*  think there are actually really interesting insights into the Republican Party writ large
*  that you can get from looking at the rest of the field.
*  And I'm curious, who are the candidates that you're most interested by find that they
*  reveal something rich and interesting about the Republican Party today?
*  Michelle, you're looking at me.
*  You have a thought?
*  I do have a thought.
*  I think Tim Scott for me is what the Republican Party kind of wants itself to be on some level.
*  It's like the only black Republican senator.
*  And that gives the party sort of this way to not think of itself as a bunch of grumpy
*  old white racist guys.
*  So he is out there and he's going more for mourning in America than American carnage.
*  And I think this is a very upbeat, diverse, forward looking way that the Republicans want
*  to see themselves.
*  But it's not going to get him very far.
*  But that's who I find like as a window.
*  Well, and one big challenge that he has is that he's a favorite son of South Carolina.
*  There's another South Carolinian in the race and that's Nikki Haley, former governor.
*  She's also represents diversity.
*  She's Indian American and also I think does not have a prayer of winning the nomination.
*  I mean, I think Haley and Scott together, I agree with Michelle that they sort of represent
*  a self-image of the Republican Party, especially the pre-Trump Republican Party.
*  You know, the Republican Party as the party of free market oriented, multiracial optimism
*  about the future of America.
*  The one I'm fascinated by is Mike Pence.
*  I think just the dramatic arc of his story is really interesting.
*  Here's a guy who goes all in with Donald Trump, spends four years giving that like worshipful,
*  resting Pence face gaze, you know, standing behind Donald Trump.
*  Because everything asked of him, every compromise, you know, makes every excuse.
*  And then at the end, when he doesn't do the one thing that Trump wants him to do, toss
*  out the election results, he's cast out, right, hang Mike Pence.
*  So now what does he want to do?
*  He wants to kind of pretend it never happened, right?
*  He, you know, our colleagues on the news side of the New York Times have reported that he
*  intends to run as an old school pre-Trump Reagan coalition conservative, right?
*  Pro-free trade, hawkish foreign policy, fiscal conservative, anti-abortion.
*  It's all the old hits.
*  Right.
*  You can just like erase the blackboard and start again.
*  His, the guy setting up the pro-Pence super PAC ran Bob Dole's campaign.
*  It just feels like Scott Reed.
*  Yes.
*  Scott Reed is back.
*  It's very retro, you know?
*  The irony, of course, of, you know, bringing back the Reagan coalition being the pitch
*  is twofold, right?
*  That Reagan wouldn't hack it in today's Republican Party.
*  Also, Mike Pence didn't vote for Reagan in 1980.
*  He voted for Jimmy Carter.
*  He mentioned that in his memoir, which I was very, very interested by.
*  These are, I mean, and this is similar to Nikki Haley, right?
*  They're running for the nomination of a Republican Party that has ceased to exist.
*  And maybe they'd be competitive in such a Republican Party.
*  Pence is sort of the exception to my view that, you know, you can't get that far attacking
*  Donald Trump's fitness because Pence is the guy where the only narrative arc for him that
*  makes any sense is to be the guy who says the Trump administration was great and Trump
*  himself wrecked it.
*  Not that I think it would work and make him the nominee, but if I were advising Pence,
*  I would say, look, DeSantis is trying to just sort of softly usher Trump off stage.
*  You need to actually try and pick a fight and generate drama and out alpha male him,
*  which I do not anticipate happening.
*  But like that, I think is the only thing that would justify a Pence campaign.
*  Is the argument you're saying that he could say basically everything was fine until January 6?
*  Well, yes, that would absolutely be the argument he would make.
*  Yes.
*  Okay, so Ross, I have a question for you along those lines, though.
*  My question with Pence is what does he offer?
*  I mean, if we're looking at this as a style election, as we were with Trump, you know,
*  about being aggrieved and macho and angry, he doesn't really work in that way.
*  And if you're looking at policy, yes, he's very conservative and he wants to double down
*  on things like abortion, which could be a problem in the general.
*  But when you're talking about even the primary, he's not a populist.
*  He's kind of actually going in the exact opposite direction, which I think is a problem for
*  the base, right?
*  Like if he's talking about cutting Social Security and Medicare and ramping back on
*  that stuff, who is he talking to?
*  He doesn't have the charisma and he doesn't have the policy.
*  Well, again, Carlos is the one who is championing the fascination of Pence, right?
*  I'm not championing his chances, I'm championing the story.
*  I think one challenge is you've got Pence and Haley and Tim Scott right now competing
*  for what is sort of, you know, what probably maxes out at 35 to 40 percent of the party
*  in a field where DeSantis diminishes.
*  I'm curious, Ross, who are you excited about?
*  The candidate who's actually closer to blending the Republican Party's multiracial future
*  with the actual mood of conservatives right now is Vivek Ramaswamy.
*  Oh yeah, Ramaswamy head.
*  Yes, so he is the, you know, one, if you were going for analogies to the last Democratic
*  go-round, it's one part Andrew Yang, one part Pete Buttigieg, right?
*  He is the young, good at talking fast on television, sort of policy-oriented to a slightly
*  crankish degree in some cases.
*  I think he just came out for, you know, predicating the right to vote for early 20-somethings
*  on military service.
*  Or a civics test.
*  Or a civics test, right, which sounds like the right-wing version of the kind of ideas
*  that showed up on Andrew Yang's long lists.
*  He's doing well by the standards of non-Ronda Santis, non-Donald Trump candidates in the
*  polls.
*  He demonstrates in part that there's a lot of conservatives who just like seeing conservatives
*  who can go on television and argue with liberal hosts.
*  This is a really important skill set for a Republican primary.
*  He's basically doing a really, really intense anti-wokeness argument that focuses on wokeness's
*  connection to civil rights law, civil rights bureaucracy, you know, sort of diversity,
*  equity and inclusion enforcement in major corporations as downstream from how the federal
*  government enforces civil rights law.
*  He's certainly much more interesting than what Haley and Scott and Pence are offering
*  to date.
*  Well, he represents something that feels fresher, right, and more attuned to where the Republican
*  party actually is.
*  I think that it taps into the grievance thing that we were talking about with Donald Trump
*  earlier that implicit, and it should be said that Ramaswamy is a very, very rich man and
*  has hundreds of millions of dollars from a biotech company, I believe.
*  Also went to Yale like Ronda Santis.
*  So he's a rich guy, but he's a rich guy that was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth
*  and can sort of credit himself for being a very successful businessman.
*  I think that his pitch about sort of socially responsible investing and DEI and all this
*  kind of stuff goes into that this is why you're being kept down.
*  This is why you're not getting rich is because corporate America has sort of bought into
*  the woke agenda, and that means that ordinary Americans are not able to have access to prosperity
*  in the same way as if it were about that as opposed to, you know, the collapse of late
*  capitalism.
*  It's broader than the Disney alone attack, right?
*  He's taking that but nationalizing it.
*  Well, and to have a brown person make that argument, right?
*  To have someone who is not an aggrieved white guy, but a, you know, the child of an immigrant
*  who has a kind of up from the bootstraps story say, you know, actually, this whole system
*  is hurting all of us, and my story wouldn't be possible if the vision of the woke left
*  for corporate America were to come true.
*  And to me, that that feels like a very potent story to be telling.
*  If Ramaswamy could could get to 30 or 40% of the vote, that is how he would do it potentially
*  with that kind of narrative that basically links says, look, you know, woke capitalism
*  is responsible for economic disappointment, wage stagnation, all of these kind of things.
*  I think right now, his message is very effective, but for a fairly narrow group.
*  I agree that long term, meaning four to eight to 12 years, the candidate who can link a
*  critique of wokeness to some kind of economic narrative of American stagnation or what have
*  you will have a very effective narrative for Republicans and
*  Yeah, and Ramaswamy is like such an effective and clear communicator, right?
*  And I think he knows all the lingo and all the jargon of the anti woke vocabulary.
*  But he I think has a way of doing it differently.
*  The other thing that I wanted to say is that he manages to sort of have a bit of a happy
*  warrior affect as well.
*  There's something kind of sunny and winning about him.
*  And I think that the trick is that and this is this I think really gets to what I think
*  is the kind of fundamental vibe of the Republican Party right now is that it's not sort of,
*  you know, sunny times, you know, city on a hill optimism or anything like that.
*  But it's also not kind of dour.
*  Everything is terrible.
*  I think that the thing that about Ramaswamy is that he sort of does what Trump does, has
*  that happy warrior sense in a much sunnier package that feels appealing and new and fresh
*  in a way that's different.
*  And wow, I can't believe I'm even saying this.
*  No, the Ramaswamy head Lydia Polgrain.
*  I mean, I think I think that the mood in the Republican Party is definitely way darker
*  than it was when Reagan was doing his thing.
*  But there is still a premium for being able to do what Trump does basically and say things
*  are dark.
*  They're the worst they've ever been.
*  But you know, we're turning it around.
*  Make America great again.
*  Things are going to be amazing.
*  Right.
*  And yeah, I agree.
*  Ramaswamy does that more effectively right now than DeSantis in certain ways.
*  So darker than city on a hill, less dark than American carnage.
*  A sweet spot.
*  All right.
*  All right.
*  Okay.
*  I know for a fact between here and November 2024, God help us, we will be talking about
*  many of these people again.
*  But for now, let's put the 2024 race on ice.
*  Speaking of when we come back from the break, things are going to get hot or cold.
*  And we're back.
*  Let's do our hot cold.
*  It's the moment when one of us shares something that we're hot for, cold on, or somewhere
*  on the thermometer between.
*  Michelle, you said you have a hot cold this week.
*  Oh, I am red hot on the flash cult of Hannah Waddingham.
*  Now she is a longtime theater actress, mostly in the West End in London, but she also had
*  a tiny role as Septimella on Game of Thrones.
*  And most American audiences know her as Rebecca Welton on Ted Lasso.
*  She's the team owner.
*  But she has in recent weeks emerged as this global phenom as one of the presenters on
*  Eurovision.
*  We all love Eurovision.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, it's a national music competition where you have every, you know, all these
*  like dozens of bands come together or singers come together and compete.
*  And it was basically the show was stolen by Hannah.
*  She is five foot 11 with platinum blonde hair and a voice that just goes through the roof.
*  And so she would do these amazing vocal riffs or she would do these wacky dances and you're
*  in these massive rainbow hued ball gowns with heels.
*  And it was just this great spectacle.
*  And the audience went crazy.
*  I was like, I had to actually go back and look up even who won this year.
*  Sweden, incidentally, Sweden won Eurovision.
*  But it was really Hannah Waddingham who had everybody going crazy for her.
*  And what I'm hoping now is that Ted Lasso is in its final season.
*  She's coming off Eurovision.
*  I'm now hoping, you know, maybe she could run for president.
*  She's British, but does that really matter?
*  I mean, maybe a nice cabinet position, perhaps.
*  But it was just kind of this glorious moment where this kind of everybody was cheering
*  this bizarre theater phenom who was taking over the airwaves.
*  But she was that she was the host.
*  She was not a contestant.
*  No, she was she was one of the presenters, but it didn't matter.
*  I am completely in the tank here and she is now mine.
*  She's now my hero.
*  I'm just glad that something good will come out of the horror of the last two seasons
*  of Ted Lasso.
*  The first season was so great and then it just really went downhill.
*  So, yeah.
*  But at least they're calling it quits.
*  There are a lot of shows calling it quits.
*  And that's one of them.
*  It's time. It's time to pull the plug.
*  Listen, speaking of pulling the plug.
*  Surprise announcement.
