# What's Happening on Israel's Northern Border
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E36paaQzjGs)
*  Israel has shrunk in a strategic geographic sense.
*  Israel, already a tiny state, has shrunk.
*  This to me was the piece of it that is most potent
*  in the politics there that you hear the least about here.
*  I was up in Kiryat Shmona.
*  It was on fire when I was there.
*  As you say, everything is a ghost town.
*  You're dealing with tens of thousands.
*  I think the number I heard then was 60 to 80,000
*  internal Israeli refugees.
*  I think not all of them from that area, but many.
*  And they, I mean, some of the interviews I did with people
*  who had lived up there, whose family had now been living
*  in a one-bedroom hotel room, somewhere else now
*  for seven months, their fury was palpable.
*  And their question, which they kept posing to me,
*  and I don't have an answer for, but it seems to me
*  to becoming more central in Israeli politics,
*  is what is supposed to make them feel safe enough
*  to go back?
*  I mean, some of these people on the border,
*  they say, look, I can see Hezbollah.
*  And to me, October 7th now feels like
*  a coming attractions preview.
