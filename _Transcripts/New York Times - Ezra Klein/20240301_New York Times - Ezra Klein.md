# The Wars in Ukraine and Gaza Have Changed. America’s Policy Hasn’t.
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF5StQ2wfHU)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Joe Biden's presidency now is dominated by two foreign policy crises, Russia's invasion
*  of Ukraine and Hamas's attack on Israel, which then led to Israel's invasion of Gaza.
*  Early on, both crises lent themselves to clarity.
*  There was no justification for Russia's invasion.
*  There was no justification for Hamas's massacre of Israeli civilians.
*  Both have become considerably more complex.
*  Ukraine does not seem able to fully liberate its territory from Russia.
*  The scale and ferocity and displacement and death toll of Israel's response in Gaza has
*  made Israel, in the eyes of much of the world, in the eyes of even many Americans, into the
*  aggressor.
*  In both of these, America is a supporting actor.
*  We do not call the play.
*  We give Ukraine arms and encircle Russia in sanctions.
*  We give Israel arms and money and protection from UN resolutions.
*  And we ask in return that it act with some respect for Palestinian life, with some view
*  of a peaceful future.
*  But what happens when the lead actors in these conflicts refuse to act as we wish?
*  This is the phase of the wars that we're now in.
*  Zelensky continues to call for full repulsion of Russia's presence, long after many believe
*  that is possible.
*  Netanyahu is prosecuting a war so brutal that Biden is criticized in public.
*  But though we keep supporting Israel, Netanyahu routinely and publicly rejects our vision
*  of both how the war should be conducted now and what should happen afterwards.
*  And that's put Biden in a tough spot.
*  Americans disapprove of his handling of both Ukraine and Israel.
*  Republicans are turning towards isolationism.
*  And I think more accurately put, they're turning towards Trumpism.
*  Whatever Donald Trump says is what they believe.
*  They're refusing to even vote in the House on the latest Ukraine aid package.
*  Israel is splitting the Democratic coalition.
*  It is a central problem for Biden in 2024.
*  It has become not just a foreign policy problem, but a domestic politics problem.
*  And an interesting signal of the frustration and fracture here is Richard Haas.
*  Haas was president of the Council on Foreign Relations for 20 years and is now President
*  Emeritus.
*  Served in multiple presidential administrations.
*  And he is as much as anyone anywhere is the walking, talking center of America's foreign
*  policy establishment.
*  And I've been noticing in his media appearances and in his substack, which is called Home
*  A very particular kind of critique emerging.
*  That our foreign policy is insufficiently independent.
*  That we've become captured by allies we do not control and are not willing to confront.
*  And oftentimes don't even really seem able to influence.
*  Haas has been urging Biden to go around Netanyahu to speak directly to the Israeli people.
*  He's been arguing that we need a new strategy on Ukraine.
*  And so I wanted to hear him out.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at nbytimes.com.
*  Richard Haas, welcome to the show.
*  Great to be with you.
*  So last Friday, the Netanyahu government released a proposal for what they think the day after
*  in Gaza should look like.
*  What did that proposal say?
*  Well, actually told us very little other than the day after looks like today.
*  It looks like continued Israeli military occupation.
*  Some, I think unrealistic hope that they would find quote unquote locals to work with.
*  No mention of the Palestinian authority.
*  So as I read it, Ezra, it sounded to me pretty much like a recipe for open ended occupation
*  and still lacking the political, what would you call it?
*  Complement or analog to Israel's military strategy.
*  What was the Biden administration's response?
*  Well, Jake Sullivan said he had some concerns.
*  I think it was decidedly unenthusiastic.
*  And I think the administration, not that it needed any reminding, got reminded that this
*  Israeli government and this American administration are on very different pages.
*  Indeed, in some ways, they're not in the same book.
*  I'm going to admit, and I think I'm somebody who follows this reasonably closely, that
*  I'm confused about how to describe America's position on this now.
*  So we support Israel.
*  We think Netanyahu is wrong on almost every particular.
*  And we're going to do nothing about that divergence.
*  We're going to have concerns about that divergence.
*  Or another version of this might be that we support Israel's right to defend itself.
*  We think that defense has gone way too far.
*  It's over the top, as the president said at that press conference.
*  But we support Israel anyway.
*  That there's what feels like a quite growing gap and a very explicit gap between what Israel
*  and the Netanyahu government say they want, what we say we want, but then nothing that
*  I really see happening to close the gap between our articulated hopes, desires, beliefs, strategic
*  needs and what's happening there.
*  What am I missing here?
*  You're not confused.
*  Essentially, the United States and Israel see this very differently.
*  The administration has been quietly and increasingly critical of what Israel is doing and not doing.
*  But what's missing is any so what.
*  So you have a situation where from almost the get-go, the president, as everyone listening
*  to this will remember, was extraordinarily supportive of Israel's right and necessity
*  to respond to the barbarism of October 7th.
*  But then you had a real divergence from what you might call the heavy-handed, not discriminating
*  nature of the Israeli response.
*  We've been almost like a disappointed uncle saying, gee, we really don't think this is
*  the way to do it.
*  We really don't think this is in your interest or ours.
*  Let me take a step back.
*  What's odd about U.S. policy now that we're five months into this is everything seems
*  to be premised on the notion that we can persuade this Israeli government, this Israeli prime
*  minister to see things differently and to do things differently, but there's virtually
*  no evidence or precious little evidence that that hypothesis is working.
*  Yes, the Israelis have let some aid in, but otherwise they are going in a very different direction.
*  So to answer your question, I don't think the policy of quiet or gentle persuasion is
*  working.
*  What the administration has to contemplate is whether it's willing to set out on a much
*  more independent policy, not with this Israeli government as a partner, but almost to distinguish
*  between this Israeli government and this prime minister on one hand and Israel and U.S. Israeli
*  relations on the other.
*  Let me try to strongman the Biden administration's view here.
*  When I talk to them about this, what I hear is something that you said there too, which
*  is you don't know what we're doing behind closed doors.
*  You don't know how strong the president's communications and conversations with Netanyahu
*  are.
*  You don't know the kinds of things that we are pushing them on, preventing.
*  Sometimes it is not emotionally satisfying to work behind closed doors, but it is the
*  path of maximal influence.
*  Now one response to this might be that it does not feel to a lot of us like we are being
*  very influential.
*  In fact, it feels like Netanyahu almost takes a certain delight, or maybe to frame it less
*  emotionally, that he sees a certain important politics for himself in publicly spitting
*  on what we are saying.
*  He's very public about his disagreement with us.
*  But one thing I think that this theory misses that is very present in a lot of at least
*  liberal thinking about this issue and liberal feeling about this issue is that the question
*  a lot of people have about foreign policy is not simply what are we doing, how influential
*  are we, but what are we complicit in?
*  And for a lot of people, where even the administration is saying what is happening, Gaza has gone
*  much too far.
*  The idea that America is supplying arms to that, that it is protecting it from UN pressure,
*  that we are not just complicit, but supportive in it, whatever we say, like we are actually
*  providing the material, feels terrible, right?
*  There is a moral dimension to foreign policy.
*  How do you think about that set of concerns, both the pushback from the Biden people and
*  the kind of slightly less realist take that I think is powering a lot of liberal backlash?
*  Couple of reactions.
*  One is that this is typical of a situation where you have a close relationship with another
*  country, but it doesn't mean you agree on everything.
*  So we can't throw the entire relationship to the side because we disagree, for example,
*  with how Israel is prosecuting the war in Gaza.
*  Israel faces some very real challenges from Iran, from Iran-backed proxies and so forth.
*  So how we thread that needle is not easy.
*  One idea I've been advocating for is we can continue to provide Israel with military help,
*  which gets at what you are suggesting, but say it can't be used in certain settings.
*  If we provide you with certain types of large ordnance, large bombs, those can't be used
*  in populated areas of Gaza.
*  In these other areas where I would say the administration has been unwilling, I think
*  the president more than anyone else, has been unwilling to separate himself.
*  We finally have begun to distribute a draft resolution in the UN Security Council after
*  vetoing three over the last few months.
*  We should have done this much sooner where we could control the text and we could distinguish
*  ourselves between what Israel is doing and what we are.
*  I've advocated the president give a speech.
*  I've actually advocated the president go to the Knesset, take a leaf out of Bibi Netanyahu's
*  book who came to the Congress, trash Barack Obama's Iran deal.
*  Well, I think the president should go to the Knesset, speak over the head of this Israeli
*  government directly to the Israeli people.
*  In some ways, don't let Bibi control the narrative.
*  We could get tougher economically.
*  We could, for example, start saying that any Israeli good produced in occupied areas in
*  settlements or something, that those are going to face a special tariff or they're going
*  to at least be labeled as coming from occupied territories.
*  So there's lots of things the United States could do to express disapproval with Israel
*  without throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
*  I want to go back to the question of arms for a minute.
*  When I talk to a lot of people on this issue and I say, what is the leverage America has
*  here?
*  What should America actually be doing that it is not?
*  A lot of the debate is about things like calling for a ceasefire, but just in a practical way,
*  if they wanted to use leverage, what do they have?
*  One thing I'll hear is that we should just stop treating Israel exceptionally from the
*  perspective of our own arms.
*  I mean, we have laws, the Arms Control Export Act, the so-called sort of Leahy rules, and
*  they require for anybody getting arm shipments from us, a pretty stringent look at whether
*  those arms are being used in ways that violate human rights or go against American policy.
*  In what we give and do not give Ukraine, there's been a very public debate about which arms
*  they can have and what they can do with them and what going too far would look like.
*  And there are all kinds of things Ukraine wants that we don't give them.
*  And the argument from some of these people is that we should just de-exceptionalize this,
*  that Israel has been given special exemptions from some of these rules.
*  There was a State Department official who resigned in part over this and has talked
*  about it.
*  We've sort of created a special pathway for their arms, but that this is a problem, that
*  we actually don't need new laws.
*  We don't need new rules.
*  We just need to enforce the ones we have.
*  What do you think of that?
*  I'm pretty sympathetic to that.
*  Look, we had obvious disagreements with Israel in 56 during the Suez crisis.
*  I was involved in something in 1991.
*  This is when the Iraqis first launched missiles against the Israelis.
*  And the Israelis went to then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and said, please give
*  us the codes, what's called IFF, identify friendly versus foe, so that Israeli aircraft
*  could fly against Iraq.
*  And we said no.
*  We didn't give them a green light there.
*  We said that threatens the cohesion of this coalition we built.
*  We'll take care of it.
*  Thank you very much.
*  You've got to stand down.
*  The Israelis weren't happy and they stood down.
*  We subtracted out certain aid from Israel during the loan guarantees, also during the
*  Bush 41 administration.
*  So we have had times where we have basically not given Israel carte blanche, however you
*  want to describe it.
*  We have disagreed with them and they've paid a certain price for it.
*  So I'd be prepared to do that now.
*  Now again, all I'm saying is it's got to be measured.
*  And we've got to recall that again, Israel faces a larger menu of threats, which is why
*  I would not be in favor of withholding arms, say.
*  But the idea of saying we're going to insist on certain what are called end user controls,
*  that you can't use these arms in certain situations where there's lots of civilians present, I
*  think is totally legitimate.
*  I think there's an interesting thing in the American debate about Israel, that Israel
*  faces a large menu of threats, as you put it, which is true, very true.
*  In a way, you'd think that would give us more leverage in the relationship.
*  Israel really needs American support, right?
*  The fact that we put battleships nearby to say if Iran gets into this in any significant
*  way, they can somewhat expect that we're going to have a role as well.
*  That was an important thing that happened right at the beginning of this war.
*  And yet, in some ways, it is used often in the opposite way.
*  I think the question I've had about the Biden administration, the one that I don't feel
*  like I'm able to get a good answer to, but maybe you are, is what is the resistance to
*  using the actual leverage we have at this point, given that, again, there's a divergence
*  and articulated policy.
*  There's a lot of political costs being paid by the Biden administration at this point
*  for the level of support they've given Israel.
*  In ways that do not track how we are in other places, there feels like a real resistance
*  saying we're going to do anything here but words.
*  Why?
*  Let me refer to a wise man I once appeared on a television show with named Ezra Klein.
*  You divided American thinking about Israel among three generations.
*  And the oldest generation, which essentially is the presidents, is extremely sympathetic,
*  I think, to these Israelis still in the founding moment, 1948, probably through 67, Israel
*  is David, Israel is democracy.
*  It's a special relationship.
*  And I think the president's still there.
*  My guess is, more than my guess, younger people in the administration feel differently.
*  And that's also, by the way, at the risk of getting ahead of ourselves, something of a
*  warning I would suggest to the Israelis.
*  Joe Biden's reluctance to take on Israel is not the future.
*  In some ways, it's the past.
*  And one of the things that I'm most worried about, because I care about this relationship,
*  is at times the cavalier approach, the Israeli leadership acts towards this relationship,
*  assuming that it will remain special, assuming that Israel will always have a degree of freedom
*  that no other ally or partner of the United States enjoys.
*  I don't agree.
*  I don't see that.
*  So I think there's a shortsightedness there that potentially will come back to haunt Israel.
*  I want to come back to your idea that Joe Biden should do what Bibi Netanyahu has done
*  and go around Netanyahu and give a speech directly to the Israeli Knesset, which is
*  their version of our Congress.
*  What would you want him to say in that speech?
*  It's essential that the president of the United States stand up and say, I'm sympathetic to
*  what you're doing.
*  Draw the parallel, say, to 9-11.
*  But then he says, we overreached after 9-11, and that led to Iraq, and we paid an enormous
*  price.
*  So it's understandable that you want to do what your government is doing, but from where
*  I sit, and I'm sympathetic, I'm even empathetic, I also am critical.
*  I just don't think it will work.
*  And I would go through the logic, or if you will, illogic, of some of the Israeli position,
*  the idea that you can eliminate Hamas, that you can only bring to a situation military
*  instruments and not have political instruments.
*  It's almost as if Klausivitz was never translated into Hebrew.
*  Where is the political dimension of Israeli policy?
*  And the president can sympathize and say, look, what happened was barbaric.
*  I understand all the opportunities the Palestinians have had in the past.
*  I would say, is make the case why Israel's policy is not in the long-term interest of
*  Israel.
*  If you want it to be a secure, prosperous, Jewish, democratic state, occupation can't
*  go on forever.
*  Why it's not in the interest of the US-Israeli relationship.
*  He would talk about the various conditions and tests that would be presented to Palestinians.
*  He wouldn't be saying up and even necessarily even mention to State Solicitor General, only
*  to say, I think that's the ultimate thing.
*  I understand that you're not ready for it.
*  Well, let me talk about some of the conditions or tests the Palestinians would have to meet.
*  So I think the president, how would I put it?
*  If I had to choose his approach, he would take his lead from Itzach Rabin, not Shimon
*  Peres.
*  Itzach Rabin was a reluctant peacemaker.
*  And as a result, he could bring the body politic of Israel along.
*  When he said, this isn't easy for me, Israelis got it.
*  Shimon Peres was never really successful because he was an enthusiastic peacemaker.
*  So I think President Biden has to sympathize, empathize with the Israelis, but point out
*  the error of their ways, present an alternative trajectory, but reassure them it's not going
*  to be imposed on them.
*  Here's the test that will be applied and make the case that if we can get there, that is
*  far, far better for Israel than the alternative of not getting there.
*  You've been lobbying the administration directly on doing this.
*  What has been their response to you?
*  I believe there's considerable sympathy on the idea of the president giving a major speech,
*  probably not going to the Knesset, but giving a major speech before some audience here in
*  the United States.
*  The administration is also now circulating its own draft resolutions.
*  Not quite clear to me whether they really intend to go forward with it or it's a bit
*  of leverage against the Israeli government.
*  I don't get the sense that they're prepared yet to put conditions on military aid, though
*  I think they could on its use.
*  They've introduced the sanctions.
*  I don't get the sense they're prepared to broaden economic sanctions yet.
*  But these things are being talked about.
*  The last four or five months have, I think, brought home to most senior people in the
*  administration, not to mention a lot of junior people in the administration, that our policy
*  isn't working.
*  I just come back from the Persian Gulf.
*  It's not just that Israel is radicalizing a new generation of Arabs who couldn't care
*  less about Palestinians six months ago.
*  Suddenly the Palestinian cause has been reawakened in the Middle East.
*  It's not just that Israel is slightly poisoning its own relationship with the Arab world,
*  but we are losing standing everywhere I went.
*  This is a really toxic combination for America's reputation because we're seen as not standing
*  by certain friends who deserve us and we're standing by too uncritically by others.
*  That is a really bad combination for the position of the United States and the world.
*  When I've thought about this Knesset idea and Joe Biden giving a speech like this, one
*  of the things I wonder about with it is whether in American politics we sufficiently appreciate
*  or take seriously how right-wing Israeli politics has really become.
*  They don't like Netanyahu anymore.
*  He has failed them.
*  They would like to see other leadership.
*  Benny Gantz is a more reasonable person than Netanyahu.
*  But in terms of the things that are dominant beliefs among US policymakers, particularly
*  things like the only answer to this is a two-state solution that Palestinians should be responsible
*  for governing the West Bank and Gaza.
*  It's not just that Netanyahu disagrees with us now, but that the Israeli center disagrees
*  with it now.
*  I saw a poll not long ago that asked Israelis if supporting a two-state solution was a cost
*  of keeping American support for Israel, should Israeli support a two-state solution or they
*  should give up on American support for Israel?
*  A majority, a solid majority said give up on American support for Israel.
*  That's been a question in my mind that when you're talking about Shimon Peres and Yitzhak
*  Rabin, when I talk to people who work on this issue and have worked on it for a very long
*  time and I talk to them about who they talk to, right?
*  And these are all people who know it so much better than I do.
*  I always get a bit of a sense that their contacts, like the people they know are not the people
*  in power anymore, by and large.
*  That like there's a desire to work with the Israeli government of 2007, but not really
*  a plan for what to do with the Israeli polity of 2024.
*  I'm smiling because I tend to agree with you.
*  I think a lot of Americans, particularly American Jews, have this view of Israel, which
*  is Paul Newman in Exodus.
*  It's Ari Ben-Kanan and it's outdated.
*  It's a liberal, Western-oriented Israel.
*  And that just ignores the demographic shifts and the policy shifts within Israel.
*  There's no longer a labor party to speak of.
*  This Israel is qualitatively different.
*  So I don't argue your basic point that Israel has shifted dramatically to the right for
*  all sorts of political and demographic reasons.
*  It has to do also with the influx of refugees from places like Russia, the large families
*  of the ultra-Orthodox, the emigration of a lot of the startup nation people to this country.
*  So all of that has made for a much more right-wing Israel.
*  That said, Bibi Netanyahu, to me, has failed one of the first tests of leadership.
*  He is following public opinion.
*  Where has he challenged public opinion in the wake of October 7th?
*  The great leaders in history, whether it's the Churchills, the FDRs, what have you, they
*  don't just follow public opinion polls.
*  So if you thought that what Israel is doing is understandable but perhaps counterproductive,
*  a real leader would take it on.
*  I haven't noticed one ounce of that from Bibi Netanyahu.
*  Also if we ever do use the phrase two-state solution, it has become so freighted with
*  symbolism, we've got to be really careful and make it clear that it's not unconditional.
*  It's got to be demilitarized.
*  It only comes about in stages.
*  And we've got to remember that Israel has post-traumatic stress disorder and it should,
*  collectively.
*  And we've got to understand that as we approach it if we want to bring it along.
*  We can't rush it and we can't jam them.
*  But we do have to begin that conversation because left to its own devices, this is not
*  going to end up well.
*  This is not going to end up well for Palestinians, for Israelis, or for Americans.
*  And what I'm most worried about is that rather than this crisis being midwife to something
*  better, that this crisis will be a midwife to more drift.
*  And what I like to call or hate to call the one-state non-solution, that's the most likely
*  outcome where you have an open-ended war, low-level war in Gaza, and you have continued
*  settlement of the occupied territories and the Israeli-American relationship grows more
*  distant, particularly among younger Americans.
*  That is not a good outcome.
*  But left to its own devices, that's where we're heading.
*  There's an argument out there that I've been mauling that the problem with American policy
*  or one of them is that we don't accept this dark one-state reality that exists now where
*  you in fact do have Israel in control of the West Bank, in control of Gaza.
*  In Foreign Affairs, Mark Lynch and Shibley Talhami have this interesting piece on this,
*  and they're talking here about what the aim of U.S. policy should be.
*  They write, U.S. policy should be centered not on implausible efforts to revive talks
*  of unachievable outcomes, by which I mean the two-state solution right now, but on forcefully
*  spelling out the legal and human rights standards it expects to be met.
*  What do you think of that?
*  I disagree.
*  I read the piece, as you would expect, from the former president of the Council on Foreign
*  Relations.
*  I have to read, enjoy reading, and learn from foreign affairs.
*  They've given up on the two-state solution.
*  We may get there, and that's a different conversation, but I'm not there.
*  And I think it's a mistake.
*  To paraphrase Churchill, the two-state solution is the worst possible approach to the Israeli-Palestinian
*  issue except for all the others.
*  So we ought not to give up on it.
*  We ought to think about how we can bring it about on terms that would be acceptable
*  to both Palestinians and Israelis.
*  I think the Saudi willingness to normalize relations with Israel potentially gives us
*  some incentive, some leverage to work with.
*  I think it's way premature and counterproductive to adopt the position that the two-state solution's
*  dead.
*  It might be on life support, but it's not dead.
*  And the real question is, can we revive it?
*  There was a piece in the same issue of the magazine by Martin Indyk, which said this
*  is a strange reaction, but you're now seeing the resurrection of the idea.
*  And I think the reason you are seeing the resurrection of the idea is people have looked
*  into the abyss, an open-ended war in Gaza and continued settlement of the occupied territories.
*  And now you have the right wing in Israel talking about transfer of Palestinians out
*  of these areas and so forth.
*  It would destabilize the region, and it would basically put Israel on a perpetual war footing.
*  It would give Iran tremendous leverage and tools to work with.
*  Why is that in anyone's interest?
*  So I don't want to have the conversation about how to make what I call the one-state non-solution
*  better.
*  I think the focus ought to be still on, can we revive a two-state approach?
*  One of the things that I think is interesting in their argument is it gets us away from
*  a problem in the two-state conversation, which is that in the two-state conversation, because
*  Israelis have a state and Palestinians do not, it becomes about all this conditionality
*  on what Palestinians have to do to earn this thing that Israelis already have.
*  So you've mentioned this a bit yourself.
*  It should be demilitarized.
*  How is it governed?
*  What is the condition of the Palestinian authority?
*  But the structure of that, it has all this conditionality on Palestinians.
*  And one thing I think makes our role in this look quite unfair to the world is that we
*  don't impose a lot of conditionality on the Israelis.
*  So the fact that the settlements are functionally legal under international law, it's something
*  that we've mostly just given up on.
*  We're not withholding our aid because of it.
*  Occasionally, the president will lament that it is true, but we have no plan for rolling
*  it back.
*  And so one thing I find somewhat appealing about these more behavioral approaches as
*  opposed to imagining a final state settlement is it focuses us a little bit more and a little
*  bit more neutrally on the behavior of both sides in the here and now and allows us maybe
*  to act as a more honest broker with more equal standards.
*  But you have to stop doing certain things.
*  We can't go from where we are to two states.
*  But the thrust of U.S. policy should have been and should be and now and going forward
*  to preserve the option of a two-state solution.
*  And we have been lax to a fault in looking the other way.
*  It's almost as if we had a settlement resistance fatigue.
*  We got rolled.
*  And it wasn't easy to stand up to it.
*  I remember when I worked again for Bush, the father, and I was his Middle East advisor
*  at the White House to stand up on those issues was politically brutal.
*  I actually think now it wouldn't be as brutal because the domestic context here, the political
*  balance has shifted in this country and the debate about Israel.
*  But no, we should our position should be nothing should be done that prejudices the possibility
*  of a two-state outcome.
*  That means for Palestinians, we push back on things like violence.
*  We insist on good government, not necessarily democracy, but a degree of good government.
*  And I think in the Israelis, we've got to push back on all sorts of settlement creation
*  and expansion.
*  And then we have to think about what's the appropriate responses if and when our position
*  is flouted.
*  Yes, that's what American foreign policy should be willing to do here.
*  The other major crisis that has occupied Biden's term has been Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  We're ending year three of that war.
*  Where is it?
*  Well, the glass half full would say what an extraordinary accomplishment that this country
*  Even one third the population of Russia, a military that's a fraction of Russia's has
*  essentially held its own over the last two years.
*  Russia's net gain of territory last two years is negligible.
*  They're essentially where they were after 2014 holding Crimea and the East and Ukraine
*  with substantial help from the United States.
*  And Europe has done remarkably well in more than holding its own, inflicting great damage
*  on the Russian forces.
*  Just a glass half full.
*  Glass half empty is Ukraine has paid an enormous price for this economically.
*  Just the other day, President Zelensky talked about 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers lost their
*  lives.
*  Those numbers, many people think are low.
*  I don't know how many injured, perhaps more worrisome as you and everyone listening to
*  this knows in the last few weeks, we're beginning to see some discernible shifts on the battlefield.
*  continues to throw enormous mass at the battle, both people and equipment and ammunition and
*  Ukraine lacks it just more than anything lacks the ammunition.
*  And even though Ukraine has moved, which people like me argued for for some time into defensive
*  stances, which require less in the way of resources, they're still increasingly overwhelmed.
*  So they're beginning to lose some towns.
*  We'll see where that goes from here.
*  And the psychological trend has changed.
*  We've been having this conversation nine months ago.
*  At the beginning, say of the second year of the war, there was all sorts of anticipation
*  about the counteroffensive.
*  What could Ukraine accomplish?
*  People like me were skeptical, but so be it.
*  That's a very different conversation than we're having now.
*  Now the feeling is almost what the Soviets used to call the correlation of forces is
*  slightly shifted against Ukraine for any other reason because of us.
*  Not that they've gotten worse at fighting, not that the Europeans have gotten less supportive.
*  So that's where we are now.
*  And so the question is, I think year three, by the end of this fighting season, the map
*  looks somewhat like pretty much like it looks now, probably somewhat in the Russians favor
*  couple of percent, maybe more of territory.
*  I don't mean to be cavalier because that's people's lives and towns, but the Russians
*  will pick up the big variable is still USAID, whether it's forthcoming at any point, if
*  it is, it will stop the Russian gain.
*  So I don't think anything decisive will happen on the battlefield.
*  I don't think anything will happen diplomatically, but all things being equal, I expect you'll
*  see modest Russian gains as the year goes on.
*  That aid, there's a $60 billion bill stuck right now in the House.
*  The expectation is if Speaker Johnson would bring it to a vote, it would pass.
*  It would pass in a bipartisan way.
*  The expectation is Speaker Johnson will not bring it to a vote.
*  How would you describe where Republicans have moved on Ukraine and what their policy is?
*  What is the strongman version of how Republicans see this right now?
*  It's a full disclosure.
*  I was a Republican for 40 years.
*  I left the Republican Party about three years ago, though I often quote Ronald Reagan, I
*  don't feel I left the party.
*  I felt the party left me.
*  And this is one of the principal chapters and verses as to why the Republican Party
*  went from the most internationalist and often willing to have a dimension of military force
*  in American foreign policy now to being isolationist.
*  It's also quite critical of allies.
*  And then on top of that, you've got this bizarre romance with Russian authoritarianism that
*  seems to be an extension of the former president more than anything else, but no one seems
*  willing or able to stand up to him.
*  I think the arguments I've heard on the Republican side, I guess there are a couple and I don't
*  agree with them.
*  I'll just articulate them.
*  One is where the war in Ukraine, we're focusing on the wrong place.
*  Either we should focus at home, classic butter versus guns, or we should focus on China and
*  the potential threat to Taiwan.
*  So I see two groups of Republicans opposing this focus geographically.
*  Some might have a third, we should focus on helping Israel or taking on Iran.
*  That is basically the wrong geopolitical focus.
*  There's also some criticism of Ukraine that you see this from Senator Vance and that there's
*  a little bit that we're pouring good money after bad that Ukraine's definition of success
*  can never be met.
*  So why are we contributing to a policy that is destined to fail?
*  And that's where I think, by the way, the friends of Ukraine haven't done it any favors.
*  All this talk about complete military liberation of Russian controlled territory.
*  It's not that it's not desirable.
*  It's not that it's not right.
*  It's just not going to happen.
*  So it's always a mistake in foreign policy or in life to define success in terms you
*  can't meet because it gives those who have no interest in that, it gives them a pretty
*  good argument.
*  So we're seeing that.
*  But I haven't heard anything else.
*  I think it's basically classic isolationism.
*  In some cases, they've got a different set of foreign policy priorities.
*  Or in some cases, they simply think this policy can't succeed.
*  So why should we fund it?
*  Let me pick up on that last point.
*  So I was watching Jake Sullivan on Unmeet the Press over the weekend.
*  But at the end of the day, Ukraine still has the capacity, if we provide them the tools
*  and resources they need to be able to prevail in this war.
*  And it is up to us, the United States and our allies and partners, to deliver on our
*  commitments.
*  And that's why it's so important that Congress act.
*  Zelensky's view is that Ukraine will win.
*  It will get its territory back.
*  And nothing less than that is acceptable.
*  And Sullivan's argument was that victory is possible.
*  And it is possible so long as America keeps funding Ukrainian counteroffensives, giving
*  it the weaponry it needs.
*  Victory might have been more possible, may still be more possible, if we really did open
*  the spigot of all weapons.
*  Right. But we're not doing that.
*  I was having some trouble with this because of somebody I would like to see this aid pass.
*  I also didn't really believe that Jake Sullivan believed victory is possible if we did
*  the aid. And I'm not, you know, it might have been a little more couch than that, but
*  that's what he was saying.
*  And so there is a way and I feel in some ways echoes some of the things happening with
*  Netanyahu in the administration, where it's like we, you know, we like Zelensky a lot
*  better than we like Netanyahu, but we're a little bit yoked to him.
*  And it's very hard for us to say something different than what he is saying.
*  But what he is saying, I think, is no longer believed that the goal is achievable.
*  And we've not really articulated now a different policy.
*  We're just sort of putting money into his policy.
*  What should our policy be?
*  Like, how do we manage a situation like that where we support Ukraine, but maybe have a
*  different view of what is now realistic?
*  So a couple of reactions.
*  At the risk of agreeing with you too much, you're essentially right here.
*  And for two years now, the administration has basically said our policy is whatever
*  Ukraine wants.
*  And I've argued against that from the get go privately and publicly and said to people
*  since when is that American foreign policy?
*  We should do what we think is desirable, but also achievable.
*  We've got to look at the entire world.
*  This is not the only consideration and we can't set ourselves up for failure.
*  So I think the idea that Ukraine is going to was or is going to militarily liberate
*  is not going to happen.
*  It's just beyond their capability.
*  And I've never suggested though that Ukraine should give up the ultimate goal of
*  complete liberation.
*  But who said that has to be done through military tools?
*  That could be done diplomatically.
*  Indeed, my view is if they can hold their own and fight Russia to a draw, which they've
*  been doing, I think the day will come probably under a post-Putin or a post-post-Putin
*  leadership where that conversation can happen.
*  And you could have now the best we can have as a stalemate, maybe a ceasefire or an
*  armistice down the road.
*  I think you could potentially have a peace agreement, but that's not with Putin.
*  It's with some future Russian leader who might want Russian reintegration into Europe
*  and the West.
*  It's one of the reasons by the way, I want to save those frozen assets as an incentive
*  one day for that Russian.
*  That's the money we frozen of Russians abroad.
*  Yeah, about $300 billion in Western financial institutions.
*  And some people are saying give it to Ukraine now.
*  My view is when I want to save it as leverage down the road to what Ukraine needs now is
*  not money to rebuild.
*  It needs arms.
*  This won't help them.
*  I think it's somewhat tangential to their immediate need.
*  So I think the administration has been unwilling to look, what's the word, insufficiently
*  supportive of Ukraine.
*  They're worried that they're going to get criticized.
*  But I think their position was and is untenable.
*  I think we make a larger point in foreign policy.
*  We spend so much time thinking about how do we deal with our adversaries and we have a
*  whole playbook for that balance of power, military tools, negotiations, arms control,
*  sanctions.
*  Okay.
*  What's interesting is how much less developed is the foreign policy playbook or toolkit,
*  whatever phrase you want to use for dealing with friends.
*  And here we are with we just spent some time talking about one friend Israel.
*  Now we're talking about another friend Ukraine.
*  And in both cases, we're not exactly in the same place.
*  We're very different place with this Israeli government.
*  So the question there is how do we support Israel without supporting Israeli policy?
*  Very hard to deal to navigate that.
*  And with Ukraine, we don't have as much problems with the leadership, but it's not going to
*  work.
*  So again, how do we be supportive without giving them a blank check, particularly given
*  the critique that why are you asking us to fund a policy that can't succeed?
*  So I think in both cases, the administration, particularly in Ukraine, it's been directionally
*  right, the Biden administration policy, but it's for way too long been unwilling to have
*  the tough honest conversation.
*  Hey, this isn't going to work.
*  And again, as we discussed before with Israel, I think there has to be both privately and
*  publicly a greater willingness almost to strike out on an independent path.
*  One thing that scares me in the politics of foreign policy right now is I think that
*  there is a distance between the somewhat high minded and somewhat legitimate arguments
*  you will hear from congressional Republicans on Ukraine aid right now, which have validity
*  and what is actually happening in the party on Ukraine.
*  What is actually happening when Donald Trump says, if our friends don't give enough to
*  NATO, all that Russia do whatever the hell they want.
*  What is actually happening when Tucker Carlson until like 25 minutes ago, the most important
*  media figure on the right is going giving these slavish interviews with Vladimir Putin
*  and being like they have bread in Russian grocery stores.
*  Can you imagine that bread?
*  What is actually happening when Republicans are knowingly being part of what is a Russian
*  election op in what they're doing with Hunter Biden in the house?
*  Like this has all come out.
*  We now know we were getting disinformation from Russian agents, but they just sort of
*  quietly delete that from their list of particulars.
*  There's no soul searching on what's actually going on there.
*  And so there's this thing happening where on the one hand you have a Republican Party
*  that seems to have a lot of tendrils reaching out towards Russia.
*  You then have another part of the party afraid of crossing that part of the party.
*  This trying to figure out a reasonable policy description of why it's going to do what
*  Russia would kind of like and not give this aid to Ukraine.
*  And then on top of that, you have Donald Trump who is wrapping this in both some crazy
*  commentary as is often his want, but then a sort of neo isolationist guns and butter
*  argument that I will say in my just travels and reporting and talking to people about
*  the elections, I feel is resonating.
*  I feel there is a resonance of his.
*  This is a mess.
*  Why are we spending this money over here?
*  America's crumbling and broken.
*  It's not my view of America or our fiscal reality, but it feels like there is some
*  energy in it and that this needs some kind of defense and there isn't a very good one
*  because there isn't a way to wedge out the kind of fake Republican arguments from the
*  real Republican arguments.
*  So two things.
*  I felt a little bit uncomfortable when you asked me to talk about the Republican
*  defenses of their opposition to aid to Ukraine because I didn't want to dignify them.
*  And you that's what you got out just now that yes, there are serious arguments for
*  opposing some aid to Ukraine, whether it's because we want to focus on helping Taiwan
*  or this isn't going to work or what have you.
*  But that's not an argument for opposing all aid to Ukraine.
*  If the Republicans were serious and saying we can't put so many eggs in the basket, then
*  the conversation would be okay.
*  If you don't want to put a dozen eggs in the basket, what about 10?
*  What about nine?
*  What would be a serious where we don't lose Ukraine and all its accomplice?
*  I don't see Republicans saying that.
*  If they wanted to have a foreign policy conversation, we could have it about how to
*  reallocate US resources, but they're not because no serious foreign policy conversation
*  would say no aid to Ukraine.
*  So this is not a foreign policy position.
*  This is one totally born of domestic politics.
*  Partially the isolationism that's always there.
*  Partially just Donald Trump, which again also reflects this bizarre right-wing
*  Republican fascination with Putin's anti-woke, homophobic, Christian, white Russia.
*  There's something going on there that I don't pretend to understand, but it resonates
*  clearly in some circles.
*  On the isolationism, look, it's always there.
*  It's never that far from the surface.
*  And by the way, it's Republicans don't own it.
*  It's in the Democratic Party too.
*  It's everywhere.
*  And on one hand, it's kind of attractive.
*  Well, why should we be doing so much over there when we have all these problems over
*  here?
*  And then you've got to explain and anytime you're explaining in politics, you're behind.
*  But there are real explanations.
*  Well, we've learned that what we do over there can be good in and of itself.
*  Plus it can help us.
*  There's those arguments.
*  What we're doing over there in the way of spending on defense, as big as it is, is
*  probably what 50 or 60 percent the Cold War average of what we spent as a percentage of
*  our GDP on defense.
*  And I think we learned during the Cold War that we can have both guns and butter.
*  Also, you have to explain to people that the problem with what ails us domestically and
*  there's many things, it's not because of a lack of spending.
*  We spend twice the OECD average, twice the advanced industrial country average on
*  health care.
*  But the last I checked, Americans aren't twice as healthy and they don't live twice as
*  long. So how much we spend is not necessarily the critical thing.
*  It's how we spend it.
*  So let's have a serious conversation about how we spend our money domestically and so
*  forth. You want to get serious about budgetary issues, you've got to talk about
*  entitlements. Last I checked, Donald Trump and Republicans don't want to talk about
*  entitlement.
*  So I think you can engage the conversation on isolationism, but it's not a simple or
*  easy one.
*  And you've got to talk about it, both the case for involvement over there and why what
*  we're doing over there is not responsible for the border issue or the lack of quality
*  of schools or health care costs.
*  But it ain't an easy conversation to win.
*  The foreign policy conversation to me right now feels more confusing and opaque than at
*  other times I can remember covering it in the sense that it sometimes feels like neither
*  side can actually say what the real foreign policy is.
*  So Republicans for the reasons we've just discussed and the Democrats a bit because a
*  lot of our foreign policy is being set in a real way by difficult allies by Netanyahu,
*  by Zelensky.
*  I think Biden can be more honest about his foreign policy and others can and there's
*  been an extremely strong set of arguments made by the administration about what our
*  foreign policy is towards China and how it understands strategic competition.
*  Right. If you go back to, you know, all these Jake Sullivan speeches, they actually
*  represent a pretty big effort to shift American foreign policy positioning.
*  But when it comes to the issues, the crises that are in Americans faces every day that
*  are leading the news every day, they're much more constrained in a way unlike what
*  they're willing to say and what they're willing to do because they are trying to be
*  supportive to allies they do not control.
*  So you have this sort of weird thing with Republicans have public and private
*  rationales and sometimes I think a lot of just fear of crossing Donald Trump.
*  And so it's not really an engaged debate on that side in a way where you can argue
*  with things people are saying and feel like you are arguing with the thing that you
*  are actually confronting.
*  And on the Democratic side, I actually don't feel somebody follows this quite closely
*  that the Biden administration is really articulating a strategy on a bunch of these
*  things now. I mean, they're you can kind of like figure out what it is, but it is
*  just become complicated as they are in this delicate dance with their partners.
*  And so it's made for I think a very strange debate.
*  It's not just that they're in a delicate dance with their partners.
*  I think they're also in a delicate situation in terms of domestic politics.
*  But there's some difference between the two.
*  I think what explains the administration's reticence to take on Israel more directly
*  is the president.
*  He's just not there and he is uncomfortable doing it.
*  He's edging in that direction.
*  And here we are February turning into March and he's now farther along that path than
*  he was in October and November.
*  But he's somewhere along that path.
*  But my guess is he will gradually move in that direction of more distance between the
*  United States and Israel and more what I would call an independent American foreign
*  policy rather than a foreign policy that's only trying to persuade Israel to act
*  differently.
*  I think in Ukraine the administration long ago realized that Zelensky's goals were
*  unrealizable.
*  It wasn't they weren't desirable.
*  Of course they're desirable.
*  You just can't get from here to there and not by the way, I think because they were
*  reluctant to provide certain arms.
*  I think that's exaggerated even if they had done it.
*  I don't think it would have turned the tide.
*  But I just think they were worried about looking insufficiently supportive of an ally
*  and they they held back but privately they understand.
*  That a definition of victory of complete military liberation is a non-starter.
*  That's why they're very comfortable with circumstances that are forced the Ukrainians
*  to shift to a much more defensive oriented strategy.
*  They'll get through this year.
*  I think there will be real diplomatic prospects.
*  The real question is whether Ukraine will be negotiating from position of strength or
*  weakness.
*  I do think diplomacy will ultimately come.
*  The administration didn't want to be seen as pushing a friend that was reluctant and
*  somehow selling them out when Ukraine could at least credibly claim that it was trying
*  to recover what was rightfully theirs in the interests of principles of world order that
*  we subscribe to.
*  The administration was just reluctant to take on that fight.
*  You said a second ago that part of what explains the reticence the sometimes opacity here is
*  domestic politics.
*  And I was thinking about whether or not that felt right to me and one of the I'm not sure
*  this analogy is right, but I want to try it out on you that these crises have a little
*  bit of a feeling to me of the way COVID politics changed over time.
*  There's a period and this is a period in which Joe Biden ran and the early part of his
*  administration in which a quite strict lockdown oriented distancing oriented obviously
*  than vaccines, maybe even vaccine mandates when that politics was very strong and it
*  took liberals.
*  It took Democrats some time when that politics had weakened because variants made it so the
*  vaccines stopped preventing transmission.
*  A set of things happen and people wanted to get back to their lives and liberals struggled
*  for a while to get into that phase of COVID right where they were sort of open enough
*  and it's felt to me a little bit like on Ukraine and then now more recently on on Israel
*  that Democrats or at least the Biden administration is a little bit stuck in phase one of
*  both conflicts that domestic politics.
*  It looks to me like where they are is actually unpopular and is causing real political
*  problems and actually opening space for Trump in a way that concerns me.
*  But it still feels very much like the first round on Israel, which is like Israel's been
*  attacked and we need you know, it has a right to defense and it is our ally and on Ukraine
*  a this is an unprovoked.
*  I mean, this is true still unprovoked aggression by Russia.
*  Russia needs to be stopped like the Ukrainian forces are heroic and our job is to help them
*  win and even as both of these now feel like they are in a different phase, it doesn't
*  really feel certainly from a communications level like our policies in that different
*  of a phase.
*  I would actually add another issue to the pattern you just set up, which is the border.
*  Where the administration policy is clearly not working.
*  I think it was originally adopted to placate a certain constituency within the Democratic
*  Party.
*  It's clearly failed.
*  It's alienating a much broader band of Americans to Mr.
*  Trump's advantage and the president is belatedly trying to adjust.
*  So I think that is quite similar to the pattern you just set out.
*  What's odd is that I think there is more scope for adjustment in all these cases than the
*  administration seems willing to entertain and I've thought about that a lot and because
*  the domestic politics now as opposed to 50 years ago being quote unquote tougher on Israel
*  would probably play better in terms of Ukraine must liberate every square inch of territory
*  that Russia sitting on through military means.
*  I know that some of the individuals who are big advocates, but I once while I sort of
*  say who are the real friends of Ukraine?
*  Is that a wise path to insist on?
*  So I don't think the president would pay an enormous price if he said look, we support
*  Ukraine.
*  We've done all this.
*  We're going to continue to help them.
*  But on the other hand, we can't get from here to there doesn't mean we're selling them
*  out.
*  It means we have to adjust what it is we do on there.
*  We have so I actually think the administration has more scope and then the question is and
*  you're getting at it.
*  Why don't they take advantage of it?
*  And is it sort of the Washington bubble that they're so worried about what a couple of
*  members of the foreign policy elite will say or what a couple of columnists will say or
*  what a couple of Republicans might say?
*  My guess is they exaggerate the price of angering some of the critics of looking unprincipled
*  or quote unquote being charged with selling out your friends.
*  My guess is if you're willing to do something and explain it and explain it again and it
*  has real substance and merit to it.
*  My sense is you can bring most of the American people along with you.
*  This is a place where I do think a different form of domestic politics has created a set
*  of problems.
*  I'm glad you brought up immigration in the border because I think that's an interesting
*  case study from this perspective.
*  It's such an interesting issue because I've talked to the Biden administration a fair
*  amount about this and this is not an issue where they're saying Republicans are
*  the ones who have invented a problem.
*  They will sit down in front of you and say our asylum process is completely broken.
*  It's a disaster.
*  We need to do something about it right now.
*  And so they back the Murphy, you know, bipartisan negotiations led on the Democratic
*  side by Senator Chris Murphy, which was a big shift rightward on immigration policy
*  for the Democrats that has in that instance in the Senate, Republican support and is
*  then killed by Donald Trump.
*  And one of the things that I think is difficult for them in some ways.
*  With where the Republican Party has gone.
*  Is that it is useful to have bipartisan structures in which you can make your adjustments
*  into policy.
*  So you could imagine the Republican Party we're talking about that has only the high
*  minded objections to Ukraine negotiating out with the administration money that in both
*  rhetorical ways and substantive ways is attached to an admission that the strategy needs
*  to change that it's more defensive that we're not looking for a total victory anymore
*  that we're backing Ukraine up.
*  But we have a different kind of view on what's going on here.
*  But in practice Republicans are just kind of at a no.
*  Israel's more complicated.
*  We've had to decide for a minute.
*  But immigration.
*  I mean they did try to come to a deal where they did try to shift policy dramatically
*  and Republicans probably to Biden's political benefit just said no.
*  But it does mean that Biden then cannot say look we actually did this like people were
*  right.
*  This was a problem and we solved it and that inability in a divided government to make
*  policy adjustment through bipartisan compromise.
*  It does feel like a very significant challenge.
*  A hundred percent the Republicans have ceased to be a party of governance or co-governance.
*  Everything is politics and only politics.
*  But I think there's a difference between the two issues of the border and Ukraine on Ukraine.
*  The president can't get the aid approved without the House of Representatives.
*  That's a fact of life.
*  So there I think he has to simply be prepared to use the bully pulpit more and it's not his
*  strength quite honestly.
*  But the president has to be willing to spell it out and spell it out and spell it out again
*  and press conferences and addresses.
*  Think of FDR taking a reluctant America closer to entry into World War II through fireside
*  chats.
*  It takes sustained public conversation.
*  The Oval Office is potentially a great classroom.
*  The president is potentially the teacher in chief.
*  This president is not comfortable in that role and that's a real shortcoming.
*  And I say this as someone who's you know on Ukraine for example I think he's gotten it
*  more right than not.
*  But he can't get to where he needs to get without the House of Representatives.
*  That'll only happen through public opinion essentially penalizing them for this position.
*  The border he's if he can't do the same thing there then he's got to do more things unilaterally.
*  He's got some executive authority challenge challenge the Republicans to stop him challenge
*  the courts to say he can't do it.
*  I think there's much more he could do on the border issue both rhetorically but more important
*  substantively and he just has to be willing to do it and stare down his own left.
*  It seems to me that a lot of the election is about to be fought on this question of
*  stability.
*  And I think this is something that people are not quite tracking in in Donald Trump
*  and his appeal.
*  It is something that in terms of the people Trump has running his campaign now who are
*  much more capable Republican operatives than he's had in the past and are known for trying
*  to turn the strength of the candidate they're facing in this case Joe Biden against him
*  that the argument Trump is going to be making the argument they kind of are making is that
*  Biden who represented stability who represented normalcy has not actually been able to
*  bring you stability and normalcy that prices went in all different directions right and
*  mostly up that the border is overrun.
*  I think that is somewhat but not totally invented certainly very hyped but it is real
*  and then we're in this morass in Ukraine people are upset about Israel and that the thing
*  that Joe Biden was here to offer a kind of stable world a world where you had competent
*  people in competent positions who were going to take care of things the world doesn't
*  feel that way to people the sort of ambient sense of chaos of crisis is a real problem
*  and that kind of ambient sense is always a opportunity for the strongman personality
*  which Trump has and while Trump has his own challenges as a person for presenting any
*  kind of calm or predictability this seems like a real fight that's going to happen like
*  I think there's a good chance that the candidate who wins in 2024 is the one who Americans
*  trust to keep things kind of stable and I think there's an assumption on the Democratic
*  side that Trump cannot win a fight like that and I'm not sure now that he cannot win a
*  fight like that.
*  I think Biden's age does not help in this respect.
*  I think that he does not appear to people to be up to this whether he is or not is a
*  different question, but I think that's a real problem for them.
*  I'm curious how that tracks for you.
*  I'm with you except for the word stability.
*  I agree strongly that this is a populist moment to take Reagan's question.
*  Are you better off than you were four years ago?
*  Americans feel they don't feel they are without attributing causality.
*  If bad stuff happens on your watch and you're the incumbent you pay a price for it.
*  If good stuff happens on your watch, even if you don't deserve the credit you get it.
*  It's just correlation.
*  It's association.
*  So there's enough that's going wrong whether it's higher prices border issues several wars
*  this is not a good moment to run as a incumbent saying four more years doesn't really
*  resonate.
*  So it's a good moment for Trump or any outsider who represents a populist who represents
*  change and I don't think the argument would be stability in a funny sort of way what Trump
*  could do and it worries me because I think it has the potential of working someone of
*  resonating is saying we face real problems.
*  He'll attribute them all to Biden and he'll say and you need somebody like me.
*  You need a strong guy to fix them order order.
*  And that's the Orban code word for illiberalism that order no pun intended trumps everything
*  else and that Americans know there's something that's gone wrong in this country in the
*  difference in some ways between the parties is we have a very different set of prescriptions.
*  I travel around the country a lot speaking about American democracy and about what's
*  gone wrong with it, which I actually think has become our biggest national security threat
*  and whether the groups are to the left or the right people nod their heads.
*  They know something's wrong.
*  Something's gone off the rails.
*  And what worries me is those who are selling the snake oil of order even at shall we say
*  the cost of certain Democratic rights that there might be an audience for that there
*  might be a market for that and I think that's the danger as we head into November.
*  I think that's a good place to end.
*  So is our final question.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  I'm glad you asked that question.
*  First is a book by Ben Steele former colleague of mine at the Council on Foreign Relations
*  and economic historian who's written a book recently published called the world that wasn't
*  Henry Wallace and the fate of the American century and Henry Wallace was FDR's third
*  vice president and if he had been his fourth vice president or if FDR had died before the
*  end of his third term history would have played out fundamentally differently and the idea
*  that somebody with such a radical in this case pro-soviet sympathizer or worse fellow
*  traveler set of views could be literally a heartbeat away from the presidency was quite
*  extraordinary.
*  Second book also by a former colleague of mine at the Council on Foreign Relations in
*  this case Ian Johnson was one of this country's leading historians of China wrote a book
*  called sparks and the subtitle is China's underground historians and their battle for the
*  future and it's a story about these truly courageous Chinese historians who have fought
*  the party fought the leadership showing tremendous bravery and it's also it's fascinating
*  how much the party cares about history.
*  And you realize that the battle of history is not some arcane thing about the past the
*  battle over history is a political struggle for the present and future and it's just wonderfully
*  written third and last I got sent a manuscript out of the blue a few months ago about six
*  months ago and someone said I thought you might be interested in this book.
*  I don't know about you.
*  I get a lot of these and I was going to put it aside but I thought I recognized the name
*  and the subject matter intrigued me and what it was about was two diplomats who became
*  the ambassador and the deputy chief of mission at the American Embassy in Saigon in the early
*  60s and the books called diplomats at war friendship and betrayal on the brink of the
*  Vietnam conflict was just published about two weeks ago by Charles Trueheart and it's
*  just a great foreign policy story of bureaucratic infighting regime change.
*  And what do you do coming back to the conversation of today?
*  What is the United States do when it has strategic interests as it sees them and it doesn't
*  have a person it sees as a partner.
*  So I found it such a timely book unexpectedly so really nicely done.
*  Richard Hoss.
