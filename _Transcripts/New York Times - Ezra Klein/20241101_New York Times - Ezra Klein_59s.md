# Vivek Ramaswamy Reacts to Why Ann Coulter Wouldn't Vote for Him
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-YFw6HcIxM)
*  There was a part of your book that I found moving or sad that you'd had this interaction with Ann [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-YFw6HcIxM&t=0.0s)]
*  Coulter where I guess she says to you, look, you're great. You're really impressive, but I [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-YFw6HcIxM&t=6.24s)]
*  wouldn't vote for you because you're quote, an Indian. You are so bright and articulate. And I [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-YFw6HcIxM&t=10.8s)]
*  guess I can call you articulate since you're not an American black, but I still would not have voted [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-YFw6HcIxM&t=15.6s)]
*  for you because you're an Indian. What was that moment like for you? My moment, my first moment [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-YFw6HcIxM&t=20.8s)]
*  was just like laughter. Like this sort of person who's this undereducated about what exactly are [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-YFw6HcIxM&t=26.32s)]
*  the qualifications to be a US president was amusing. I wasn't saying it was about qualifications. Well, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-YFw6HcIxM&t=31.68s)]
*  I think she was saying it in a literal sense about qualification. If you listen to what her [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-YFw6HcIxM&t=36.72s)]
*  justification is, if you haven't been here for enough generations and her view embedded in this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-YFw6HcIxM&t=40.4s)]
*  is that how American you are is a function of how many generations your bloodline is tied to the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-YFw6HcIxM&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  United States of America. And I reject that view. Actually, I think that a citizen is a citizen of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-YFw6HcIxM&t=50.8s)]
*  this country period. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-YFw6HcIxM&t=56.48s)]
