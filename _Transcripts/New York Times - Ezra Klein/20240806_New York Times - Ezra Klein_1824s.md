# How Tim Walz Went From Obscure Governor to Harris’s V.P. Pick
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=0.0s)]
*  It is Tuesday, August 6. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=23.32s)]
*  We just found out that Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, who we just did a show with [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=25.12s)]
*  a week ago, you can find it just back there in the archives, is going to be Kamala Harris' [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=29.86s)]
*  choice for vice president. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=34.86s)]
*  And so we now know what the shape of the race is. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  We have Donald Trump and JD Vance on one side, and we have Kamala Harris and Tim Walz on [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=39.72s)]
*  the other. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  And we've been covering this closely enough and talking about Walz enough that it felt [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=46.42s)]
*  like it would be good to just have a conversation about how this looks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=50.82s)]
*  So I'm joined, as I am so often in the cycle, by our great senior editor, Claire Gordon. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=54.98s)]
*  Claire? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=59.98s)]
*  Hi Ezra. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=60.98s)]
*  So I've seen Walz described as a unity pick, but he isn't exactly a moderate and Minnesota [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=61.98s)]
*  isn't exactly a swing state. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  So would you describe this as a safe choice or a bold choice? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=71.08s)]
*  I would describe Walz as clearly a bold choice. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=76.22s)]
*  So my friend Nate Silver, who I have been aligned with on most questions over the course [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=80.06s)]
*  of this campaign, has been making this argument that Shapiro would have been the bold choice. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=85.72s)]
*  And Shapiro would have been the bold choice because there's a little bit of friction with [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=90.58s)]
*  the left, potentially on Israel, maybe on some other questions. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=94.62s)]
*  But look, Shapiro has a 60% plus approval rating in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=100.0s)]
*  So far as any state in the country is likely to decide the election, Pennsylvania has the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  best shot at it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=109.9s)]
*  And so forget what the left is saying. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=111.76s)]
*  Pick the guy who's going to give you the best shot at winning the state you most need to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=115.10000000000001s)]
*  win. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=119.30000000000001s)]
*  I would say in that analysis, Shapiro is the safe choice. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  I don't think that there would have been static from the left in a way that would have been [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=124.18s)]
*  meaningful for the Harris campaign. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=126.86000000000001s)]
*  Democrats were quite united. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=128.86s)]
*  Shapiro's actual positions on Israel are not very different from Kamala Harris's, not very [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=130.66s)]
*  different from, frankly, any of the other vice presidential possibilities. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  Waltz emerges as a media phenomenon. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=139.62s)]
*  He is not an unknown figure. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=142.78s)]
*  He's the head of the Democratic Governors Association. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=145.22s)]
*  He's the governor of Minnesota, which is not a swing state, though it is worth noting that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=147.94s)]
*  in internal Democratic polling after Biden's collapse, Minnesota had become competitive. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=152.04s)]
*  But it's probably not with Harris under any of the vice presidential possibilities. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=157.02s)]
*  You know, Borders, Wisconsin, there's an argument that somebody like Waltz will be appealing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=162.26s)]
*  in Midwestern states. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't expect there to be a significant effect like that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=168.82s)]
*  But Waltz gives this interview on Morning Joe where he says that Trump and Vance are [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=172.57999999999998s)]
*  weird. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=179.62s)]
*  They're the kind of people who ruin Thanksgiving. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=180.62s)]
*  And in a minute, he functionally upends all Democratic messaging. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=182.78s)]
*  The Harris campaign begins to sound like him. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  Waltz goes on a media tour. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=189.94s)]
*  He's on CNN a bunch, MSNBC a bunch. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  He does an hour interview on the Ezra Klein Show. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=193.38s)]
*  I will say, by the way, I have interviewed a lot of politicians. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=197.02s)]
*  I don't know how many by now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=201.3s)]
*  I try to avoid doing it because politicians are terrible to interview. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  And Waltz is one of the five best politicians I've ever interviewed because he actually [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  thinks aloud. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=215.78000000000003s)]
*  He is responding to you in the moment in a genuine conversational way. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=217.68s)]
*  You can always tell with politicians this buffering happening in their heads. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=222.54s)]
*  You ask a question and this program fires up really fast. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=226.66s)]
*  It says, what are all the ways I could answer this wrong? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=230.18s)]
*  And what is my message here supposed to actually be? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=233.66s)]
*  And Waltz, you could feel the conversation actually happening. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=236.22s)]
*  It was like talking to a normal person, which is one reason he's so effective on TV. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=238.82s)]
*  But Waltz begins giving these interviews. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  He breaks through the media. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=246.2s)]
*  He breaks through the attentional field is what I would say. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=247.89999999999998s)]
*  Shapiro becomes a candidate who is most likely to help you win Pennsylvania. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=251.1s)]
*  Waltz becomes the vice presidential candidate, most likely to help you win the day to day [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=255.3s)]
*  fight for attention and message and enthusiasm. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=261.5s)]
*  And Harris picks Waltz, which I'm sure there are a lot of reasons she did so. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  But it is a pick about making the ticket most appealing nationally and trying to continue [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=271.44s)]
*  generating a momentum and energy that she has been generating to the surprise of many [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=278.46s)]
*  Democrats since the moment she became the presumptive nominee. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=283.9s)]
*  And that is a riskier play, but it is a bigger play. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=287.73999999999995s)]
*  It is a bet on the intangibles of the Harris ticket, not the tangible possibilities of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=291.34s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=296.58s)]
*  So the comparison that you see around to Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's 2016 pick, because [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=298.06s)]
*  they have similar affable dad vibes. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=303.94s)]
*  You don't think that's a fair comparison? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=308.02s)]
*  I think that comparison is insane. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=309.02s)]
*  And I don't understand the people. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=311.14s)]
*  Like, I've seen people who know a thing about politics making that comparison. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=312.58s)]
*  And it has made me question their judgment at fundamental level. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=318.5s)]
*  I like Tim Kaine. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=321.18s)]
*  Tim Kaine is a good man. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=322.9s)]
*  I've covered Tim Kaine for a long time. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=324.02s)]
*  Nobody can remember a thing Tim Kaine has ever said in public. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=326.94s)]
*  She is just not a memorable media figure. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=330.3s)]
*  The theory of a candidate like Tim Kaine was the theory of a good governing partner. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=333.98s)]
*  Hillary Clinton was very confident she was going to win the election. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=338.90000000000003s)]
*  She really liked Tim Kaine. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=342.02000000000004s)]
*  She felt that Tim Kaine in an election where she was trying to appear reassuring against [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=344.18s)]
*  the very unreassuring Donald Trump, Tim Kaine helped her do that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=348.62s)]
*  But she wasn't looking at Kaine to win her any states. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=353.48s)]
*  She wasn't looking at Kaine to be a kind of messenger she could not be. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=356.96s)]
*  She liked him. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=361.09999999999997s)]
*  It was a perfectly good pick for a perfectly good way of thinking about the vice president, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=362.09999999999997s)]
*  which is who do you think can best do the job if you die? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=366.2s)]
*  But what Walls is, again, is a media phenomenon. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  He also has a great record as a governor. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=377.82s)]
*  We can talk about some of that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  He could be a very significant governing partner in his ability to help Harris with particularly [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=380.96s)]
*  House Democrats where he served for some time and actually knows them and has a good sense [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=386.0s)]
*  of how the House works. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=389.92s)]
*  You can imagine that as one of the things in her head. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=391.34000000000003s)]
*  Tim Walls is a candidate who knows the House and he knows governors. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=394.16s)]
*  Those are two places that Harris does not herself have any kind of deep experience. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=397.32s)]
*  But that is not what vaulted Walls from being an obscure governor to becoming her vice president. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=402.6s)]
*  What vaulted Walls from being an obscure governor to her vice president was Walls broke through [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=410.68s)]
*  the cacophony of not just the campaign, but the post Harris moment, the run of every charismatic [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=416.24s)]
*  white male Democrat who thought he could be a possible vice presidential pick for Harris. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=427.46000000000004s)]
*  That's Buttigieg, that's Roy Cooper, that's Shapiro. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=434.5s)]
*  You could just run this list down. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=438.90000000000003s)]
*  That's Mark Kelly. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=440.5s)]
*  He broke through past all of them, reshaped the whole way people are talking about the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=442.18s)]
*  race, developed a rabid online fan base in a matter of days. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=446.78000000000003s)]
*  There's a certain segment of liberal leaning pundits or campaign strategists who act like [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=452.62s)]
*  attention is not a thing, who act like that whole mediating layer between what a candidate [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=462.5s)]
*  says and how they get heard doesn't exist. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=471.48s)]
*  And that the only thing that really matters are their demographic characteristics, the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=476.5s)]
*  state they are from, the kinds of policy positions they take. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=481.32s)]
*  But that's not true at all. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=486.74s)]
*  To compare it to Tim Kaine is to just miss the entire field on which Harris is currently [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=490.0s)]
*  thinking about playing, which is a field, by the way, that Joe Biden ceded to Donald [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=495.5s)]
*  Trump, which is a field of attention. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden's theory in 2020 and then again in 2024 was that the election should be about [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=502.12s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=507.68s)]
*  In 2020, when Donald Trump was the unpopular incumbent president, that was a theory that [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=509.0s)]
*  benefited Joe Biden hugely. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=516.16s)]
*  Donald Trump wanted the election to be about Donald Trump. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=518.16s)]
*  Joe Biden wanted to be about Donald Trump. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=520.2s)]
*  The election was about Donald Trump and Donald Trump lost. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=522.72s)]
*  In 2024, when Biden's communication skills had deteriorated and he was the unpopular [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=525.66s)]
*  incumbent president, making the election about Donald Trump, which was always the theory [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=531.9399999999999s)]
*  of the Biden campaign, was failing. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=537.02s)]
*  In part, it wasn't working because Biden's age had made the election too much about Biden's [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=539.86s)]
*  own competence. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=543.9399999999999s)]
*  But also people had become somewhat nostalgic, I think wrongly. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=545.38s)]
*  But nevertheless, for Donald Trump's economy, for a time before the war in Gaza, a time [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=549.26s)]
*  before the war in Ukraine, and Trump's existence was not repelling people in the way that [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=554.72s)]
*  strategy required him to do. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=561.76s)]
*  Harris, from the second she became the clear nominee, some intangible energy emerged [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=564.32s)]
*  around her to the extent that Republicans were so shocked by this vibe shift, they called [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=572.44s)]
*  it a Psi-Op, they pretended it's concocted, but no Democrat expected it either. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=576.84s)]
*  The whole Kamala is brat, the whole world of being coconut-pilled. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=582.1s)]
*  Harris has completely shouldered Trump out of his typical position of dominating the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=586.9s)]
*  media, dominating social media, dominating cable news. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=596.74s)]
*  It has become harder and harder for Trump to get a word in edgewise. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=600.62s)]
*  The main ways that Trump advance are breaking through are when they say outrageous, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=603.82s)]
*  unpopular things, which, by the way, was predictable. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=608.1s)]
*  It is what Donald Trump always does when he can't break through into the media. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=610.66s)]
*  He gets crazier and crazier until people begin to report on him again, which is an [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  excellent strategy for the Harris campaign. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=619.48s)]
*  But so they have begun dominating attentionally and they have picked a vice presidential [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=621.64s)]
*  candidate who is able to help them do that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=627.0s)]
*  A vice presidential candidate with a very, very clear capability to dominate in the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=630.4s)]
*  media. Now, whether or not that works all the way through, I don't know. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=635.68s)]
*  But that is the theory here. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=638.0s)]
*  That was not the Tim Kaine theory. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=639.0s)]
*  So just to underline this, you think weird won this for Walls? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=640.62s)]
*  I don't think there's any doubt. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=644.6999999999999s)]
*  And do you think weird is more than just a moment? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=646.4599999999999s)]
*  Do you think that's a sustainable message, a successful long-term message in this [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=650.9s)]
*  election? I think they could overdo it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=656.02s)]
*  If you go to the conversation I had with Walls, we talked a lot about that. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=658.06s)]
*  And I both think the weird messaging is very powerful. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=662.78s)]
*  And Walls is able to do it from a grounded place that other Democrats can't. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=667.36s)]
*  When he actually delivers that line the first time, not the first time he has ever [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=673.1600000000001s)]
*  delivered it, but where it broke through in the cycle, he talks about being from a [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=676.88s)]
*  small town of 400. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  He talks about there being no private schools in that town. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=682.24s)]
*  He talks about the way in which J.D. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=685.64s)]
*  Vance's effort to weaponize the resentment of rural Midwestern Appalachians [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=688.64s)]
*  and whites is inauthentic. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=697.48s)]
*  That that is not what people in small towns are like. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=700.88s)]
*  That people don't like that politics has become like this. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=703.4s)]
*  They don't want politics tearing their Thanksgiving dinner table apart. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=706.6800000000001s)]
*  Other Democrats picking up the weird thing, they can take it into a bit of a [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  schoolyard place. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=717.0400000000001s)]
*  Fine. So they have to be careful with that. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=718.6s)]
*  And I think Walls talks in that interview quite perceptively about how to be [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=720.84s)]
*  careful with it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=725.52s)]
*  But I do think he picks up there and that the Democrats have now understood this [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=726.7800000000001s)]
*  vulnerability in Trump and Vance in an important way. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=731.22s)]
*  And I would say it's actually a different vulnerability in the two of them. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=735.4200000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump is weird in a very particular way. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=739.0200000000001s)]
*  He's a person who you might ask, how will you make Social Security solvent? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=742.94s)]
*  And he might answer by lying about how many people were at his inauguration speech [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=748.0600000000001s)]
*  when he became president. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=753.7s)]
*  He's a narcissist. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=755.2s)]
*  His mind goes down very strange pathways. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=756.44s)]
*  I talked to somebody who worked with him where the guy was telling me what it's [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=759.36s)]
*  like to brief Donald Trump. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=762.84s)]
*  And he said, you just spend the whole hour chasing squirrels. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=764.76s)]
*  You tell him something and he just goes wherever he goes. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=769.2s)]
*  JD Vance, he's not weird. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=772.5600000000001s)]
*  He's off putting is the way I would put it. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=774.2s)]
*  And the particular problem with Vance is that he's too online. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=776.64s)]
*  Behind Donald Trump, where Donald Trump had a very authentic to Donald Trump form [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=781.1800000000001s)]
*  of weirdness, but it was a showman's weirdness. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=786.34s)]
*  It was a Barnum and Bailey weirdness. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=789.02s)]
*  Behind him emerged this very dark online set of subcultures. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=792.58s)]
*  I would call it the sort of extended MAGA online cinematic universe, but it has [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=798.42s)]
*  white supremacists in it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=802.86s)]
*  It has very weird forms of natalists in it, pro-natalists in it. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=804.26s)]
*  It has people who just are obsessed with race and immigration. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=808.24s)]
*  It has a neo reactionaries. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=814.4399999999999s)]
*  If you dig in to where the intellectual world that is following behind Donald Trump [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=816.4399999999999s)]
*  has gone, and we've, I've done a lot of this reading, it's bizarre. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=821.68s)]
*  And JD Vance, his conversion went through this online world. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=826.48s)]
*  What is weird about JD Vance is what is weird about somebody who spends too much [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=832.12s)]
*  time watching neo reactionary YouTube videos and then participating in the [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=835.6199999999999s)]
*  comment sections. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=840.5s)]
*  And that is why Vance has this completely unusual, particularly for vice presidential [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=842.38s)]
*  nominee, tendency to take a perfectly popular policy idea or insight about the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=849.2199999999999s)]
*  world and present it in the most unpopular off-putting possible way. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=854.3s)]
*  So when he comes out and says that childless people should pay a higher tax rate [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=858.9599999999999s)]
*  than people with children because you want to disincentivize bad things and [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=864.8399999999999s)]
*  incentivize good things. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=868.9599999999999s)]
*  In some way he's describing the child tax credit, which is a very popular policy [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=871.0s)]
*  supported by among other people, Kamala Harris, supported by among other people, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=876.8399999999999s)]
*  Tim Walz, not supported importantly by many congressional Republicans. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=881.12s)]
*  But you would never describe that policy in terms of punishing people without [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=886.7199999999999s)]
*  children. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=890.8s)]
*  You described that policy in terms of helping people with children. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=891.5799999999999s)]
*  When Vance is out there saying that people without children are more often [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=895.86s)]
*  deranged and sociopathic on Twitter, these things are natural in the world he was in [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=898.3s)]
*  where you are vying to show that you are most on the train. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=905.02s)]
*  He has described himself in this language. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=909.74s)]
*  It is very common out there as an anti-regime politician. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=911.9399999999999s)]
*  When you begin talking to those people like Patrick Deneen and these post-liberals, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=916.5799999999999s)]
*  they talk a lot about the regime, the sort of networked group of institutions, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=920.9599999999999s)]
*  media, government, business, et cetera, that dominates all American life. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=925.64s)]
*  And in this world, you have to show you're actually on board. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=929.8399999999999s)]
*  And the way you show it, and if you go to the Tucker Carlson interview where JD [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=934.12s)]
*  Vance makes his comment about Childless Cat Ladies, it's actually worth hearing [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=939.4399999999999s)]
*  the way Tucker Carlson opens that interview. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=943.04s)]
*  So there are two kinds of people who run for office and one category is really big, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=945.8399999999999s)]
*  one category is really small. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=949.52s)]
*  The big category is people who just want to get to office because they want to prove [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=950.66s)]
*  something that their apps and their alcoholic fathers or fill some empty space [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=954.46s)]
*  inside or have power over you. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=957.42s)]
*  That's almost everybody. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=958.8199999999999s)]
*  There's a small category people run for office because they really believe [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=960.34s)]
*  something and they've got something to say. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=963.14s)]
*  They really mean it. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=965.34s)]
*  You almost never see these people. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=966.46s)]
*  One of them is JD Vance. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=967.98s)]
*  He didn't need to run for office, but he is. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=969.5s)]
*  He's running for Senate in Ohio. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=971.6999999999999s)]
*  And since the second he announced, places like the Daily Beast and the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=973.02s)]
*  Washington Post and the Atlantic, the axis of protectors, the ruling class have [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=977.56s)]
*  gone crazy. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=982.64s)]
*  They hate him. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=983.36s)]
*  They really hate him. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=984.1999999999999s)]
*  And that's how you know he means it. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=985.76s)]
*  This is how you know JD Vance is serious. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=988.16s)]
*  By inviting that kind of attack and opprobrium, he is proving to these people [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=991.16s)]
*  that he is for real. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=997.36s)]
*  The politicians in the mogul world who are for real are the ones who everybody else [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=998.8s)]
*  hates. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1003.16s)]
*  Vance is promoted to Donald Trump by the very online people around Donald Trump, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1004.66s)]
*  Donald Trump Jr., Steve Bannon, Elon Musk is reportedly was pushing for JD Vance. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1009.42s)]
*  Elon Musk is terminally online. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1015.14s)]
*  And that is what I think walls picked up on. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1017.5s)]
*  And now what Democrats are picking up on, which is that there's something [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1020.58s)]
*  unsettling about where these folks have gone. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1024.3s)]
*  And Trump picked a vice president who amplifies that rather than someone who, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1028.4s)]
*  like Doug Burgum, who calms it down. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1034.36s)]
*  But Trump in 2016 said a lot of things that the media thought was off putting. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1037.92s)]
*  And it turned out he could win a presidential election saying those things. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1043.52s)]
*  A lot of that stuff that seemed to come out of right wing talk radio world. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1047.88s)]
*  Is it possible this is just the next wave, next gen of this kind of rhetoric? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1051.6s)]
*  Donald Trump can absolutely win this election and nobody should have any [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1056.6200000000001s)]
*  illusions about that. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1060.86s)]
*  This is at best a toss up. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1062.5s)]
*  If you look at the polling right now, Harris has gained a lot from where Joe [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1065.6200000000001s)]
*  Biden was. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1068.94s)]
*  She's a head of Trump narrowly in national polling. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1069.98s)]
*  It depends on what polls you're looking at of battleground states. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1073.9s)]
*  And we don't have a lot of high quality battleground state polling since Joe [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1076.18s)]
*  Biden stepped aside, but she's much more competitive there. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1080.3s)]
*  But it is very competitive. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1083.82s)]
*  It's like tied in Pennsylvania, tied in Wisconsin, tied in Michigan. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1085.52s)]
*  The thing that is different is she might've brought Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1089.44s)]
*  back into a winnable place for Democrats. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1094.68s)]
*  So I think she's expanded the map, but she hasn't made Trump an [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1096.5s)]
*  underdog in the Midwest. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1100.3600000000001s)]
*  So the idea that the Trump can't win, that's wrong. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1103.1200000000001s)]
*  But the things that Donald Trump has been good at are not the things that make [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1106.72s)]
*  him off putting in the media. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1112.28s)]
*  I don't believe. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1114.24s)]
*  So Donald Trump correctly identifies certain things that people are very upset [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1115.56s)]
*  about, including immigration. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1119.68s)]
*  And that had been suppressed in both Republican and Democratic [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1121.24s)]
*  party politics in 2016. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1125.32s)]
*  So Donald Trump creates a cleavage in terms of what the election is about in [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1128.3s)]
*  2016 that favored Republicans. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1133.76s)]
*  In 2012, the Obama Romney cleavage was over the economy. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1136.08s)]
*  In 2016, the central cleavage was over immigration. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1140.32s)]
*  I think the smart run for Donald Trump in 2024, which at times it seemed like [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1144.3600000000001s)]
*  he was leaning into, was almost as a kind of stability candidate. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1149.8600000000001s)]
*  Remember how much you liked the Donald Trump economy before all this inflation? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1154.1000000000001s)]
*  Remember how the world seemed more peaceful? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1158.38s)]
*  Maybe that was because Donald Trump was such a loose cannon that people were [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1161.02s)]
*  afraid to do anything that made him angry. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1164.22s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1166.5800000000002s)]
*  That was the argument Trump was making for a while. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1166.74s)]
*  And that argument was breaking through. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1168.9s)]
*  People felt there was a lot of disorder under Joe Biden. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1170.4s)]
*  They also felt that Joe Biden was too old to be in charge of it. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1173.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1176.4799999999998s)]
*  They didn't trust that he could handle a world that had gone a little nuts in the [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1176.6399999999999s)]
*  way, prices seemed to be going nuts in the way that Russia had invaded Ukraine. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1181.1999999999998s)]
*  What was happening in Gaza was a catastrophe. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1186.28s)]
*  And the more Trump falls away from that, the more he's not making the argument [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1189.2399999999998s)]
*  about inflation, but is making the argument that it's not possible to be both [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1195.6s)]
*  black and Indian American at the same time. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1201.0200000000002s)]
*  The more he is out there giving voice to his resentments, the more he is out [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1204.38s)]
*  there saying the election has been and will be stolen. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1210.46s)]
*  Trump was campaigning in Georgia and he opened up in Georgia by attacking Kemp, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1213.7s)]
*  the popular Republican governor of Georgia, for not doing enough to steal [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1221.98s)]
*  the election on his behalf in 2020. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1226.74s)]
*  That is not the Donald Trump that wins elections. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1228.92s)]
*  And what seems to be happening right now is as he feels more backed into a corner [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1232.0s)]
*  and is having more trouble breaking through, he is lashing out from that space [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1236.76s)]
*  of resentment, pay attention to me. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1241.88s)]
*  He's running a more high risk set of plays. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1245.1200000000001s)]
*  And as of yet, I don't think they're working out great for him. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1247.18s)]
*  In some ways, the single best thing that Kamala Harris has done for Democrats is [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1251.24s)]
*  to knock Trump off the campaign he was running and knock him back into the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1255.82s)]
*  resentful, cramped, conspiratorial version of himself that is now emerging. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1263.54s)]
*  Because this guy who is raging at Kemp, this guy who is going to the National [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1270.06s)]
*  Association of Black Journalists and saying that nobody knew Kamala Harris [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1276.3s)]
*  was black, I will say, by the way, as a Californian who was aware of Kamala [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1280.3s)]
*  Harris in California politics, it was known actually people were aware of that. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1285.3s)]
*  This guy does not strike people as excellent on inflation, laser focused on [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1290.96s)]
*  the economic and pocketbook problems they have to solve. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1297.44s)]
*  This is not effective campaigning right now from Donald Trump. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1300.96s)]
*  And Vance is not helping. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1304.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, I'd love to wrap by just talking about Waltz's potential vulnerabilities, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1307.36s)]
*  particularly with race becoming more salient in the campaign. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1311.8600000000001s)]
*  And one that's come up, I think the most is how he responded to the [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1314.9s)]
*  protests and the riots after George Floyd's murder. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1320.38s)]
*  Do you think that's going to be a risk and a point of attack or maybe even [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1323.74s)]
*  reminding, bringing 2020 back into the electorate's memory could potentially [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1329.3000000000002s)]
*  be a plus for Democrats? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1333.5800000000002s)]
*  Do you want to say what the attack is? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1335.66s)]
*  He hesitated in calling the National Guard to respond to the riots in Minneapolis. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1337.76s)]
*  So it's interesting to me because the attack on the left on Waltz was that he [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1344.08s)]
*  did call in the National Guard and there are places that didn't. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1348.76s)]
*  I think it is going to be hard for Trump to make the election about [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1354.04s)]
*  the George Floyd riots. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1359.36s)]
*  It's also not for nothing, a period in which Donald Trump was the president. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1361.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1367.32s)]
*  It reminds people of a period of disorder and chaos under Donald Trump. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1367.56s)]
*  Bringing people back to 2020 when Trump was mishandling the pandemic and there [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1374.8799999999999s)]
*  was a huge racial reckoning is not bringing people back to the part of the [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1379.36s)]
*  Trump presidency that I think Trump should want to remind people of. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1383.64s)]
*  I don't want to tell you that Waltz doesn't have possible vulnerabilities. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1390.12s)]
*  Every politician does. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1395.0s)]
*  I think they're not likely to go after his vulnerabilities or likely to go [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1396.82s)]
*  after Kamala Harris's vulnerabilities. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1399.78s)]
*  So I don't think Waltz has said or done things that are offensive or unusual [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1402.02s)]
*  enough for them to become major dimensions of the campaign. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1409.86s)]
*  And I think the question is, does he help fortify Harris? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1415.4199999999998s)]
*  So that leads you to what are Harris's vulnerabilities? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1418.9799999999998s)]
*  I think the case we're going to make on Harris is one that she is responsible, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1422.0s)]
*  or at least can be blamed for things people do not like about the Biden [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1427.44s)]
*  administration, inflation and high prices and high levels of border crossings. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1430.8s)]
*  Although those have gone substantially down in the last couple of months. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1436.84s)]
*  So that is going to be a series of attacks they run. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1439.92s)]
*  I don't really think Waltz helps her on that in particular, but maybe. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1442.92s)]
*  And then there's either thing that Democrats have often worried about with [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1446.72s)]
*  Harris, which is just to be blunt about it, that a liberal black woman from [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1449.8s)]
*  San Francisco is not a good candidate profile to win Wisconsin, Michigan, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1455.74s)]
*  and Pennsylvania. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1461.54s)]
*  And there, what Waltz is on the ticket to do is balance out the perceptions of Harris. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1463.18s)]
*  They're going to have Waltz functionally going door to door offering to check [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1469.1s)]
*  the oil in your car in those states. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1473.7s)]
*  That is the vibe of Waltz. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1476.3s)]
*  That is what they have picked with him. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1478.02s)]
*  I actually think in a weird way, Shapiro would have been worse for Harris on this [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1480.26s)]
*  level, that Shapiro and Harris are both lawyers. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1483.2s)]
*  They both have a sort of Obama era politics vibe to them. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1486.7s)]
*  Very smart, very educated, seemed like they could have been on the same law [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1490.02s)]
*  review in law school, seemed like they could have worked for the same firm. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1494.8s)]
*  And if you're worried about the way in which the Democratic party has become a [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1499.4199999999998s)]
*  more educated coalition, that it seems to give off a college voter vibe and has [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1503.7s)]
*  begun winning college voters and losing non-college voters, even though Shapiro [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1510.3400000000001s)]
*  does very well in Pennsylvania. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1514.02s)]
*  But remember, Shapiro ran against a truly deranged candidate in Pennsylvania. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1516.14s)]
*  So I don't know how much we should look at that election for governor as a sort [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1520.1000000000001s)]
*  of comp with people who ran against stronger candidates in their races. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1524.26s)]
*  But even though Shapiro does well in Pennsylvania, when you look at them and [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1528.14s)]
*  you listen to them, they sort of have the same energy, which if what you're trying [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1530.72s)]
*  to do is balance out that dimension of Harris and send a signal to voters who [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1535.44s)]
*  don't see in her and in the sort of online fervor around her, something that [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1539.6000000000001s)]
*  looks like them or feels like them, Walls might be helpful from that perspective. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1545.8400000000001s)]
*  Walls is not a former high flying lawyer, but a former high school football coach [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1550.56s)]
*  and longtime army reservist. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1555.88s)]
*  Again, from everything we know from vice presidential past, that probably is not [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1560.12s)]
*  going to matter that much. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1565.54s)]
*  People vote for the top of the ticket, not the bottom of the ticket. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1566.9399999999998s)]
*  But to the extent that there are attacks that I think the Harris campaign is [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1570.1799999999998s)]
*  thinking about, she has these past liberal positions. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1573.78s)]
*  She is associated with the unpopular parts of the Biden administration. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1577.78s)]
*  And she is a candidate who reflects the increasingly highly educated [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1583.12s)]
*  democratic coalition, as opposed to the sort of older, more working [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1589.12s)]
*  class democratic coalition. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1592.76s)]
*  I think Walls is there to help with the last of those. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1594.6s)]
*  And he doesn't make the first two worse. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1597.72s)]
*  Did Harris just pick a younger Biden as her VP? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1600.0s)]
*  Her version of the kid from Scranton? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1604.32s)]
*  It looks like that to me, and it doesn't. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1606.6399999999999s)]
*  And I do think it is easy to forget that what Biden was there to do in 2008 was add [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1608.3799999999999s)]
*  foreign policy experience. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1614.26s)]
*  That was a foreign policy election, first and foremost, at least until the financial [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1616.1799999999998s)]
*  crisis hit and it became an economic election. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1621.04s)]
*  And Biden had a confidence and an ease talking about foreign policy, that if you [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1624.06s)]
*  were worried that Obama's position on Iraq was really helpful among democratic [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1631.2199999999998s)]
*  primary voters, but just as a younger, less tested candidate, that there were some [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1635.24s)]
*  voters who might think this is not the guy I want to use a Hillary Clinton ad [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1641.28s)]
*  answering the 3M phone call. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1646.0s)]
*  Biden was there to help with that. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1648.0s)]
*  He was there for other reasons too, you know, Joe from Scranton, that kind of thing. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1650.08s)]
*  But first and foremost, that was a foreign policy election at that time. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1653.76s)]
*  And Joe Biden was a balancing pick for an anti-war ticket. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1657.56s)]
*  And I think to the extent Walls is there to balance, he is balancing other things for [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1662.78s)]
*  Harris. He's not really a foreign policy figure. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1668.1599999999999s)]
*  He's not a long time member of the Senate. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1670.98s)]
*  He's a Midwestern governor who, again, broke through because there is a straight [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1673.82s)]
*  talking plainness to the way he is able to attack the Trump Vance ticket and the way [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1679.8s)]
*  he is able to present who Democrats are and who occupies the space of normalcy in [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1686.04s)]
*  American life that reshaped the way Democrats were talking in the election. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1694.04s)]
*  Biden, you know, for all that he was known as both a blustery but very effective [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1699.16s)]
*  orator, Biden was never able to do that. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1705.16s)]
*  He did not break through in the O.A. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1707.8s)]
*  campaign. He was there to make Obama seem more seasoned. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1709.24s)]
*  Walls is there to help Harris dominate the messaging of this campaign and help push [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1713.94s)]
*  Trump and Vance into a space that Democrats want them to occupy, which is a space of [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1720.9s)]
*  abnormalcy, a space of something's off with these guys. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1726.3s)]
*  You can't trust them. They're not going to bring stability. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1729.74s)]
*  They're going to bring eccentricity and chaos. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1733.06s)]
*  And Democrats have become very much the party of normalcy. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1737.02s)]
*  The problem Joe Biden begun to represent for them is that in his age and in the way he [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1739.48s)]
*  presented, he didn't comfort people. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1744.28s)]
*  It seemed like a risk to choose Joe Biden. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1746.24s)]
*  Harrison Walls, they want to be the non-risky ticket. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1749.52s)]
*  And Walls is there to make Vance and make Trump look weird, not just by saying it, but [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1752.76s)]
*  by existing as a kind of icon of what normalcy looks like in American life. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1759.56s)]
*  Well, I was just waiting for you to say weird again. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1766.48s)]
*  So I think that's a good moment to wrap. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahTM0JvI3E&t=1768.18s)]
