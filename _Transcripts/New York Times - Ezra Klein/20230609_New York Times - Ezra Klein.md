# What Communes and Other Radical Experiments in Living Together Reveal
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [June 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFyA4u29LWg)
*  So I took a trip to Santa Cruz recently and I was wandering through my favorite bookstore,
*  and I ran across this book by Kristin Godse called Everyday Utopia, What 2000 Years of
*  Wild Experiments Can Teach Us About the Good Life.
*  On one level, this book is about something I love reading about, which is communes and
*  various experiments in communal living, and she's ranging all the way from way back in
*  the eolithic period to modern eco-villages to communes and religious experiments you
*  might have heard about in the 19th and 20th centuries.
*  But on another level, it's this book about the problem of care in society and in families,
*  how to find enough care, how to share the needs of care and the joys of care broadly
*  enough, and how to construct living arrangements that center care and center community.
*  So communes and what happened to them and the various stories around them, old obsession
*  of mine.
*  If you've been listening to the show this year, you know I'm thinking a lot about the
*  of care faced by young families and the elderly and the crisis of loneliness we seem to have
*  in our society.
*  And so this book struck me as I think the term is relevant to my interests.
*  So I asked Godse to come on the show and talk about it.
*  As always, my email is herclineshow.nytimes.com.
*  Kristin Godse, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you so much for having me.
*  So I want to begin with a point you make early in the book where you write, quote,
*  Today's future positive writers critique our economies while largely seeming to ignore
*  that anything might be amiss in our private lives.
*  Tell me about that point.
*  Yeah, so I do think that we're in a kind of plastic moment right now.
*  And in the last decade or so, because of the various challenges that we're facing, you
*  know, in the 21st century, there have been a kind of spate of future positive books that
*  are sort of thinking about economic policies or social policies that can very much be implemented
*  in the public sphere in order to address some of these diverse challenges.
*  It's like what books are you thinking of?
*  So I'm thinking of like Rutger Bregman's Utopia for Realists, right, where he talks about
*  a 15 hour work week or he talks about open borders or universal basic income.
*  Diamantes and Kotler have this book called Abundance, you know, The Future is Better
*  Than You Think.
*  Aaron Bastani wrote a book called Fully Automated Luxury Communism.
*  The best of the titles.
*  Yeah, the best of the titles, which is about like free solar power and asteroid mining
*  and CRISPR gene editing and all sorts of things that will sort of enhance our lives in the
*  future, you know, collective ownership of the algorithms that are eventually going to
*  replace all of our jobs or whatever.
*  But all of these books really tend to ignore the private sphere.
*  And I think this is an issue with a lot of the sort of what I think of as futurism or
*  future positive literature right now is that it leaves the private sphere and family relations
*  intact.
*  And there's sort of an assumption that you can change society, you can change politics
*  and economics without really looking at the fundamental institution in society that underpins
*  those wider and larger structural systems.
*  So if you take those other books you mentioned, I take most of that literature as being about
*  an insufficiency of material goods.
*  And in different ways, I think all those books are about how people of less means right now
*  could have much more in a fairer, more utopic future.
*  And I think your book, which kind of sells itself as about communes, as about an insufficiency
*  of care in our lives.
*  Is that a fair way to read you?
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean, I don't want to say it's about communes because I think that that's a part of it.
*  Certainly I talk about different ways of living collectively in wider networks of love and
*  care with both people who are blood related relatives and our non-blood related friends
*  and colleagues and comrades.
*  So anthropologists will call this consanguineous and non-consanguineous kin.
*  And you know, there are all sorts of-
*  Rolls off the tongue.
*  Rolls off the tongue, right?
*  There are all sorts of interesting studies about, you know, how human societies over
*  time have organized these sort of groups, bands of humans.
*  The thing about the family or the expanded family or the chosen family, whatever term
*  you want to use, is that it widens these networks of care and affection so that not only are
*  people supporting each other and for instance, supporting each other's children as well,
*  right?
*  So I talk a lot about this collective child rearing.
*  It's also about sharing resources in a way that actually benefits the community, that
*  actually gives people in that community access to more resources while simultaneously being
*  less wasteful.
*  And to maybe alienate us from our present a little bit, you're talking about a lot of
*  experiments here, but something that has been more on my mind since going through COVID
*  with two young children is that we're living in a pretty unusual experiment now.
*  That if you look at the vast arc of human history, the way a lot of people and you know,
*  I'll use the American case for now, are living in small nuclear families where you have two
*  working parents, one to four, one to three kids oftentimes, and in many cases you're
*  far from any extended family.
*  That has become a very normal way to live, right?
*  If I tell you that's how I live, you're not going to raise an eyebrow.
*  But that's actually a shocking aberration across really almost any time period you might
*  want to look at.
*  Exactly.
*  I think that idea of a heterosexual monogamous couple raising their own biological offspring
*  through bi-parental care in a single family home surrounded by their own private stuff
*  is really a unique family form.
*  And as you said, it's an aberration.
*  We can look across the world and we can look trans historically, cross culturally and trans
*  historically and what we can see is that human family forms show a remarkable amount of diversity.
*  Depending on climactic, geographic, economic, political, social circumstances.
*  One of the things that makes humans so incredibly adaptive is precisely our ability to sort
*  of shift our mating practices and our child rearing practices in order to better suit
*  the environments that we find ourselves in.
*  So what I think that the book is trying to do most importantly is to destabilize this
*  notion that living in the nuclear family in your own single family private home with your
*  stuff and you're providing bi-parental care for your own biological offspring or your
*  adoptive offspring is sometimes the case.
*  That is just one way of organizing family life.
*  And that way is completely contingent on a variety of historical circumstances that could
*  change.
*  So I want to read a quote from you here.
*  You say,
*  And I think a good starting question here is why not?
*  Many of us could.
*  These things are available in some cases.
*  There is intentional living communities.
*  People could live near to their families, right?
*  Living their extended family is a time-honored way of doing this.
*  A lot of people aren't.
*  So what is behind the choice to not if these are such good ideas?
*  So in a very sort of simplistic way, when you think about our architecture, right, the
*  ways in which we literally box ourselves into single family homes, we do not have the architectural
*  options available to us in order to live in these wider networks of care and support.
*  And as I mentioned in the book, some cities actually don't allow for non-blood related
*  people to share single family homes.
*  There are ordinances and zoning regulations and sort of NIMBYism around our houses.
*  Similarly, collective child rearing, the upper classes, these classes that have the most
*  to bequeath to their children through this intergenerational transfer of wealth and privilege,
*  they often want to isolate their children from the children of others.
*  And so when we look historically at the way children have been raised, they've been raised
*  away from other children.
*  And so there are these sort of historical practices that are by no means, quote unquote,
*  natural.
*  They're social constructs.
*  They are the products of certain types of religious and political institutions that
*  shape the way we think today is the, quote unquote, normal way to raise a family.
*  But that is in and of itself part of the problem.
*  So tell me about the kibbutzim.
*  You spent some time on them in the book.
*  I know a bit about them and have always been interested, but many people may not be familiar.
*  So what were they?
*  How did they work?
*  And what are they?
*  So first kibbutz was established near the Sea of Galilee in, I think, 1909.
*  It was called Degania.
*  And these were basically groups of Ashkenazi Jews who were coming from Europe to settle
*  in what was then Ottoman Palestine.
*  And they really believed in this idea of self-labor.
*  So they were often associated with the Bund.
*  Many of them had sort of socialist background, socialist ideals that they were kind of drawing
*  from.
*  So these were agricultural communities that basically did all of their labor together,
*  owned all of their property in common, and raised their children in common.
*  They were radically egalitarian communities.
*  And they're very important because they still exist to this day.
*  Not all of them, many of them since the 80s have been privatized.
*  But I think about 20% of them are still fully communal.
*  And the one that I happened to have spent some time on back in 1990 is one of the ones
*  that is still communal and was fully communal then, which is this incredible idea that people
*  basically rotate through a variety of different jobs.
*  Everyone eats together.
*  Everyone has access to the same resources.
*  And it's a sort of extended, non-consequential kin network that you're living in.
*  It's very much like living on a college campus in the ways in which everything that you need
*  is walking distance or bicycling distance from you.
*  Did you live on one in the 90s?
*  Yes.
*  What was that experience?
*  Which one was it?
*  How did you end up there?
*  What was it like?
*  Yeah, so it was Kibbutz Hatsarim.
*  I was a college student at UC Santa Cruz, as I think you know.
*  I'm a banana slug like you.
*  And a very dear friend of mine was Israeli and decided to go back to Israel.
*  So I ended up going to live with her for a couple of months on her kibbutz in Hatsarim,
*  near Be'er Sheva, in the Negev Desert.
*  And this was a kibbutz that had an avocado orchard.
*  It had an irrigation factory where it made this irrigation tubing.
*  And then there were a variety of other jobs associated with like the dining hall, washing
*  dishes, looking after children, you know, doing sort of cleaning and various chores that
*  needed to be done in order to keep up the kibbutz.
*  So we lived in basically sort of dormitories.
*  There was a job board.
*  And in the morning you were assigned to a particular place.
*  You had some choice.
*  You could express your preferences, but there was basically a kind of a labor requirement.
*  And in exchange for your labor, working in the avocado orchard, you know, picking avocados,
*  or working in the night shift in the irrigation tubing factory, or doing the dishes, which
*  was another, you know, or working in the dining hall, all of these things in exchange for
*  your labor, a certain number of hours a day, you were basically given full room and board
*  for the entire time that you stayed on the kibbutz.
*  And tell me about the attitude in the kibbutz team towards children, towards families, towards
*  the education of children, because that's been a big part of that project.
*  Exactly.
*  And so the thing that's quite unique about the kibbutz team is that they raise their
*  children collectively and from a very early age, because many of these early kibbutz team
*  were very poor.
*  And both men and women had to contribute an incredible amount of agricultural labor in
*  order for them to function.
*  All of the children were kept together collectively in something called the Children's House,
*  where there were a few women, and it was usually women, who looked after the children.
*  Now that didn't mean that mothers didn't have access to their children, but especially in
*  the very early experiments, the children were raised collectively and they also slept collectively.
*  And so since there is almost 100 years of data from child psychologists who have looked
*  at the children of the kibbutz team, we actually know a lot about collective child rearing
*  because of the kibbutz experiments.
*  And it turns out that collective sleeping was a disaster.
*  For the most part, children did not get the care and attention that they needed from the
*  few women who worked those night shifts.
*  But the childcare that was offered in the Children's House during the day, with dedicated
*  caregivers that really followed the children as they aged before they went to school, those
*  relationships were extremely secure and loving, and basically the parents and the caregivers
*  sort of worked together.
*  So it really is this idea of cooperative breeding, which is instantiated in this sort
*  of more collective community.
*  Now over time, some of these have changed, right?
*  Once the kibbutz got richer, they were able to build onto their houses and then they had
*  rooms for the children to come home so they could sleep at night.
*  But it's a fascinating experiment.
*  And what we know from those experiments is that children thrive in a community of loving,
*  caring adults beyond just the nuclear family.
*  The kibbutz team were a lighter version of this.
*  You go through in the book some heavier versions, where one tension in a lot of these experiments
*  is how much the specificity of love, of resources, takes away from the communality of them.
*  And as such, I mean, it's easy enough to think about that in terms of money and sharing it
*  or not sharing it.
*  But one thing that a lot of these projects, these utopian projects, try to do is explicitly
*  break the parent-child bond.
*  Really try to separate parents from their children, make it so all the children would
*  have all the parents and all the parents would have all the children.
*  But in doing that, try to sever that fundamental tie.
*  As a parent reading this, I mean, I felt myself recoiling, right?
*  If this is a cost of community, I don't want to pay that cost.
*  But I'm curious how you thought about it, how you thought about reading it and kind
*  of tracking the way that evolved and did in over time.
*  So I'm a parent too.
*  I have my own daughter who's now grown, but I also recoiled in some of these experiments,
*  particularly like the Oneida community, where it was very clear that the children actually
*  did quite well.
*  It was the mothers who suffered because they wanted the attachments to their children.
*  The children were actually much more flexible, it turns out, than the parents are.
*  At least in that experiment in the Oneida community, it was the mothers who suffered
*  the most.
*  Even in the kibbutz, right?
*  It went from babies going to the children's house very soon after birth to like three
*  months after birth so that mothers would have more time with their children.
*  And mothers did increasingly assert their roles over the children.
*  But I think that if you have more than one child, for those people who are a sibling,
*  you know, if you're in a family with more than one child or you have more than one child,
*  you will know that parents are supposed to love their children equally.
*  You can never ask a parent, which one is your favorite, right?
*  That's sort of like a no-no of a question.
*  And the idea of expanding these parental connections with more children is to sort of fundamentally
*  challenge the idea that only your biological child is worth your attention and love, right?
*  That only your immediate biological offspring is worthy of your wealth and privilege, which
*  is going to be transferred intergenerationally.
*  And that can be money, that can be titles, but that can also just be affection, right?
*  So one of the things that I think is...
*  But isn't there something a little bit weird about describing affection and love as wealth
*  and privilege?
*  I mean, there's a way in which it's true, right?
*  And like the attention my kids get from me, there is value in that.
*  And it does have an intergenerational transmission effect.
*  But the family is an important institution.
*  Absolutely, right.
*  And I think that we think about our immediate biological kids, and then you might have like
*  your nieces and nephews.
*  Right, you're more likely to help your nieces and nephews.
*  Right, you're more likely to help your nieces and nephews than your second cousins, right?
*  Or maybe the kids of your best friend, right?
*  All sorts of societies have practices of god parenting, compadres, comadres, right?
*  This idea of other adults that are sort of stand-ins for parents or sort of supplemental
*  parents should anything happen to the primary parent.
*  We also know there's a long history of cooperative breeding where older siblings helped raise
*  their younger siblings, grandmothers, extremely important.
*  So we have always had wider networks, some of them kin related, but interestingly, some
*  of them not kin related, right?
*  So we have fictive kin, like, you know, Uncle Joe, who's not actually your uncle, but he's
*  like your dad's best friend from college, right?
*  So it's not that radical.
*  Okay, so if I have my own biological children, obviously I want to love them.
*  But when I take my daughter to childcare, I also want her caregivers to love her too,
*  to care for her too.
*  And I don't want to feel jealous of their love for her.
*  I think she will be better off if she's loved and cared for by another adult.
*  In this circumstance, if I'm taking her to daycare, I'm paying for that love.
*  Like you said, rich people can outsource this.
*  But we have a long history of bringing these alloparents is the term that we use into our
*  children's lives.
*  And again, the psychological literature shows us that children can have secure attachments
*  to us as parents, as well as secure attachments to their grandmothers and their biological
*  uncles and their fictive uncles.
*  Right, but that's a different, I think you slightly flipped the situation I was inquiring
*  about, which is I want my children loved by as many people as possible.
*  But there have been a lot of experiments here saying that my children should be loved
*  less by me so that I can love other children more.
*  And one thing that I think is a tension and that is always in people's minds around a
*  lot of experimental ways of living is the sort of Burkean objection that the way human
*  affection and families have evolved, particularly like the something as core as parental and
*  child love is not a thing people should be messing with because they woke up and they're
*  like, I have an idea.
*  Right.
*  But see, to come back to what we were just talking about, for your child to be loved
*  by others, it requires them to love your child as much as their own child.
*  Right.
*  So it's all interrelated.
*  Well, not as much.
*  But you have to kind of like destabilize those bonds, right, in some ways.
*  So you know, for instance, just like on a purely biological level, right.
*  So a lactating person, that milk lets down the cry of any baby, not just the biological
*  child.
*  We've had a long history of things like wet nurses.
*  Now, again, I'm not saying that we should not have parents and children.
*  I'm saying that we should take the family units that we have and submerge them in wider
*  networks of love and care and comradeship and support.
*  And that can be done in all sorts of ways that can be done through expanding the social
*  safety net, which is what many countries in Europe and around the world have done.
*  It can also be by creating more localized communities where we're sharing our affective
*  resources more broadly.
*  But in order to do that, I think that we have to understand that our biological investments
*  in our children as they are right now are the product of an incredibly competitive society
*  where we have very high levels of inequality and where this intergenerational both transfer
*  of wealth and privilege and love and affection, which is sort of interestingly tied to each
*  other, the bi parental resources invested in children in the particular way that we're
*  doing it is the product of highly unequal societies.
*  If our societies were less unequal, if we lived in a more egalitarian world, the desire
*  to see our biological offspring thrive, it's not going to go away, obviously, but it's
*  not going to be as fraught the fear that our own children won't thrive in the future.
*  So if we look at like Thomas More's Utopia, he talks exactly about how when the Utopians
*  shared their resources, all people in this society, even though they are in bi parental
*  families, right, they're secure in the knowledge that their children and grandchildren for
*  as many generations as they can imagine will be safe and will be cared for.
*  And that's a kind of happiness.
*  That's a kind of security that very few of us have in the way that we organize our families
*  and our societies today.
*  So I've always been fascinated by the Kibbutz team.
*  I think it's dated differently in different places, but around roughly the 1980s, they
*  began to go into decline.
*  The Kibbutz team were a big deal in Israel.
*  They are less of a common thing now.
*  There was some thought that maybe this would become just like the way people lived, right?
*  Maybe we have found a better way.
*  And then it turned out people began making other choices to that.
*  And I'm always interested in this.
*  So what is your theory or what did you see in your reading and research of why they went
*  into decline?
*  Were they big enough that you could have imagined them going the other way if people really
*  liked it?
*  I do think that there were exogenous shocks that had to do with the global economy that
*  put an extreme amount of pressure economically on the way that they were organizing their
*  businesses and created international competition for their products in a way that gave them
*  less of a competitive advantage.
*  Again, you're trying to create a community within a hegemonic sort of global capitalist
*  society.
*  You're going to have pressures.
*  But I also think that there was this sense that younger generations had issues.
*  They didn't want to go out and become doctors and lawyers or professionals and then contribute
*  all of their salaries back into the kibbutz, which is what's required of these communal
*  communities so that the whole community thrived.
*  So a lot of younger kibbutzniks left.
*  But then, interestingly, particularly after 2008, what you see is they're starting to
*  go back and you're starting to see the emergence of urban kibbutzim, where a group of young
*  people are starting to share their resources in non-rural agricultural contexts.
*  Because again, the other thing about the kibbutzim is that they are largely agricultural.
*  So as with many utopian experiments, the same sort of fundamental ideas fall off and then
*  they reemerge under a different guise.
*  And then they fall off and they reemerge under a different guise.
*  And I think that's what we're seeing right now is this reemergence of this interest in
*  these more sustainable ways of living.
*  I was talking to a friend who lives in a kind of smaller intentional community.
*  And it hasn't been going on for that long, so who knows if it'll work out in the long
*  run.
*  But I was asking him why it seemed to be working pretty well now.
*  And one thing he said was that compared to a lot of communal experiments in the past,
*  they weren't trying to create an economy, too.
*  They were just trying to live together.
*  They were not attempting to also be a farm and also make maple syrup and also, you know,
*  as many of these experiments in the past have been.
*  So one question in terms of what different communities are learning here is in a economy
*  that specializes where, you know, there's a million different things people do, was
*  that just part of what held back the American commune movement of the 70s, the kibbutzim
*  in Israel that many people might like co-living, but they don't necessarily want that to be
*  the only economy they can participate in.
*  Right, exactly.
*  So many of these intentional communities are very much based on this idea of self-labor,
*  where everybody in the community is creating a kind of communal, industrial, or agricultural
*  wealth that they are then sharing.
*  And yeah, I absolutely think that that's really hard.
*  So one of the most interesting communal experiments was a follower of Fourier in Guise in France
*  between 1859 and 1968.
*  It was called the Familistari or the Social Palace.
*  So it's 109 years.
*  A group of workers all live together in this huge, you know, sort of basically like a hotel.
*  They shared their resources and they had this foundry where they were making enameled iron
*  stoves.
*  And what eventually sort of put the nail in the coffin of that experiment, and you know,
*  by the end of it, it was a fully cooperative enterprise.
*  The guy who started it died and he transferred all of the ownership to the workers.
*  But the international pressures, the competition of trying to sell these enameled iron work
*  stoves, and you know, it just didn't work out.
*  So I think you're right.
*  I think we could live more collectively.
*  There have been these recent articles about quote unquote mom-unes, right?
*  People mothers getting together and raising their kids, they buy a house and they raise
*  their kids together.
*  Or young adults have always done things like flat shares, right?
*  And that's a very common thing to do when you're single.
*  But why not just expand that to when you have like, you know, you and your best friend,
*  maybe like you guys get married at the same time, you have kids around the same time,
*  why not just buy a big house together?
*  Well, partially because there aren't houses to buy.
*  You have to have the resources to build something more communal.
*  That could be a very sustainable way of living.
*  It could be a very comfortable way of taking care of a wider community dealing with aging
*  parents.
*  So this is the co-housing movement in Denmark that has tried to balance community with privacy.
*  So there are so many models.
*  And I agree with you that if you could take out the living part from the production part,
*  that might be one way of dealing with the fact that sometimes the productive part of
*  these experiments is what ultimately leads to their failure.
*  One thing that brings up is that there are two phases of life right now where it's extremely
*  common to live in community.
*  So one is if you go to college, and if you're young, you don't have that much money.
*  So from 18 to, I don't know, 26, probably, I lived in community, I lived in a dorm, and
*  then I lived with a bunch of housemates because I was making no money as an entry level journalism
*  job in Washington, DC.
*  And then when you're elderly increasingly, you have to be because people often don't
*  have family nearby or don't have much family nearby or their family can't take care of
*  them that much.
*  There are these huge retirement communities.
*  I mean, you can think of things.
*  I think it is a different name now, but what used to be called Leisure Village in Florida,
*  elsewhere, then you have senior citizen homes.
*  It's funny because all these sound radical when we talk about these experiments in communal
*  living, but we've completely normalized it so much so that we almost forget it happens
*  for two pretty important life phases.
*  Well, and for two quite long life phases, right?
*  If you think about the time that you're alive, that you're actually raising children, right?
*  Actively doing bi-parental care, which is really kind of the moment in life when you
*  need the most help from other people.
*  If you have young kids out there, you know that having helpful neighbors, family members,
*  kin, colleagues, friends, anybody to babysit in a pinch or to help you out when you just
*  away, you know, those moments of our lives when we're parenting can be so taxing and,
*  more importantly, right, the bi-parental unit can be so freighted by the work of that, right?
*  So that so many relationships can't really withstand the pressures of parenting, particularly
*  of young children, right?
*  So that if there were these wider networks, if we had neighbors and family members, right?
*  So I talk about in the book this community, Twin Oaks in rural Virginia or an eco-village
*  in southern Portugal.
*  You can say what an eco-village is.
*  Yeah, so an eco-village is an intentional community where the sort of primary purpose
*  of the intentional community is to live more sustainably in nature.
*  Many of them practice permaculture, which are forms of sustainable native agriculture.
*  Some of them are really quite extreme as in like prepping for the fall of the nation state
*  in the end of capitalism.
*  They're really trying to live off the land in a way that they could do it if like all
*  resources were no longer available.
*  So there are, you know, some of them are just sort of living off the grid.
*  Some of them are not off the grid, but are just sort of sharing resources in order to
*  reduce their carbon footprints.
*  So there's a real spectrum of these eco-village communities.
*  But I would say that in earlier times in human history, many of what we would think of as
*  communal living, communities that were living together were religious.
*  They were often people who were living together in order to get closer to God.
*  Now interestingly, some of these were celibate communities.
*  Some of them were not.
*  Some of them like the Oneida community, the spiritual perfectionists, they practiced group
*  marriage.
*  But many of these, if you think about the Shakers or any sort of cloistered cenobitic
*  monastic community, they still raised children because they often took in orphans and they
*  often took in children that were otherwise unwanted because they were born out of wedlock
*  or whatever.
*  So they were still raising children, but they were raising children communally and they
*  were not mating, so to speak.
*  But there was an allowance made for communal living for people who wanted to live out a
*  particular set of spiritual practices.
*  And this goes back to the early followers of the Buddha.
*  In the Pythagorean case, they were living communally in order to explore the mysteries
*  of the universe and study mathematics.
*  But in those cases, the goal was a somewhat more spiritual one.
*  Today, I would say that the major impetus for more communal forms of living, and again,
*  these run the gamut, are to reduce loneliness, to spread out parenting more equitably and
*  the sort of daily work of life more evenly among a wider group of people, but really
*  primarily to reduce our carbon footprint.
*  Because it's very clear that living in these communities reduces our impact on the earth.
*  I wonder often how much of the loneliness crisis is simply the decline of not religion
*  as a belief system, but religion as a social technology.
*  So I remember having a conversation with Judith Shulovitz about her great book about Sabbath,
*  and particularly Jewish Sabbath, but not only.
*  And something she talks about there is in Orthodox communities, or actually any Jewish
*  community that abides by the prohibition against driving on the Sabbath, you have
*  to live within walking distance of your shul.
*  And that isn't necessarily living in the community of one household, but it means there are a
*  lot of people you're connected to very nearby you.
*  And my understanding of the broader data on loneliness is that being more religious is
*  associated with being less lonely just because you're going to be very attached to some kind
*  of social, spiritual institution, be that a church, be that a synagogue, be that a mosque,
*  whatever it is.
*  When you look at this and you look at how often these experiments were religiously motivated,
*  and you think about just how much religion did hold people in things that were more like
*  communal living, how do you think about the interaction between secularization and loneliness
*  and some of these questions you're exploring?
*  Yeah, so I definitely think that the religious glue, the shared set of beliefs, is very important
*  for a lot of these communities.
*  But I don't necessarily think that it's secularization per se, because people can still congregate
*  around shared belief systems.
*  I talk a lot in the book about the ways in which inequality and the precarity of our
*  economies and the difficulties of just meeting our basic needs in societies with very frayed
*  social safety nets really pits us against each other.
*  This is like Putnam's bowling alone argument, right?
*  The fraying of civil society in so many ways.
*  We used to have all these Elks clubs and lodges and things like that.
*  We were much more communally oriented even outside of the church or outside of religious
*  institutions.
*  However, the secularization and the competition of our societies and the ways in which we've
*  organized our families and we've moved out to the suburbs and we box ourselves into these
*  single-family homes where we're divided from people by big yards, right?
*  People want space and people want privacy and people want this isolation.
*  Then they drive into the city in their privately owned automobiles by themselves.
*  There's almost no interaction going on.
*  Now if you think about the pandemic, we used to have work friends.
*  We used to know people at work, right?
*  Now we're just working from home and we see our colleagues on a Zoom screen maybe.
*  There's so much about the way that we're living our modern lives that isolates, isolates,
*  isolates, isolates.
*  That's why I say that I think the EcoVillage movement is so interesting because for some
*  environmentalism has sort of become almost like a spiritual practice, right?
*  The idea that we have to preserve the earth has sort of risen to the idea of a kind of
*  non-material goal that people are aspiring to.
*  And so I do think that it's really important to recognize that secularization is part of
*  this problem, but it's not the only part of the problem.
*  It has to do with the context within which that secularization is occurring.
*  How do you think about the idea of wants?
*  You just mentioned people get richer and they want to move to a bigger house in the suburbs.
*  Certainly I observe that when people get richer and they have a lot of economic choice, what
*  they do is not buy a place for them and all their friends.
*  It happens occasionally, but they get a big house and it's usually a little bit further
*  out and how do you think about the arguably revealed preference of wealth leading to separation
*  that might suggest this isn't actually what people want?
*  It's sometimes what they're forced to accept, but it isn't really what they want.
*  I didn't stay in the dorms at Santa Cruz forever.
*  I left and then found a partner and we got a little tiny place of our own and those were
*  choices.
*  And yeah, when I've had young kids, I've been like, ooh, maybe I made all these decisions
*  wrong.
*  But one day I won't have young kids.
*  Exactly.
*  And then you might move into a facility with a bunch of older people and have a big party
*  like you did at Santa Cruz, right?
*  So it's funny that, like I said, this moment of our lives when we actually need the village
*  to raise our children is the moment when we isolate ourselves the most severely from our
*  communities.
*  So the question of wants, you know, I think there's a lot to be said and, you know, there's
*  a broad literature on this and this idea of what we are really after is esteem.
*  People want to be esteemed and yes, wealth buys us esteem and there are certain markers
*  in our societies that, you know, we collectively agree give us esteem, like having a really
*  big house with a big wall around it, right?
*  So nobody can come knocking on your door and try to sell you something.
*  You can isolate yourself in your private car, maybe even with a driver so you don't even
*  have to drive, right?
*  So there are all these ways in which we can isolate ourselves.
*  But what we're really after at the end of the day is esteem.
*  And I think that many of these utopian writers have precisely said esteem is something that
*  we all want.
*  That's something quote unquote natural.
*  But esteem doesn't necessarily have to be tied to wealth and privilege.
*  It can be tied to all sorts of other things in our society, such as being a part of a
*  wider network of love and care and seeing our children thrive and seeing our communities
*  thrive and living in more equitable societies where people aren't suffering as much as they
*  are.
*  I believe it's William Godwin who talks about esteem as like being a good person.
*  Wow, what a wild thought like that you could be esteemed for being like a good human being
*  and not necessarily just being somebody with the biggest house or the biggest car or the
*  biggest whatever.
*  So our concept of esteem is flexible.
*  It's there.
*  But I think that we can shift our wants.
*  And lots of societies have struggled with that, both secular and religious.
*  And I think that that's a conversation we still need to have.
*  And we can learn a lot about looking at these utopian communities and how they have a portion
*  to esteem within their particular communities.
*  In a way, what strikes me about some of this is that we're putting the choice as between
*  the kind of modern, let's call it like affluent urban isolation and some kind of communal
*  living.
*  But historically, maybe given that a lot of the experiments you look at are from earlier
*  in the 20th or 19th centuries, they're actually putting a choice in a time when you had much
*  more extended families.
*  And so in some ways, at least one of the questions being raised here, you could imagine society
*  saying we've made a mistake.
*  And the mistake we've made is we've gone away from the extended family.
*  And we should hitch esteem to something more like relationships with your parents and the
*  fact that your cousins are near you and so on versus experiments in different kinds of
*  living.
*  How do you think about that as the choice between relying more on our bigger family
*  networks and looking kind of at the scant of people who maybe move away from...
*  We moved to New York for my partner's family.
*  But I've made moves that are just away from all family.
*  I moved after college to Washington, D.C. because I wanted to follow my dream of being
*  a political reporter and that moved me away from my family.
*  And in another society, maybe people would have said, like, what a selfish jerk you are.
*  Here's where our economic priorities come into play.
*  So I think you recently had Joseph Henrik on the show.
*  And he was talking about in his work, he talks a lot about how communities with more expanded
*  families have lower levels of economic development and communities with fewer instances, for
*  instance, of cousin marriage, I believe, is the specific thing that he's looking at.
*  So the more nuclear our families, the higher levels of our economic development.
*  He does this by looking at these global light maps, right, to show that...
*  And a lot of other evidence.
*  And a lot of other evidence.
*  But there's, you know, there are these things.
*  So there's this choice that we're making about growth in a capitalist society or in
*  a quote unquote highly developed society.
*  We're making a choice to isolate ourselves and our families for the ability to realize
*  our professional dreams and hopefully increase our economic status and increase the economic
*  status of our societies.
*  I think when certain kinds of conservatives talk about the breakdown of the family and
*  the nervousness they have around this, they're really worried about not only the breakdown
*  of the family, but the effects that that will have on the economy.
*  Right?
*  So if we were to submerge ourselves into more expanded networks of families, more kin, both
*  blood related and non-blood related kin, these wider networks of support and care that I
*  keep talking about, I think there's a fear that our economic productivity will be less,
*  that we'll be less able to realize our dreams, that we'll be less able to innovate, to be
*  productive, to extract resources, to create wealth, all of these things that are associated
*  with smaller, more tightly blood related families.
*  But again, this is a choice that we are making as a society.
*  And this is a choice that is not necessarily people are making it consciously.
*  It's just sort of in the water of our societies that those are the things that we're supposed
*  to want.
*  I moved away from my family too.
*  Academics are incredibly itinerant for this reason, because we're constantly being sort
*  of chasing after whatever tenure track position is available or adjunct position or whatever.
*  Academics are an incredibly precarious bunch of people.
*  And we are trading off exactly what you said, like I'm a jerk.
*  I left my family.
*  I left the networks that I could have contributed to of my friends, my cousins, my colleagues,
*  in order to pursue my own selfish individualist goals in life.
*  So I think that we need to be really open eyed about these tradeoffs.
*  And we often are not.
*  We're not having those conversations.
*  We just assume that this family form that has come down to us is quote unquote natural.
*  It's just not.
*  I think that's very well said.
*  But I'm also asking a question from the perspective of let's say society tomorrow woke up and
*  was like, oh no, look at these loneliness numbers.
*  Look how hard it is to raise kids.
*  As you noted, I think glancingly there, there's a lot of increasing concern that our fertility
*  rate is low.
*  Way low.
*  And if you're a parent, I don't think this is a mystery at all.
*  It is extremely hard to have children.
*  It is basically non manageable.
*  And the idea that I would have four of them, I don't know how much time and energy you
*  think I have.
*  You're not going to turn that around in a society built like ours.
*  And the point there is not like slightly more family friendly policy.
*  You'd actually have to rebuild this totally.
*  So let's say though that you woke up, you're like, oh no, we want to.
*  And then one way to take that is the more the direction of your book, right?
*  We need to experiment with very different forms of living.
*  And another way to take it is we don't need a new experiment.
*  We have a phenomenal structure that is already built into humanity, which is the family.
*  And we should go not sort of forwards into new structures, but backwards into the one
*  we already had.
*  Put my question more directly.
*  Why did you not write a book worried about the particular crisis you're worried about,
*  about why we should all live near our extended family in dual income, modern structures,
*  right?
*  So it's not just about the expanded family.
*  I agree that that's a great step in the right direction.
*  And I think that most people who read the book are going to say, yeah, I should spend
*  more time with my cousins and my aunts and my uncles and find some godparents, right?
*  But not all of us have those wide kinship relations.
*  Some of us are alienated from our consanguineous kin.
*  Some of us have moved away, as you have, from your family, your expanded family networks.
*  So that doesn't mean we have to just throw up our arms and give up, right?
*  It means that we can create families, this sort of concept of fictive kin, right?
*  These affines.
*  We can find ways to build community.
*  And that creates the same type of familial relationships.
*  And we can formalize those things, right?
*  So there are new ways of, quote unquote, platonic parenting, right?
*  So people who are not necessarily in a romantic pair, but who decide they want to have children.
*  And guess what?
*  It turns out that platonic parents are going to make choices about who they're platonic
*  parenting with a lot more rationally than those of us who fall in love with our partners
*  and have kids, right?
*  And then when the love fades, you know, there can be problems.
*  Or again, when the stresses of child rearing freight those relationships.
*  And basically marriage is also a practice of forging kinship bonds, right?
*  So the reason I want to think about 2050 rather than 1950 is because I think 1950 in the United
*  States at least, and I think in many parts of the developed world, is much more about
*  consanguineous kin.
*  And I really want to talk about the possibilities of non-consanguineous kin, which often have
*  been a feature of these utopian communities over time and across cultures.
*  Let's talk about platonic parenting.
*  Because I actually know now a bunch of people doing that.
*  I know three people raising one kid.
*  I know six people raising three kids.
*  And they're very beautiful households.
*  It's not that common, but it certainly seems to me that it's becoming more common.
*  I believe there have been some legal decisions that actually recognize those as rights.
*  And then of course you have something much more common today than it was 100 years ago,
*  which is you have families where the parents divorced and now they're step parents.
*  My parents are divorced.
*  I have a stepmother who is wonderful.
*  I'd be curious to hear even aside from the question of experimental living about some
*  of these experiments in parenting.
*  Absolutely.
*  So that's another kind of concrete way in the book that I talk about how our laws are
*  a little bit out of date, right?
*  So only some states allow for things like tri-parenting or multi-parenting, where if
*  you have a step parent or a bonus parent, they like to call them sometimes, if that
*  bonus parent wants to become a guardian of a child, the biological parent often has to
*  give up their rights.
*  There can't be three legal guardians to a child.
*  Now that's changing in some states.
*  Maine is one of them.
*  You also have this thing called mitochondrial replacement therapy, where you can literally
*  have two biological mothers and one biological father for one child.
*  So literally three biological parents.
*  Our laws around parenting, multi-parenting and guardianship are completely out of date,
*  right?
*  So I think particularly in communities where you have same-sex couples and you may have
*  a sperm donor or an egg donor or a surrogate mother, there are going to be constellations
*  of family forms that are not going to fit the traditional way that we imagine the heterosexual
*  nuclear family.
*  So we are starting to see all of this creativity around how people are parenting.
*  Some of it's platonic parenting.
*  Some of it's single mothers, right?
*  Like the mom-unes, right?
*  So single women who are divorced or widowed or maybe who never had a partner who are banding
*  together.
*  They're not necessarily in romantic relationships, but they're deciding to share their resources
*  and their attentions to raise their children together.
*  Parenting is stressful.
*  It can take an incredible amount of time and energy and resources, but it can also be incredibly
*  joyful.
*  It can also be incredibly rewarding.
*  I'm a mother.
*  I love my daughter.
*  And as hard as it was, I would not give up those experiences for the world.
*  But why not share them?
*  Why not spread it around?
*  It would be so much easier for all of us.
*  And I'm not saying that we should run out and have like 15 other co-parents, right?
*  It could just be one or two or three.
*  And it could just be a grandmother or an aunt, right?
*  So there are all sorts of ways in which we can think creatively about the family.
*  And yes, some of these utopian experiments, as you've been pointing out, are extreme.
*  The point is that sometimes we have to look at the extremes and then walk ourselves back
*  from them and say, okay, so maybe my kids should spend more time with their godparents.
*  Maybe my kids should spend more time with my sister and her kids.
*  Maybe my colleague who has kids around the same age as mine, you know, we should do more
*  sleepovers, right?
*  So there are all sorts of ways in which you could imagine just bringing other alloparents
*  into a relationship.
*  I think in some ways people think of the romantic partnership as a glue.
*  Yes.
*  That keeps the parents connected to the very hard work of parenting.
*  So you said a second ago that people who engage in platonic parenting, and it's worth noting
*  that this is going to be a selection effect, not that many people do that.
*  Exactly.
*  Maybe they pick their partners more rationally.
*  And the thing I thought when I read that in your book, that possibility in your book was,
*  well, parenting isn't rational.
*  Sometimes you just keep going.
*  And I think that's something that when people imagine, you know, we're going to have a kid
*  together and maybe our friend Pete is going to be the third parent because Pete's great
*  and wants to have kids and doesn't.
*  Is it that, well, what if Pete just ups and leaves one day?
*  What if Pete is just like, this is tough and I actually like being able to take vacations
*  and go out at night and whatever.
*  And that there's something about the intensity of those bonds that you need to keep people
*  stuck to the project of parenting, which unlike a lot of other things in life, you know, if
*  I leave my job, my job's going to be fine.
*  If I leave a seven-year-old who adores me, that's going to be a trauma.
*  Yes.
*  How do couples solve that?
*  One of the big questions that a lot of these communities have grappled with, right, both
*  on a very local scale as well as on a huge national scale when we think about experiments
*  in the 20th century.
*  So a couple years ago, David Brooks wrote this wonderful article, The Nuclear Family
*  Was a Mistake in the Atlantic, where he really talks about how the precarity of the romantic
*  bond is actually really destabilizing for children because of high rates of divorce, because
*  of abandonment, increasing numbers of single mothers, right?
*  So what do we know right now?
*  We know, A, that a lot of young people are just deciding not to have kids because it's
*  hard, so birth rates are declining.
*  For the people who do have kids, they're straining under the demands of parenthood, and that's
*  straining their relationships, right?
*  And I talk about in the book the reality of some of these things like postpartum depression
*  or various forms of abuse in the family.
*  You know, the family can be a black box that hides a lot of pain.
*  There is this very important role that the stable couple plays in keeping parents invested
*  in the children, but that phrase, and there are a lot of examples of parents who don't
*  do such a great job of parenting.
*  So what is the solution, right?
*  Well, there are a couple of ways to go about it.
*  So from a more sort of socialistic or democratic socialist or, you know, wider social safety
*  net point of view, you can invest resources in publicly funded childcare.
*  Like universal, right?
*  Give parents a break.
*  Help them, right?
*  I argue in the book following the work of Nancy Folber, the economist, that children
*  are public goods.
*  Everyone who is alive is benefiting from the work that we do as parents because we're making
*  future workers and consumers and soldiers and taxpayers, right?
*  If you can't get the state to expand the social safety net to make this easier on families,
*  you can do it in a more local way.
*  And that's where I think these utopian experiments show us ways forward, that there are ways
*  in which you and I individually, just in our own private lives, can make choices about
*  how we spend time with our friends, how we allow other adults into the lives of our children,
*  how we expand our networks of comrades and colleagues and family members and friends
*  and submerse our families in these wider networks of lateral care and support that incrementally,
*  as we do it individually, starts to change society in really profound ways, even without
*  the sort of top-down social policies of a state.
*  We can do it from the bottom up.
*  Let me ask about the other side of that.
*  So you have a section in that area of the book where you're talking about non-monogamy,
*  talking about expanding the romantic relationship.
*  You can tell me if this is wrong.
*  I felt like I detected the most discomfort for you in writing about that, that you felt
*  this was the taboo that was actually hardest to cross.
*  But tell me a bit about that section of the book.
*  And given how radical a lot of what comes before it is, why was that where it felt like
*  you were treading most carefully?
*  So I think of our sexualities and families and romantic relationships as this really
*  diverse spectrum.
*  However, as I said, I do think that we tend to be pair bonding.
*  And most people are fairly attached to this idea of romantic love.
*  And when I was researching this book and when I was talking to people and interviewing people
*  and really thinking this through, I realized that that particular constellation of romantic
*  is the thing that people are the most resistant to.
*  They really, really dig in when it comes to challenging this idea that I'm going to find
*  a soulmate.
*  And I think that's a particular function of the fact that in our world where we don't
*  live in these wider networks of expanded love and care and support, our romantic partners
*  are where we get our validation.
*  It's where we get our affection.
*  If I have to share my romantic partner with somebody else, that means that I'm getting
*  less.
*  It's really zero sum.
*  So some partners can be very, very protective of each other.
*  When you're in your 20s, you may have a lot of friends.
*  When you couple up, you might start to get couple friends.
*  And then your couple friends start to shrink, especially as you're raising kids.
*  So there's a way in which romantic couples really start to depend on each other for a
*  lot of their emotional needs.
*  And I think that the beauty of non-monogamous forms of relationships or even monogamous
*  pair bonds that are submerged again in these wider networks is that you are getting emotional
*  support and validation from other people so that your partner isn't the only person in
*  your life who is giving you all of this attention that we all need.
*  So like we freight our romantic relationships with so much.
*  They have to do so much.
*  They have to be so much that if we lived in either societies with expanded social safety
*  nets or if we lived in these wider communities, our relationships, our romantic, primary romantic
*  ties would be so much less burdened by all of these various tasks that they have to perform
*  in order for them to be successful.
*  Let me ask a question in favor of that and then a question more skeptically.
*  So you have a, I thought a very lovely quote from the scholar Kim Tall Bear who writes,
*  what is possible with a model in which love and relations are not considered scarce objects
*  to be hoarded and protected?
*  And one thing I found interesting about that quote was the idea of scarcity in there.
*  That a lot of what is being thought of in utopian imaginings of all sorts, from the
*  material utopianism of some of the other books you mentioned at the top here to the
*  parenting structures we're talking about to the communal structures we're talking about
*  is the idea that one thing we're trying to triumph over as human beings is scarcity,
*  particularly artificial scarcity.
*  And the idea that love and even romantic love in our lives is artificially scarce is a kind
*  of interesting idea that has been both for good and for bad looked at and experimented
*  with.
*  But I'm curious how you think about that within that wider project here of experimenting
*  around scarcity and abundance.
*  So a lot of my previous work is precisely about this idea of how in capitalist societies,
*  we often think of our romantic attachments in transactional ways.
*  And a lot of that has to do again with economic precarity and, you know, what are often called
*  marriage markets and whether men are marriageable or unmarriageable and the way that sexual
*  selection and choice works and how we view resources attached to relationships, right?
*  So there is this concept, I think, that particularly in our societies that men are providers and
*  that women choose their romantic partners on the basis of whether or not those people
*  can provide.
*  This gets into a really interesting question about scarcity.
*  What are the things that are being transacted on either side of these relationships?
*  Is it sex?
*  Is it attention?
*  Is it resources?
*  Is it sort of affective support?
*  Is it bi-parental care for children, you know, provisioning for offspring?
*  So I think that every single one of these communities, with very few exceptions, really
*  thinks of love and attention as a kind of boundless resource that should be shared.
*  And this really runs the gamut from secular experiments to religious experiments, even
*  experiments that, as I said, are synobitic monastic celibates, right?
*  Love is this thing that just multiplies, right?
*  If you give it out, you get it back.
*  That's the theory, right?
*  There's not like a pot of it that gets depleted as you pull it out, right?
*  Now, I guess in the extreme, some people can become affectively drained if they're
*  doing extreme forms of care work.
*  Psychologists have recognized that.
*  But for the most part, right, if we have lots of connections with others, and exactly what
*  Kim Tallbear says, right, if I am richly fed, who can I feed?
*  If I feel love and support, how many other people can I also love and support?
*  What I'm trying to say is that scarcity as a concept is something that gets attached
*  to emotions.
*  It gets attached to attention.
*  It gets attached to these sort of non-material resources, right, that we have.
*  Like, you know, you were saying like the attention, the affection that you give to your child.
*  It's really harmed what I give to my dogs.
*  Yes, yeah, right.
*  I'm not sure love is bounded, but time is.
*  Time and care is.
*  Time and care are definitely bounded, for sure.
*  And you know, I often get into debates about time.
*  Like when we say that we don't have time for people, I don't have time for my friends,
*  or you're cutting people out of your life.
*  The idea is that that time is a valuable commodity.
*  And you know, Jenny O'Dell's recent book about saving time and the way that we have come
*  to think of time as this fundamentally sort of fungible asset that we allocate in order
*  to achieve certain goals.
*  I think that that's a big problem.
*  And that's one of the things that many of these utopian communities are trying to claw
*  back, right, is to bring time out of the realm of commodification and into the realm of something
*  that we share more abundantly with others.
*  The flip of this is that when I have read accounts of a lot of the communes in the 70s
*  in America, when I even read accounts in your book, there's a sense that free love, that
*  group marriage, dating, polyamory, etc., has been destabilizing for them.
*  I mean, you also talk about communes, I forget which ones, but where the kids didn't want
*  to come back or people just left because they wanted to be able to have stable partners.
*  And they didn't want to be in a context where there was a lot of pressure to be sharing
*  their partner.
*  Sharing is always a weird language like that.
*  But to be shared also, right?
*  There's also a feeling this can become exploitive, right?
*  Even if you don't want it, you have to do it or use some kind of uptight prude.
*  Then there's also the very dark sides where you get charismatic leaders and all of a sudden
*  you have kind of harem situations.
*  So there's a different context of just people's romantic and relational dynamics in their
*  lives.
*  But within the context of the history of communes, how do you read that?
*  Because I think that is one of the big kind of stereotypical takeaways that a lot of these
*  collapse in a sort of nightmare of abundance becoming endless drama.
*  Exactly.
*  And so this is a perfect point to come back to where you said that there's that moment
*  of reticence that in the book.
*  And that's because in societies and communities where people were still primarily pair bonded
*  romantically, they lasted a lot longer.
*  And their children were much more willing to remain in those communities because like
*  the Oneida community, there were prohibitions on what Noi is called exclusive love, right?
*  Because they thought it was sort of like some aberration for people to be selfishly in love
*  and not to share their sexuality and their attentions with a wider group of people.
*  So they literally prohibited romantic pair bonding, which is something that I think is
*  a real mistake to prohibit it.
*  And so the key thing for me is the separation of our mating practices from our child rearing
*  practices.
*  I think that any prohibition on pair bonding is going to now maybe in a different world
*  in 100 years from now, 200 years from now, it could be different.
*  But I think that we're socialized in a particular way to really believe in those primary romantic
*  attachments.
*  Now, they can be open, right?
*  And we also in polygamous societies, there are multiple wives, right?
*  You have, I think I talk about like Mitterrand in the book, you have men who have wives and
*  mistresses, right?
*  They're like stable relationships.
*  Mitterrand being?
*  The former French president, right?
*  His mistress was at his funeral, invited by his wife.
*  Invited by his wife, exactly, right?
*  So even in societies where you have socially imposed universal monogamy, where legally
*  speaking only one wife for one man, it's sort of a social imposition of monogamy, you still
*  have these practices whereby people can have long standing relationships with more than
*  one person.
*  But the pair bonding, right, is the thing that is really hard to disrupt.
*  And that's why I think it's very important to say we can open it up.
*  But the more important thing is to say that whatever our romantic mating practices may
*  be, whatever our interpersonal relationships are, they don't necessarily have to be the
*  container for child rearing.
*  And because we have put those two things together, that's why we have designed our houses the
*  way that we have.
*  That's why we own our property the way that we do.
*  That's why we distribute resources the way that we do.
*  And so I think that there's just the big work of the book is trying to destabilize
*  that linkage between those two different sort of sets of practices.
*  I'll also say at the end that part of the work of the book is trying to help people
*  exercise a muscle of hope, of imagining future is very different than the ones we see now.
*  And you also have a nice line where you talk about, with everyone exhausted by the hustle
*  needed to meet their basic needs, people tend to view others as potential competitors.
*  And I would put in the same category other futures.
*  I mean, obviously, my interest in this conversation is that I'm very interested in intentional
*  living.
*  And I talked to a bunch of people back in the Bay Area who had started communities like
*  this, and I was awed by what they put into it to make this work.
*  Takes a lot of energy.
*  It takes a lot of effort.
*  And if you're interested in it because you're already expending more energy and effort than
*  you have on trying to hold a job and care for your kids, there isn't all that much to
*  be like, well, I'm going to start a whole new structure of living and recruit people for it.
*  And I'm curious how you think about that task of, on the one hand, you're responding to
*  the flip side of a crisis of care, is a crisis of exhaustion.
*  And on the other hand, to build a different future requires not just resources that are
*  literal in terms of money and wood to build homes and whatever, but time, but energy,
*  but that muscle not just of hoping, but of doing.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that, again, this comes back to a set of preferences.
*  I can spend my time and resources to move away from my extended family, to pursue a
*  career, to get enough money to buy a big house and a nice car and pay for childcare for my
*  children or whatever, to create a sort of world that is exhausting in the way that I
*  have to expend all my time and energy in order to achieve that.
*  You could think of that project as being shifted to maybe I would be less exhausted if it was
*  easier to do things like raising children, if we lived in a society with wider social
*  safety nets, if we lived in communities of expanded care.
*  And one of the things that I like to think about is this other 1%.
*  So your friends in the Bay Area, they are part of a really long tradition that goes
*  back, historically, we have records until like the sixth century BCE of people who said,
*  no, we're not going to live this way.
*  We're going to go off and we're going to do it differently.
*  We have these sort of core principles and whether they were Buddhist monastics or the
*  Pythagoreans in Croton or Plato conjuring up the Republic, reflecting on the way that
*  the Spartans lived, Thomas More and Tommaso Campanella and utopian socialists, anarchists,
*  communists, environmentalists, feminists, there are so many different groups.
*  They all kind of tend to coalesce around a very similar package of ideas, which I find
*  really remarkable in their consistency over time.
*  So there's always been this 1%, this other 1% out there, not the economic 1%, but this
*  sort of utopian 1%.
*  And what they do is they show us other ways of being.
*  Not all of us are going to uproot ourselves and go off and live in a commune, right?
*  But the idea that people are doing things differently and the practices that they're
*  experimenting with, they trickle down into society in really important ways.
*  There's this wonderful quote by Eduardo Galeano where he says, I'm paraphrasing that, what
*  is utopia, right?
*  I walk two steps towards utopia and utopia moves two steps away from me.
*  And then I walk 10 steps closer to it and it recedes 10 more steps.
*  No matter how far I walk, utopia keeps receding away from me.
*  So what is the point of utopia?
*  The point is to keep walking.
*  It's a lovely place to end.
*  Always our final question.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  The first one is Pirate Enlightenment by the late David Graeber.
*  The subtitle is The Real Libertalia.
*  It's about this interesting confederated pirate federation, kind of decentralized government
*  theoretically in Madagascar.
*  And it's just such a fun thought experiment that he's doing with very, very, very thin
*  empirical evidence and historical evidence.
*  Wow, what a sparkling mind he had and what a fun book to read.
*  I mean, it's always fun to read about pirates, right?
*  But like pirates in Madagascar and real pirates in the idea of like what pirate democracy
*  might have looked like.
*  I just thought that was a really fun one.
*  The second book is Ursula Gwyn's The Dispossessed, which I have been teaching for 25 years or
*  something in various classrooms for different reasons.
*  It is a wonderful kind of imagining of an anarchist society on a planet called Anaray's.
*  And it was written in 1974 and it sort of reflects on the deficiencies of both capitalism
*  and communism as it was in the 20th century in this really interesting way that sort of
*  makes young people and has always made me every time I reread it, really try to think
*  outside the box.
*  She read a whole bunch of Peter Kropotkin before she wrote the book and she was just
*  playing around with how would you actually make this work in practice?
*  And then the third book is Gender and the Politics of History by Joan Wallach Scott,
*  who as a grad student many years ago kind of broke my brain and really gave me this
*  sort of language of trying to understand patriarchy and trying to challenge patriarchy through
*  a certain way of thinking about history.
*  And so Joan's work, you know, she had this like sort of incredible essay called Gender,
*  a useful category of historical analysis, which is included in this book, which sort
*  of I think it's like one of the most downloaded papers of the American Historical Review ever.
*  It really just sort of created this whole new world of thinking about the way we live
*  our lives that has been really profoundly influential to me over the years.
*  Kristin Gatze, thank you very much.
*  Thank you so much for having me.
*  This was such a fun conversation.
