# We Need Better Narratives About Gender
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4PVn7_BX0Q)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  Hey, it is Ezra. I am still on Bookly, but I've really been enjoying the shows. It is
*  fun to be a listener of your own show. And this week I'm particularly excited because
*  the great Lydia Polgreen is behind the mic. Lydia is a long time international reporter
*  for the New York Times. Now she is a columnist colleague of mine here at Opinion and co-host
*  of Matter of Opinion. And she's going to do some great things behind the mic.
*  It's a terrifying time for trans and non-binary people in America. State legislatures across
*  the country have seen an uptick in bills regarding trans people. More than 20 states have now
*  passed some sort of restriction on gender-affirming care for children. And with almost 200 health
*  care bills introduced in 2023, this number will likely continue to rise.
*  This onslaught of legislation has gotten important news coverage. But there's actually a broad
*  spectrum of rich, interesting, and more personal questions that queer culture opens up. Questions
*  about how we think about identity and social categories, our anxieties about having children
*  different from ourselves, and how difficult it can be to make big life decisions.
*  All of which made me want to talk to Masha Gessen. They're a staff writer at the New
*  Yorker who identifies as trans and non-binary, and they're also a parent. Masha has spent
*  their career not just reporting on LGBTQ issues, but also witnessing how queer culture has
*  evolved alongside various shifts in politics and mainstream culture, both in the United
*  States and in Russia, where they were born. They advocate for a liberatory framework for
*  thinking about LGBTQ issues, which focuses on not just protecting trans people's rights,
*  but on securing freedom for trans people and all of society to break free from social norms.
*  Masha's thinking on questions of gender, identity, and transition are often nuanced,
*  unorthodox, and playful, which is also how I describe the conversation we have today.
*  As always, the show's email is ezraclineshow.nytimes.com. Here's my conversation with Masha Gessen.
*  Masha Gessen, thanks for being here.
*  It's great to be here, Lydia.
*  It's wonderful. We're going to have a very queer conversation, I hope.
*  All right.
*  Why are we talking about gender right now? Why is gender the thing that has, I don't
*  know, seized the conservative imagination? Why is this assault on gender, nonconforming
*  people, trans people, queer people happening in the world right now? What's your theory?
*  So my theory is that autocrats and aspiring autocrats need an effective way of communicating
*  a very simple idea, which is, I can take you back to an imaginary past. And in this particular
*  case, they're saying, I can take you back to an imaginary past where women were women
*  and men were men and families were families and life was predictable and you felt comfortable
*  and you didn't have to accept things that made you uncomfortable and made the future
*  seem unpredictable. And importantly, you didn't have to fear that there will be such chasm
*  between you and your child that you will not understand each other. And all of that,
*  that whole big promise of past-oriented politics can be communicated with this very simple
*  strategy of attacking trans people in particular, but then all of what they call gender ideology
*  and LGBT rights.
*  We're seeing an onslaught of anti-trans legislation in this country. More than 20 states have
*  of restriction on gender-affirming care for children and about 170 healthcare-related
*  bills have been introduced this year. So we can assume that more states are going to be
*  added to this list. What's your sense of what this legislation is doing? Is this something
*  substantive or is it really about sending a message?
*  Well, it's always both. I think the process of passing this legislation is very much about
*  signaling. It's exactly that thing that I was just talking about. It's like, I'm going
*  to take you back to the imaginary past. But of course it has real consequences. It has
*  real consequences both for people who lose access to healthcare and for people who start
*  living in fear, who feel like they have to move their kids out of state in order to keep
*  them safe. It's a snowballing thing, which is what happens when legislation actually
*  works. It creates not just a set of legal rules, but actual social change. It's just
*  social change that's really kind of horrifying to watch.
*  Yeah. And against a backdrop of what had seemed like progress, right? I mean, I think over
*  the course of our lifetimes, we've seen something that looks like a narrative of greater acceptance
*  of the broader umbrella of LGBTQ people. But perhaps this, if we choose to call it backlash,
*  is happening in the face of what's seen as progress.
*  I mean, let's be honest about it. It's not just that we've seen progress in our lifetimes.
*  It's that there has been such incredibly rapid change. Just in the last, I don't know,
*  five, seven years on trans issues, I mean, it's been head spinning. And if it's been
*  head spinning for me, then I can only imagine how head spinning it has been for people who
*  didn't even know such a thing existed as trans people. And suddenly they feel, and they really
*  do feel that, you know, like they're all around them.
*  Yeah, change is hard. It's interesting because, you know, I've been working on an essay about
*  regret and about, you know, sort of thinking about trans kids and what it is that we're
*  saying when we worry about regret. And one of the things that sort of come up in the
*  process of reporting that is just really thinking about the sort of different tracks that, I
*  don't want to say anti-trans thought, but there is sort of an element of anti-trans thought
*  that comes out in, that is not actually the kind of totalitarian, like we're going to
*  believe that gender transition exists. We're all pretty familiar with that sort of attack
*  on transgender people. I've been thinking a lot lately about the sort of softer side
*  of the group that doesn't even think of itself as being anti-trans. And I think that
*  particularly among, you know, I think the kind of people that you and I probably know
*  and are in our social circles, there's a lot of discomfort, right? And you just referred
*  to this, that, you know, just in our lifetimes, there's been a lot of change and a lot of
*  discomfort. And I think that that discomfort shows up less in the form of like, let's
*  ban all care and more in the form of, well, geez, I'd really hate for a child to make a
*  choice that they might regret. And you end up with a kind of perspective on transition
*  that is basically, yes, there's this small, clearly defined group of people who are
*  transgender. We can very closely look at them and decide who's who and sort them into the
*  group and make sure only the right ones who really truly are the ones who transition and
*  to borrow a phase, you know, transition should be safe, legal and rare. And talk to me a
*  little bit about that side of the conversation, because I think we spend a lot of time
*  talking about the sort of more authoritarian side of it and the Ron DeSantis of the world.
*  I spend a lot of time worrying about the other side of it.
*  I'd like to talk to you a lot about it, not a little.
*  Great.
*  Because I think there's so many things to talk about. And maybe I would start, since I'm
*  talking to you, I would start with how it's largely, this family is largely our fault. And
*  by us, I mean, queer people. And I think it goes back to this idea of choicelessness that we
*  sort of made the the main argument of the LGBT, well, the gay and lesbian rights movement, or
*  really the gay rights movement back in the early 70s. It was probably pragmatically
*  brilliant, because it was the shortest way to getting homosexuality removed from the
*  diagnostic manual to get the both the American Psychiatric Association, the American
*  Psychological Association to accept that homosexuality wasn't a pathology. And it was a
*  way to argue for civil rights. It wasn't the only possible way to argue for civil rights.
*  Nobody is born into a religion. Well, people are born into religions, but nobody argues that
*  it's an immutable characteristic.
*  No, but it has the advantage of actually being written into the United States Constitution.
*  That's the but so it's a rare I'm just saying it's a it's a very rare outlier to to what
*  you're saying, which is that this this kind of rights based discourse requires you to adopt a
*  kind of immutability.
*  immutability.
*  It's certainly the easiest way to make the argument. But I have an issue actually with the
*  rights based discourse in the first place, like I would really much rather live inside a
*  libertarian discourse than the rights based discourse. That's what I thought I was signing
*  up for.
*  Right. And you signed up for it. I mean, as a very young person working in the gay and lesbian
*  press and the you know, when what year was your first job in in journalism?
*  1983.
*  Okay, yeah, so I was 16.
*  Right. Precocious. So you felt like you were signing up for liberation.
*  And instead, I got the right to marry, which is great. I got the right to serve in the
*  military. Also, not terrible, if not for me personally. But yeah, no, that's I didn't get a
*  redefined family. I didn't get a redefined concept of gender. I didn't get a redefined
*  understanding of kinship and community, you know, like all the things that I thought I was
*  actually going to get by joining this movement. So, you know, I have a chip on my shoulder
*  about that. But I think we the LGBT rights movement, by choosing that strategy,
*  fundamentally changed people's lives for the better for millions of people. I mean, the
*  gains in a single lifetime have been staggering. But we also set a trap for ourselves,
*  which I think we're seeing now with trans issues. And that's the immutability trap. We're so
*  used to arguing, we don't really know how to argue anything else, that you're born in the
*  wrong body. And that is, you know, I don't mean to say that that is not true for some people.
*  For some people, it is absolutely true. But it's entirely possible that those are the people who
*  fall into the safe, legal and rare category. And there's an entire spectrum of people who
*  transition for other reasons, for a combination of reasons, who at some point, at least
*  experience it as a choice. And we don't know how to see our way to that. That creates a lot of
*  difficulties, because it's very difficult, for example, to argue that a non-binary person was
*  born in the wrong body. Because how do you even do that?
*  Yeah, because the body that you're born into is just the body that you're born into. But the
*  identity piece of it, I think, is where it becomes sort of messy and confusing to people, right? So
*  there is this notion that I see undergirding the conversations that I have with even, you know,
*  frankly, lesbian parents whose children come to them and say, I'm non-binary or I'm trans.
*  It really freaks them out. And of course, like I think your child being different from you is a
*  very, very scary experience. I'm personally not a parent, but you are. And I think I have many
*  friends who are parents. It is sort of terrifying. And yet, we have an ability to metabolize regret.
*  We have an ability to tolerate and understand that children will make decisions that they
*  regret. So, you know, for example, I gave up swimming when I was a child. I was a very good
*  swimmer. I could have been a varsity athlete. I can imagine a version of my life unfolding in
*  which I did something very different. And in some ways, I regret not following that path. But that's
*  life. I think most people would say, well, that's very different from something as fundamental to
*  your identity as changing your gender. I guess I wonder if it is.
*  Well, that's exactly the thing. So if the immutability trap is the trap we set for ourselves,
*  I think the regret trap is a trap we didn't set for ourselves, but we fell right into it.
*  I think the regret trap was definitely set by people who are opposed to nervous about, scared
*  of seeing more and more trans people, which is a statistical fact. And seeing people transition
*  younger. And I think it is easy to explain by saying that 10 years ago, a 14 year old
*  didn't have the option, didn't have the imaginary to be able to ask their parents
*  for help in transition. And now they do. But another way, of course, of looking at it from
*  the opposite side is it's social contagion, and children are making decisions, irreversible
*  decisions that they're going to regret. And we, proponents of trans rights, tend to respond to it
*  by saying, but very few people are going to regret it, which is also a statistical fact.
*  And that's how we fall right into the trap. What I think we should be saying is, possibly. So what?
*  What exactly are they going to regret? And what other things are they going to regret?
*  The two comparisons that I usually go to, and maybe you can think of better ones,
*  but teenagers sign up for the military. That's a huge life decision. I'm not really sure that 17
*  year olds are equipped to make that decision. It's binding. It really shapes people's lives for at
*  least a decade or so. And I think people are likely to regret it. And we think that they're
*  qualified to do it. In fact, we create all sorts of systems to facilitate their making this decision.
*  Another, of course, is medical interventions, which is something that, a decision that parents
*  often make for children, where children make together with their parents, going on antidepressants.
*  Not dissimilar from transitioning. If you think about transitioning as a way to be in the world,
*  in a way that is more comfortable, makes it easier for you to cope, and then gets us into all sorts
*  of other conversations. Let me know if I'm going too fast with these. But one of the objections
*  that we hear from clinicians, and it's their job to raise these objections, is what if there's
*  something else going on? What if there's depression? What if there's autism? And again, I think the go
*  to answer is usually, that's rare. We can tell genuine transness from autism spectrum disorder,
*  which, A, I don't believe, and B, look, it is probably easier to be a boy on the spectrum than
*  a girl on the spectrum. Like, not a bad choice. Go for it. Your life will be easier if you feel
*  like that's an option that works for you. And I can imagine listeners fainting at this, because
*  what am I saying? Am I saying it's a choice? For some people it is. It's a choice about being in
*  the world. And that gets us back to what parents and allies of parents are so terrified that their
*  children will regret. Cutting off their breasts, preventing puberty. That comes from our understanding
*  of just how essential these body parts are to who we are. But that's just how we construct gender.
*  Well, and it's how we show our gender in the world, right? I mean, I think,
*  one, in the process of researching this piece, I did some research into cosmetic surgery for children.
*  And how many children do you think receive cosmetic surgery? Teenagers, let's say, from 13 to 19.
*  What an interesting question. Just ballpark. What would you guess? Two percent. So in 2020,
*  fewer than one percent of teens in the United States received cosmetic procedures, according
*  to a report that I found that was published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
*  And there were some other numbers in this report about cosmetic procedures more generally that I
*  found fascinating. So first of all, 92 percent of all cosmetic procedures are done on women,
*  and rhinoplasty is the most popular surgical procedure. And you might say, what does that
*  have to do with gender? Well, I mean, the ideas that we have about female attractiveness are,
*  of course, very much bound up in gender. There are also thousands of breast augmentation and
*  reduction surgeries for girls and very, very interestingly, 2800 surgeries performed on boys
*  to remove excess breast tissue. So, I mean, that obviously is very much bound up in affirming the
*  gender of these kids. And when you move into cosmetic surgeries for adults, there's been this
*  huge explosion in popularity of a surgery to lengthen one's legs, and it's really growing
*  among men. It's quite invasive and it adds a few inches of height. But again, this is a gendered
*  expectation that men in our culture are going to be of a certain stature. And this is even more
*  squeamish making, but there's been a huge explosion in the popularity of penile enlargement in adults.
*  But I guess this all sort of gets to my broader sense that we're all feeling a little bit
*  uncomfortable about our bodies and the way that we show our gender in the world. And this to me,
*  really speaks to something that goes far beyond the experience of queer people, of trans people,
*  of gender nonconforming people, and to the kind of human condition of having to show up in the world
*  with a gendered body. And we do ourselves no favors when we pretend that it's not messy and
*  complicated. When we pretend that people under the age of 18 have no ability to make decisions,
*  and people over the age of 18 have all the ability to make decisions. And I often assign to my
*  students, Shilomith Firestone's chapter, Down with Childhood from the Dialectic of Sex. And
*  it's just, I can't remember, 18 or 25 pages that just keeps pounding the reader with like,
*  where did you get this idea that children were completely different from adults? Wasn't always
*  so. The boundary was not always at 18. It would be really useful if, as we're making things messier,
*  and more complicated, if we at least question the category of childhood. I'm not going to
*  go so far as to argue that it's completely meaningless. I can see very clearly that
*  all three of my children, ages 11, 22, and 25, have much less life experience, and
*  less formed brains than I do. But do they necessarily correspond exactly to their
*  chronological ages? Is the 11-year-old who's not under the influence of raging hormones,
*  not sometimes capable of much better decisions and better argumentation than the 22-year-old?
*  For sure. And so let's just make it worse. But also as uncomfortable as things like
*  rhinoplasty in little girls makes you and me, I think it probably also makes sense to imagine
*  what it's like to be in a family, to be that girl who is probably, in a majority of cases,
*  suffering horribly from whatever she imagines her defect to be. To be that parent
*  who might see that surgery as a life-saving surgery. And what is the cost of that? It's
*  the cost of surgery and possibly regretting having a perfect nose at the age of 25, or whenever that
*  crisis is over. That seems a very low cost for what I imagine. I only imagine this,
*  the pain that's going on in that family. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting, right? Because I think
*  that because we're so focused on the role of the law in all of this, one thing that gets lost is
*  that these are decisions that are made within families. And having seen this up close with
*  friends, there's nothing casual about the way in which these issues are being discussed or dealt
*  with within a family. And I think the thing that I find so troubling and chilling is the idea that
*  you want to interpose the government into what should be a discussion between a family,
*  parents and children. Maybe you want to bring your rabbi into it. Maybe you want to bring a doctor,
*  a psychiatrist into it. Maybe there are all kinds of people who are appropriate participants
*  in that conversation, depending on your situation and the nature of your family.
*  One person that I think is completely inappropriate is a politician. I mean,
*  I don't know. As an old queer, I am always a little bit careful about arguing for family
*  against government. I mean, I think ideally it wouldn't be an anti-government argument. It
*  would be an argument for better politics. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think that's right. And I think that's
*  actually a very good note because families are not always supportive. Yeah. So that's right.
*  And the notion of a child being able to access some form of autonomy from the family
*  is, I think, very, very important.
*  Yeah. Reuters did some reporting last year where they analyzed insurance data to look at gender
*  affirming care for children. And the numbers that they found were actually incredibly small. I mean,
*  I think that there was clearly an increase in the number of kids that were taking puberty blockers,
*  but it was 1,400 in 2021. But that's still in absolute numbers, a very small number of kids.
*  Looking at the rhetoric, you would think that there are teenage girls that are getting their
*  breasts loft off left and right after watching a couple of TikTok videos. But the actual numbers
*  that Reuters found in 2021, and again, this is a limited data set, it's just insurance and Medicaid,
*  was 282. Right. That's tiny. And it also gets us to another point, which is not part of the
*  public imagination at all, which is that that goes along with a fairly high percentage, I can't
*  tell you off the top of my head, of young people identifying as trans or gender nonconforming.
*  And results of the Washington Post poll that showed that more than half of people who identify
*  as trans have had no medical intervention. But I think it's interesting to me that
*  your discomfort with this minimizing, and it's interesting, I guess I'm saying interesting what
*  I mean is, I feel it too, that this sense of discomfort with saying, no, no, no, nothing to
*  see here. This is just a little group over in the corner that you don't need to worry about.
*  I guess if I ask myself, why does that make me uncomfortable? I guess it's
*  partly because of my own uncertainties about all of these questions, right? And that
*  looking at the data of medical interventions that nominally cisgender children get,
*  it really makes me think that we're talking about something bigger than one small group of people,
*  and sort of exploding that out to all of us feels, as you put it, liberatory.
*  I'll tell you why it makes me uncomfortable to argue that there's nothing to see here,
*  and it's a very small group of people, because that's, first of all, it never works.
*  Let's just avoid attention means you give up your opportunity to shape language and narrative,
*  and you give it over to someone else. And that's exactly what we've seen happen.
*  It also, the argument strikes me as disingenuous, because there's something to see here.
*  There's, as you were saying, right, there's something to see here in the way that young people
*  and old people interact with medicine, in the new possibilities that we see for our bodies
*  that include gender, but extend far past gender. And there's a lovely passage in Maggie Nelson's
*  The Argonauts, where she kind of accidentally or coincidentally compares gender transition to aging.
*  But that's exactly right. It's a development of the body. It's something that happens over time.
*  So it's silly to argue that there's nothing to see here, because I think it is one of the
*  formative experiences of our society at this moment, even if it's a small group of people.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's also interesting, right, because I think that we often underestimate
*  the rapidity with which we can metabolize change. I mean, one example that I think about is,
*  because again, thinking about regret, my parents met, my mother's Ethiopian and my father's a
*  white American from a very conservative family in Wisconsin. And in 1973, when my father brought
*  home his black African fiancee, and my grandparents were wonderful people who I don't think were
*  prejudiced at all. But I think that in that milieu, the concern about the sort of regrettability of
*  biracial children was very real. We were less than a decade past the loving decision.
*  There was a 19th century literature about the sort of tragic mulatto, the child that is,
*  at best, the product of doomed love, or at worst, evidence of a crime of rape. And a sense that,
*  like, oh, well, this just isn't a good idea, because we had very fixed ideas about race.
*  At that time, I think there was still a belief that there was a biological component to race.
*  I think I looked up the polling in 1973 or around then. About 30% of people thought that
*  interracial marriage was okay. And I could see how it would seem like this huge, you know, sort
*  of life, like you're taking a huge risk here. You know, it was officially sort of like stamped by
*  science that there's no biological reality to race, that once all the genome mapping was done.
*  And in 2021, when Gallup pulled the question about interracial marriage again, 90-something percent
*  of people said, no, it's totally fine, that they have no problem with interracial marriage.
*  I mean, we're talking about a series of events that have happened over my lifetime, right? From
*  being a potentially regrettable person to, which is a very strange phrase, but to, you know, the
*  vast majority of the country saying, this is no big deal. So I don't know, like, and I'm not a person
*  who believes in the sort of inevitability and linearity of progress, but there are some
*  interesting parallels there, right? I mean, a belief about sort of a biological or determinative
*  basis, or at least the search for one to prove that one side is inferior to the other,
*  a binary that is collapsing in a way that makes a lot of people uncomfortable. Yeah, I don't know.
*  You know, this weekend, we watched The Matrix with my 11-year-old son, a movie that I'd never
*  been able to get through before. But I dread that the new reading of it is that it's a trans allegory.
*  But anyway, we watched it. And just for people who don't know, the sort of retrofitting of the
*  trans allegory is that the makers of this film later came out as trans, the siblings who made
*  the film. Right, both of them came out as trans and said that as much. Yes. Said that there was a
*  kind of trans. I shouldn't call it a retrofitting. You're right. Yeah. Well, I mean, it sounds like
*  because they were both to various extents closeted when they were making the movie, it is in a way
*  retrofitting. They read themselves retroactively. But then we started reading up with the movie.
*  And one of the things that we discovered, probably widely known fact to fans of the movie,
*  was that the character Switch, who is the sort of androgynous woman in the movie, was actually
*  supposed to present as male in the computer world and female in the real world. And the studios
*  nixed it, which the movie came out in 1999. So I was a full grown adult by that time. One of my
*  oldest kids had been born. And it just, it almost defies my imagination. Like I can't imagine into
*  the past a situation where the studios think that that's too risky a move. A character who presents
*  as one gender in one world and another, a sci-fi movie, right? Where all sorts of things happen
*  that don't happen in the real world. Whereas that actually does happen in the real world.
*  And was certainly happening in 1999. And then the following day, we went to see the movie Bottoms,
*  which I don't know if you've seen, it's absolutely delightful. Loved it.
*  And it's just the most casually queer high school movie, but it's not even shocking anymore.
*  Yeah. Like it's, yes, you can go to movie theaters playing all over the place. And so, you know,
*  that change in a very young person's lifetime is staggering. But like you, I'm not a believer in
*  the linearity of progress. And I think that it is possible to lose all or most of the gains. And,
*  you know, I've seen it happen in Russia, where I had to leave Russia for this very reason.
*  But I also want to pick up on the biological component.
*  Yes, please.
*  Because I'm sure people are listening to you and thinking, well, yeah, okay, we've debunked the
*  biological component of race, but obviously there's a biological component to gender.
*  And yes, I mean, there's also a biological component to race in the sense that you can see it,
*  but you're not seeing categories. Categories is what we make up.
*  And I grew up, in fact, I grew up and became an adult and had up until the year, I think, 2000,
*  a passport that indicated my so-called nationality, which was Jewish. And in fact,
*  all of my documents, including my personnel file at work, my school files, my healthcare records,
*  all of them indicated that I was Jewish, not as a religion, but as an ethnicity.
*  Because where I grew up, it was perceived as an essential, immutable characteristic.
*  And I'm saying both immutable and essential, because it was essential to identifying me
*  to the state, to the systems that I interacted with, the same way the gender is.
*  If you're not paying attention, you may not notice that your, if you get a ticket
*  for improperly recycling, they will actually attempt to indicate your gender on it in the city.
*  Did this happen to you?
*  Yes, it did happen to me.
*  Masha, I'm very embarrassed that you were improperly recycling.
*  I wasn't.
*  I'm shocked.
*  No, I wasn't. It was a while ago. I had just moved to the city. But I was like, really?
*  Gender? I mean, it's not just your passport, your driver's license, all your healthcare records,
*  but things like your recycling tickets and all sorts of things that, you know, there's absolutely
*  no reason why my badge for entering the New Yorker offices at One World Trade Center should
*  indicate my gender. But it does.
*  But it does. Yeah, I mean, I think these binary identities are very important to us,
*  and they're anchored. They're ways to anchor and make meaning in the world, right? I mean,
*  I think that being able to sort things into categories is a very human thing.
*  And it's interesting, right? Like, I had a very strange experience when I was 10 years old.
*  I grew up mostly in Kenya. We moved to Kenya when I was a toddler. And we moved back to the United
*  States when I was 10, and I was going into sixth grade. And I was in gym class, and a kid referred
*  to me by a racial slur. And everyone freaked out immediately. The teacher freaked out, you know,
*  and sort of sprung into ag- it was the word that you can imagine that it was.
*  And my response to it was just confusion, because I had never heard this word before.
*  And on a deeper level, I think that I actually did not understand the concept of race. I mean,
*  I'm biracial. I, you know, now think of myself that way. But I grew up in a context where there
*  were certainly identity categories that were extremely important, right? I mean, nationality,
*  tribe, language, all of these things that were very hard identities that were, you know, but the sort
*  of binary concept of race as it exists in the United States was just completely invisible to me.
*  So, so there I was 10 years old, learning something about myself that was plain as day
*  to anybody who could see my face that I didn't know about myself. So when people talk about
*  knowing an identity and all of these things, I find myself
*  puzzled. Because if someone else can know something immutable about me before I know it myself,
*  what does that tell us about the nature of identity and the idea that there is some
*  sort of sovereign self that you can anchor yourself to? Well, and that's another problem with the whole
*  born in the wrong body discourse that I've always felt and after a certain point was able to put
*  words to it, that gender is something that happens between me and other people. It doesn't actually
*  happen inside my body. It's what people see, what I want them to see, what I feel when they see one
*  thing and not the other thing. All of that is my gender. And so my gender has changed over my 56
*  years, but it also changes. I mean, I'll tell you a ridiculous and somewhat humiliating story. So,
*  I guess this was two years ago. I was at a conference in Kiev and, you know, I've never
*  changed my name. So my name to a Russian speaker or any Slavic language speaker is undoubtedly,
*  you know, completely 100% Russian and I'm known to, I was known at this conference. So I wasn't
*  going to make anything of it. Like I just knew I was going to be presenting as female to all the
*  people at this conference who knew who I was. And that was fine, except when I had to pee,
*  because at this conference venue, they had people minding the door, the entrances to the bathrooms.
*  So there I was. And I tried to go into the ladies room because I was female at this conference. And
*  this immediately blocks my way, because obviously I look the way I look, like what I'd accept to
*  people who are primed to see me as a woman. So I'm standing there thinking, what am I going to do?
*  Because I can't go into the men's room because they all know me. And if they know me, then they
*  know me as female, but a person who doesn't know me clearly knows me as male. And so that's, you
*  know, that's how gender happens. I mean, I finally told her that I really knew what I was doing.
*  And I belong there. But that's how gender operates. And it's also, you know, it's a funny
*  comment on the impossibility of presenting as male one minute and female the next,
*  when I was actually like doing it in real time.
*  LESLIE KENDRICK-KLEIN Yeah, we haven't talked about your own transition and how you identify.
*  But I can tell people who are not like me sitting across from you that you have a masculine
*  presentation, what would be received as a masculine presentation. I think I also have a fairly masculine
*  presentation and have had very, not exactly that experience, but lots of bathroom confusion.
*  But as you were talking, I was thinking about this great quote that I got for this piece that
*  I'm working on from a historian named Jules Jill Peterson. And she said this wonderful thing to me
*  that was we were talking about this issue of sort of where gender comes from and, you know, might it
*  actually be a problem for everyone as opposed to a problem just for people who have gender?
*  It used to be that people who had gender were just women and then it was now it's transgender
*  and queer people. But she said this wonderful thing. She said,
*  might be comforting and reassuring to imagine that trans people are fundamentally different.
*  But I think the real startling possibility is that they are not and that we all depend
*  on the generosity of strangers to give us our gender every single day.
*  That's beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  So I want to talk a little bit about the kind of radical edges of this conversation about identity,
*  right? Because I think that you and I have a particular experience and we're of a particular
*  generation. I think we're a little bit generationally distant just in the sense that
*  you experience things as a young queer person that because of the passing of time in history
*  and particularly because of the AIDS epidemic, I think we're pretty different from what I
*  experienced just maybe 10 years later. But I'd love to just sort of hear you talk a little bit
*  about the kind of where we're at in that kind of overall arc of the story of queer life.
*  Because I think you have an interesting perspective and vantage point on it. And
*  I think I've had some trepidation about sort of prematurely making a turn toward a kind of
*  universalist liberationist thinking because we're living in a time of great danger. And
*  I suppose one could think of it as a sort of dialectical moment where the contradictions of
*  the old order are showing themselves and that something new is being born. But dialectical
*  moments are fraught with a lot of danger and for a lot of vulnerable people. So if you're a person
*  who's liberation minded but aware of the perils of the present, what do you do?
*  I think you do both. I think that it would be silly and irresponsible to, for me, say as a
*  journalist and a public person, to literally act on my opinion that rights-based frameworks
*  are not so great and libertarian frameworks are so great. Because there are actual rights that
*  people can actually exercise that are under attack and rights that they lack, that they could
*  conceivably gain. And as a journalist, as a public person, I can speak in favor of those rights and
*  maybe make a small difference. So it will be completely irresponsible to not do that.
*  I also think it would be irresponsible not to exercise my imagination as much as I can and
*  maybe try to remind us in moments when we have the time and energy for contemplation,
*  that having some rights within a political community that's constructed the way it is
*  constructed now is not our ultimate goal. That maybe we can imagine a better world. Because if
*  we don't imagine it, if we don't imagine it actively now, we're not going to be able to
*  build it in the future.
*  Lylea Steele Yeah. At the same time, you have a very real experience of what happens.
*  Tell me about your experience of going back to Russia and then leaving again. I mean,
*  that was a moment where it felt that a certain kind of freedom or liberation, you could at least
*  work towards it. But my understanding is that it sort of got snatched back and you had to leave.
*  So I was born in the Soviet Union. My family immigrated to the States when I was 14.
*  And then 10 years later, I went back as a young journalist and just kind of stayed. And in fact,
*  I went back, the first time I went back was on a story. But the second time I went back a few
*  months later in 1991 was to help organize and run the first gay and lesbian conference and film
*  festival that was held in Moscow and St. Petersburg. And this was like two weeks before
*  the failed hardline coup. And so it all felt of a piece. It felt like that sort of, you could show
*  queer movies in the movie theater in the center of Moscow, and the Soviet Union was collapsing.
*  And these things were actually related. And I think they were. And I ended up staying there for
*  22 years. At first, I didn't expect I was going to stay forever. And then I kind of did expect
*  that I was going to stay forever. And it wasn't that progress was that rapid. It was there were
*  all sorts of other things going on. And I think that LGBT people never quite had the time to
*  form communities that could then result in a political movement. They were basically sort of
*  community building organizations in a number of cities when suddenly the Kremlin went on the
*  attack against LGBT people. And these organizations, these like coffee clutches had to turn into
*  political organizations and really quite extraordinary things happened and a lot of
*  incredible activism and heroism. What happened to me personally was that
*  in 2013, the Russian parliament passed legislation against propaganda of non-traditional
*  sexual relations among minors, which was, and I didn't realize this right away, but as
*  legislation sort of went through the process, I realized that that basically placed all LGBT
*  parents outside the law. And by that point, I had three kids and one of them was adopted.
*  And then they immediately passed another law banning adoption by same sex couples or raising
*  kids in same sex couples because the male older kid wasn't legally adopted in Russian territory
*  by two women, but in point of fact was. And I was actually singled out as sort of the
*  the
*  protagonist of this particular piece of legislation. So we had to pack up and leave.
*  I mean, not nearly as dramatically or nearly as fast as people who had to leave because of
*  actual violence or people who had to leave after the full scale invasion started, who
*  packed up and left in a matter of days. But I did have to leave with my family and leave my home,
*  leave my entire community. And at this point, these things have sort of moved in parallel.
*  So earlier this year, the Russian parliament has literally outlawed trans people. It is illegal to
*  transition. It is illegal to accept or supply any kind of medical intervention. It is illegal
*  to change your documents, etc. So it's like they've really banned transness. And at the same time,
*  it appears that there's a criminal case against me for knowingly spreading false information about
*  the Russian military. And so, and you know, to me, I think that is a very fairly harmonious
*  predicament. Like that's actually how it works. I happen to belong to two groups
*  that the Russian government is trying to outlaw trans people and journalists.
*  What does that experience make you think and feel about where we are right now in the United States?
*  I mean, obviously, we're a very different country, but you know, in terms of what's thinkable?
*  Well, I used to I used to say that that my friend and mentor, Larry Kramer, taught me
*  how to catastrophically imagine. And I thought that was, and to those who don't know, Larry Kramer was
*  a playwright, novelist, and a founder of both GMHC, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, which was an early
*  service organization for people with AIDS, and then ACT UP, the AIDS activist organization.
*  And you were also a member of ACT UP, Masha.
*  And I was also a member of ACT UP. And what I found remarkable about Larry is that
*  I thought he had imagined AIDS before AIDS ever happened. And so when AIDS started happening,
*  he was, and I think I can use this word as, as I'm going to be, he was hysterical, right? He was,
*  he was screaming, he was calling people names, he was, he was writing screeds that said that
*  82 people were sick and that means we're all going to die. And that was his catastrophic
*  imagination at work. He could have been wrong, but it so happens. He was right.
*  Tragically, he was right.
*  Tragically, he was right. And so I think that Russia and Larry
*  has given me the gift of catastrophic imagination. Anything is thinkable. It doesn't
*  mean it's going to happen. It doesn't mean that five, 10 or 20 years from now,
*  it's going to be illegal to be trans or a journalist in the United States, but it is possible.
*  Well, and I think that, that, you know, something that, that has certainly sharpened my attention
*  is, you know, the way that the reality of abortion in this country has changed. For example,
*  we all thought as a bedrock certainty that this was the Roe versus Wade was decided law, that
*  there was a, it was unthinkable to go back to a time when abortion was outlawed. And that was,
*  of course, foolish. Of course, it's thinkable. I have been seeing a lot of interesting thinking
*  about the kind of interlinking between the struggle for bodily autonomy for queer, gender
*  nonconforming and trans people and the struggle for abortion rights. What, what, do you see
*  possibilities there? Do you see some, some room for solidarity?
*  Absolutely. But first, let me just make a comment on, on this unthinkability, because if we look back
*  at the Dobbs decision, and if we look back at the election of Donald Trump, those are two examples
*  of when reasonable people were saying that something was impossible after it had become
*  a clear identifiable, describable reality that Donald Trump was going to get the Republican
*  nomination. And he had it locked in and reasonable people were saying there's no way. And after Amy
*  Kuhlman Barrett had been confirmed, reasonable people were saying there was no way they were
*  going to overturn Roe. But I think the moment she was confirmed, we knew. So it's important to
*  force yourself to think things that seem unthinkable.
*  Well, and also, and also to understand that events are not predictable. So I mean, it could be that
*  Donald Trump won the presidency, but did not sort of get the lottery ticket of being able to name
*  three Supreme Court justices in a single, you know, misbegotten term. So, so I mean, it's not
*  just the things that you can predict. It's also add into that the things that, you know, maybe some
*  of those bacon, well, at least one of them was predictable because it had been held over by the,
*  by the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. But yeah, no, I think that's right.
*  And, you know, and I agree, things are not preordained. I think there's,
*  it definitely behooves us to think about the best case scenario in addition to the worst case
*  scenario, but like face that the worst case scenario is realistic. As for a movement for
*  bodily autonomy, yes, of course. But again, we have to do something with our thinking about
*  immutability and being born in the wrong body. There's a bit of a leap from that
*  to this is my body, my choice.
*  Well, and I think that there's, I mean, one of the things that's been most troubling to me
*  has been seeing the way in which, the way in which women who think of themselves as feminists,
*  and I'm not, I'm not talking about the ones that we call TERFs, you know, although I don't love
*  that term because I don't think that they actually are feminists. A lot of this sort of soft shoulder
*  concern, you know, but what about women is coming from women who are probably in your social circle
*  just as they are in mine. And, you know, I have those hard conversations, but, but yeah, it sort
*  of feels like rather than being an opportunity for solidarity, it often ends up being an opportunity
*  for assertion of like relative privilege within a hierarchy that, that we all live with.
*  And, and look, I don't want to actually dismiss that as an argument.
*  No.
*  I think that dismissing out of hand the argument that people raised as boys have a completely
*  different social experience, have a completely different experience of being in the world,
*  than people raised as girls, not all girls and not all boys and you know, all of that, but by and
*  large we're talking about different social experiences and there we have opportunities
*  to hash that out. If we sort of assume that we're allies and if we assume that we're in
*  a common struggle for control over our own bodies, then we can discuss the ways in which we're
*  different. But I think one side saying you're not me and I'm not talking to you and the other side
*  saying I am you and you have to accept me as you, not terribly constructive. Even, you know,
*  and I'm not saying that one side is not more wrong than the other. One side is more wrong than the
*  other. But they're both a little bit wrong. Yeah. No, that's right. And I think, you know,
*  in conversations with friends of mine, you know, both friends who have children who are assigned
*  female at birth and who've either come out as non-binary or transitioned, there is this kind of
*  feeling that like, particularly for mothers, that my child is rejecting
*  womanhood, that they're rejecting femininity. And I think that that's painful, right? I think
*  that that's something, I think it's probably true across genders, but I think particularly for a
*  certain kind of feminist woman who's excited to raise a feminist daughter, that person who you
*  thought of as a daughter telling you, no, that's not who I am, I think is painful. And it's a thing
*  that I agree with you, it doesn't help anybody to tell that person, no, you should just be happy
*  about it. And then you should have no feelings. But I think it does make sense to put it in the
*  context of other things that are like it. Andrew Solomon has this wonderful book, Far From the Tree,
*  which is all about a variety of the horizontal identities. So identities that are not passed on
*  from parents to children. And it's all about the difficulty of navigating that
*  distance that forms between parents and children. So what is transness like, right? That's the
*  question that I'm most interested in, and the one that gets me into the most trouble, because
*  the only way that I think we learn about things is by comparing them to other things.
*  And it again does us a disservice to say transness is like nothing else. Well, of course,
*  it's like nothing else. But it's also like a bunch of other things. Transness is like crossing
*  borders. Transness is like being a stranger in your own country. Transness is like finding a
*  religion that is different from the religion that your parents raised you in. Transness is
*  moving to a country that's in learning a language that's very different from your parents' language.
*  And transness is also like a million other things. And making those comparisons
*  helps us understand what transness is, but also helps us just accept it, right? Because we accept
*  all sorts of other things that put a distance between parents and their children.
*  One thing that goes hand in hand with this idea of contagion is this notion that a child will see
*  something on TikTok and decide that they want to change their gender. This seems particularly to
*  apply to transmasculine kids, kids that are assigned female at birth. And I think, again,
*  one can make a minimizing argument. Oh, this is only for a really, really small number of people.
*  But the numbers are real. According to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health,
*  adolescents assigned female at birth seek out transgender care 2.5 to 7.1 times more frequently
*  than those assigned male at birth. And I guess the question that I would ask is, when isn't gender
*  socially contagious? I mean, how did you learn to act out your gender? And you've had a few different
*  ways of acting it out. We learn it from other people. I mean, I can tell you the exact moment
*  when, well, I mean, the exact moment. I don't actually remember the exact moment in childhood
*  when I like I wore boys' clothes and insisted that people use a boy's name. And then after I
*  started school, I couldn't do that anymore, or I could only do it after school. And then
*  my parents were reading a Polish magazine. So we lived in Moscow, and Poland was like,
*  comparatively a free place. And I believe it was 1978. And my mother was like reading stuff out loud,
*  and she read this short item on transsexual at the time surgery. And I think it was like passing
*  through the kitchen. I said, when I grow up, I'm going to do that. And my mom said, Okay.
*  Wow. Lucky Masha.
*  Yeah, I was very lucky in that respect. And, you know, would I have been able to imagine that
*  if my mother hadn't read that item out of a magazine? No. It would have taken many,
*  many more years to know that something else was possible. And then another, you know,
*  several decades later, after many years of happily living as a lesbian, I learned the
*  concept of non-binary. Like, well, that's a great idea. I think I could be that. I didn't invent it.
*  I wasn't really smart enough to invent it. Someone else invented it for me.
*  Yeah. Well, and I think, you know, all of these things that we discover about ourselves over time,
*  it's interesting, right? Because I think part of the sort of discourse around contagion and grooming
*  and all of that kind of stuff, it's contradictory, right? Because on the one hand, if gender is so
*  powerful and binary and immutable, then, you know, how could it be so easily disrupted by
*  you know, by teeny bopper trends? But, you know, everything from the Beatles' mop top craze to
*  Bama Rush, you know, are examples of gender contagion ways that they've influenced the way
*  that people live out their gender. But I think that there's also sort of examples on the other
*  side of it. So, I mean, I think about my own relationship to queerness. And I had a gay uncle
*  and he was out from my early childhood. Like, I've never known him as being a person in the closet.
*  And I was incredibly lucky in that regard. You know, I was born in 1975. I grew up with an example
*  of a proud out person in a long term loving relationship over time and, you know, who had a
*  great career and a life and, you know, who I think worked very hard to maintain that against, you
*  know, significant barriers that made it not an easy thing to do. But so there was really nothing
*  in my childhood that would tell me like, oh, it's actually scary or not okay to be gay. Like,
*  I had this very clear example. But I didn't have some sort of early childhood sense that I was
*  queer. I mean, I had some gender stuff, you know, and it was hard for me to tell like,
*  did I have a crush on, you know, Lenny Kravitz or did I want to be Lenny Kravitz? And the answer
*  was a little bit of both. And isn't that the way all attraction works? It's a mysterious
*  potpourri. And, you know, throughout my adolescence, I had, you know, kind of romantic
*  relationships with boys, some of them happy, some of them unhappy, college also. And then in college,
*  I met my wife and we have been together ever since. And, you know, I kind of settled into a
*  life as a lesbian and definitely think of myself that way. But I certainly don't feel that I was
*  born that way. And, you know, in a sort of sliding doors world where I met somebody else,
*  and that feels like a very sad life to me because, you know, my wife is great, but it's possible.
*  Danielle Pletka Wait a second, you don't believe in the one?
*  Danielle Pletka Well, I do believe in the one. But, you know, I wouldn't impose that belief on
*  anyone else. I think I just got particularly lucky. So it's interesting, right? Whenever I
*  hear people talk about this idea of contagion, you know, the idea like if I don't know that I
*  knew about being gender nonconforming, but I knew that I had two brothers and that I liked their
*  clothes better than mine. And what influenced me was I sort of groomed to be queer. None of it
*  makes any sense to me because I feel as though I sort of groped my way through the tumult of my own
*  self and psyche with all of the inputs that came from lots of different places and
*  ended up here.
*  Peter Pichai Well, I think the problem is that we just assign such disproportionate importance
*  to both sexuality and gender. And so if they're so important, if they're so central to our identities,
*  then how could they be accidental? How could they be chosen? How could they be mutable?
*  We need them to be cores of who we are. And for that, we have to invent all sorts of narratives
*  about how they were always there. But the way you just told the story was so lovely. You met
*  your wife. You could have not met your wife. You got really lucky. But to think that these
*  absolutely central identity forming things happen because you got lucky is so destabilizing
*  to the whole way that we've constructed them.
*  Danielle Pletka Yeah. Well, and that's the thing, right? I mean, we'd like to think that there's
*  some grand design or lacking a grand design, at least a set of principles by which we can
*  make sense of the world. But I have...
*  Peter Pichai But what if we just agree to be playful and have fun with the one life
*  each of us has given?
*  Danielle Pletka Yeah. And I think that's right. I mean, I don't know if you saw this, but there was
*  a very beautiful essay in the New Yorker of books by Jacqueline Rose that was originally a lecture
*  and it was about Stuart Hall and his legacy. And Stuart Hall, of course, was the founder of
*  cultural studies and a great sort of thinker in Britain, originally from the Caribbean,
*  and very influential to me and clearly also to the wonderful writer and thinker Jacqueline Rose.
*  But at the end of the piece where the piece deals with migration and with transgender identity and
*  all the gender and all these kinds of things, she quotes a message that she'd gotten from a friend
*  in the United States, I think in New York, and the friend had just transitioned from female to male.
*  And I'm paraphrasing here. What a wonderful thing to be able to live another life in this life.
*  Peter Pichai That's exactly how I feel about it.
*  Danielle Pletka Me too. I mean, I think that's the notion that we would all get to live different
*  lives in this one life, because at the end of the day, I'm a strong non-believer in binaries, but
*  there's one binary that I'm quite certain about, and that is the binary between life and death.
*  And we've only got one of these, as far as we know. So we've got to live it. You were talking
*  about, I mean, we've been sort of talking about things that are hard and depressing.
*  I'm curious for your impressions about kind of the state of queer life, because I feel very,
*  very, on the one hand, obviously, I see all the terrible things that are happening. And on the
*  other hand, I look around and think how lucky I am to be a queer person living in this particular
*  moment, because it feels so rich. How do you experience it?
*  Peter Pichai Do I? Hmm. I mean, I agree that I'm incredibly
*  lucky to that exact experience of being able to live another life is something that
*  is an accident of the time I was born. If I were 10, 15 years older, it might not have happened.
*  If I were 10 or 15 years younger, or maybe 20 years younger, it might have happened very
*  differently. So I feel oddly lucky to have landed in this time of incredible sort of progress and
*  transition. Stephanie McLaughlin
*  So one of the things we do on this show is ask people to recommend three books that they
*  think the audience should read. So do you have three books for me?
*  Peter Pichai I do. So I have one contemporary book,
*  one very old book, and one book that hasn't come out yet. So there's a contemporary book by a
*  Spanish activist and intellectual, Mikel Mise, called The Myth of the Wrong Body.
*  A short book translated into English, a very clear critique of the myth of the wrong body.
*  I love Jan Morris's memoir, Conundrum. Jan Morris was the British travel writer, the
*  incredible travel writer who transitioned fairly late in life, or I think in middle age.
*  And this is a beautiful memoir of that period of her life. And Judith Butler is coming out with a
*  book called Who's Afraid of Gender. Stephanie McLaughlin
*  Turns out a lot of people are afraid of gender. Well, thank you, Masha.
*  Peter Pichai Oh, this was really fun.
