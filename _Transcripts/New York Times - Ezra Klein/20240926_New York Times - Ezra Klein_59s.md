# Pete Buttigieg on How JD Vance Failed Springfield
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDPPzIrpWCI)
*  It is true that Springfield is growing. It is true that their economy is growing. It is true [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDPPzIrpWCI&t=0.0s)]
*  that their population is growing. It is also true that with thousands of new arrivals there, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDPPzIrpWCI&t=4.08s)]
*  not because they are immigrants, but because they are people, there are a lot of people [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDPPzIrpWCI&t=10.48s)]
*  going to the hospital and enrolling in schools that were not designed to take that big of a shift in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDPPzIrpWCI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  a single year or a couple of years. It was not true that disease is up or crime is up. So it's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDPPzIrpWCI&t=19.12s)]
*  complicated. But what you didn't hear from JD Vance is what I think an earnest politician would [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDPPzIrpWCI&t=25.12s)]
*  do, which is say, some of my constituents had this problem, so I went and got them help. This [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDPPzIrpWCI&t=31.28s)]
*  all originated supposedly with them saying we need more federal help. He's their United States [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDPPzIrpWCI&t=36.4s)]
*  Senator. It's literally his job to mobilize federal help for his constituents. I haven't [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDPPzIrpWCI&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  heard a peep out of him about anything he's doing to solve the problem because, of course, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDPPzIrpWCI&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  his purpose is not to solve the problem, is to use the problem. That's a pattern we see again [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDPPzIrpWCI&t=48.0s)]
*  and again and again in how Trump fans deal with any issue from immigration to any of the others. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDPPzIrpWCI&t=54.16s)]
