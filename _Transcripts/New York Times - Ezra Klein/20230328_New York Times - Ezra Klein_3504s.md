# Trump’s Legal Jeopardy and America’s Political Crossroads
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [March 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8XX40MccCU)
*  I'm Ezra Klein.
*  This is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  All right.
*  Before we start today, we are taking questions for the upcoming Ask Me Anything episode.
*  If you've got anything, anything at all to ask me that you want to hear answered on the show,
*  send it in to ezrakleinshow at nytimes.com. We are accepting questions until Sunday, April 2nd.
*  Anything that comes in after that, we're not going to consider. We just get a lot and we've got to
*  start sorting through it. Send it in before Sunday, April 2nd if you want it to be part of the show.
*  Speaking of dates, I'm recording this on Monday, March 27th. It's a Monday with a lot of uncertainty.
*  We don't yet know what is going to happen with the case against Donald Trump in Manhattan,
*  the case around the Stormy Daniels hush money payments. It is possible Donald Trump could be
*  charged with a felony, with a misdemeanor, with nothing. It's also not the only case against
*  Donald Trump. There's a case in Georgia that is around election subversion. There are different
*  investigations opened by the Department of Justice, again around January 6th and the election,
*  and then also around classified documents. There's quite a lot of legal risk around
*  Donald Trump right now. Where there's legal risk, there's political risk, there's risk of violence,
*  the risk of damage to our institutions, either because they do hold Donald Trump accountable
*  or because they don't. Donald Trump forces the political system constantly into profoundly
*  challenging positions that don't really have good answers, that really, really don't have good
*  answers. That is part of the danger he poses, but also part of the danger. We talk about this today
*  that his movement poses, that the kind of politics that he doesn't just practice,
*  but that he is rewarded for, that is wanted so badly by the people who support him that others
*  in the Republican Party now ape it. That is also, maybe that is centrally where the risk comes from.
*  And so the question at the moment is how to balance all these different kinds of risks and
*  questions and cases. And my colleague, David French, a New York Times opinion, has been
*  thinking quite a bit about how to do just that. David is a lawyer. He's done a lot of cases in
*  free speech and religious rights areas. He is a longtime conservative commentator, and he has been
*  trying to parse the legal merits of the cases against Donald Trump, the political questions
*  around them, and the ways institutions should or should not think about moving forward.
*  And also, as you'll hear, the ways the Republican Party has collapsed as a safeguard of these
*  institutions and as a force that enables them to make the decisions they need to make.
*  So we talk about all that here. As always, my email is zercleinshow.nytimes.com.
*  David French, now of the New York Times, the first time we've done this since then. Welcome to the
*  show. Well, thank you. It is the first time, isn't it? Yeah, it's an honor to be your colleague.
*  It's a whole new relationship. But it's a good time to have you here because we have a bunch of
*  Donald Trump legal questions. And so I wanted to start with this. From the outside, as a non-lawyer,
*  the Stormy Daniels case feels pretty clean. You have Michael Cohen. He paid off Stormy Daniels.
*  We know that. We know Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen. We know Cohen got prosecuted and actually
*  went to jail for that. And so, you know, I'm a simple child. It seems like Trump should too.
*  So why do you and many others consider the case weak and in some ways unusual?
*  Yeah, it's complicated. And it's complicated because of where the different cases have been.
*  Okay. So you're correct that the Stormy Daniels hush money piece of this is really pretty clean.
*  You had Michael Cohen pays Stormy Daniels $130,000. He has reimbursed for that, plus some
*  additional money on top of that. And it's all mischaracterized. This is not classified in the
*  business records as hush money for porn star. This is all mischaracterized. And that's pretty
*  neat and clean falsification of business records. Okay. Problem. One is not really a problem. It's
*  a misdemeanor. So it's not a big crime, but certainly you shouldn't give Trump any favors
*  and refuse to indict him for misdemeanor when you would indict anybody else. I'm a big believer that
*  a president is not nobility. They're just a citizen like you and I. And if citizen Trump would be
*  indicted for this, then former president Trump should be indicted for this. But there's a two
*  year statute of limitations. So it's a misdemeanor with a two year statute of limitations, arguably,
*  and we can get into this, arguably that has expired. So how do you continue to make the
*  Stormy Daniels case an issue? Well, New York law says that if you commit this misdemeanor of
*  falsification of records in furtherance of another crime, then it's a felony and it's got a five year
*  statute of limitations. So then the question is, what is the other crime this hush money payment
*  was in furtherance of? Now, to be super clear, as of the time of the taping of this podcast,
*  we haven't seen an indictment. So everything that's going to follow here is what I would call
*  informed speculation. The prosecutor could surprise us, but the informed speculation is that the other
*  crime is a federal campaign finance law violation. The very violation that Michael Cohen pleaded
*  guilty to and that landed him in federal prison, which was an unlawful campaign contribution and
*  Trump directing an unlawful campaign contribution. So you might be saying, well, wait a minute,
*  David, why is this any kind of a stretch? Because Michael Cohen pled guilty to this and
*  he went to jail for it. Well, the problem is what we're talking about is prosecuting a federal,
*  tying a state misdemeanor to a federal felony that was never prosecuted by the feds.
*  So neither the Trump DOJ nor the Biden DOJ brought this prosecution. We could talk about why that
*  might be. We don't know for sure, but I can tell you there was a tremendous amount of controversy
*  in the legal world around the Michael Cohen guilty plea because the question was, did he actually
*  plead guilty to something that was really and truly a crime? There's a lot of argument over
*  the Stormy Daniels hush money payment, how it interrelates with federal election law,
*  and whether or not that was actually an illegal campaign contribution or just the same kind of
*  money that somebody would spend who's a billionaire or a hundred millionaire or whatever he is,
*  that somebody would spend when they're trying to conceal negative information from their family.
*  And so there was a big argument over whether this was a federal crime to begin with.
*  John Edwards had been prosecuted for something remarkably similar, but the prosecution failed
*  with a hung jury. The case was not retried. So it's a local district attorney prosecuting a
*  state level misdemeanor, potentially tying that to a federal felony that was never prosecuted by the
*  federal government. So that's why a lot of folks look at this and me included and say,
*  that's a bit of a reach. So you mentioned in your columns when thinking about this,
*  that there are sort of two opposing forces for you. One is if you committed a crime,
*  you should pay for the crime. And the other is a legal principle called lenity. Can you explain
*  what lenity is? Yeah. So the rule of lenity, and this is something that's actually been talked
*  about pretty recently at the Supreme court is essentially a rule that says, wait a minute,
*  if there is ambiguity in a statute, if the meaning is hazy and we're talking about a criminal
*  prosecution, then when the meaning is hazy, when there's ambiguity and interpretation,
*  then you shouldn't bring the case that when a person's liberty is at stake as it is in a
*  criminal prosecution, you should prosecute people when statutes are clear and legal obligations are
*  clear. When statutes are not clear, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the defendant.
*  And then there's also the equitable principle on the other side that says, hey, equal justice. And
*  there was a good piece in the Times before I wrote my piece saying, hey, it's really unjust to
*  throw someone in jail for committing a crime at the direction of another person. That's Cohen
*  and the payoff scheme was Stormy Daniels and not prosecute the person who directed the scheme.
*  That seems strange and I completely agree, but that goes to the question of why didn't the
*  federal government pursue those charges? Well, one suspicion many people have gets at this
*  other category of risk, which is not that the jury wouldn't agree with the prosecutor,
*  but that political risk is real. And you'll hear the argument basically that it would be politically
*  combustible to prosecute Donald Trump for crimes. He himself has said there'll be violence
*  and prosecutors do exercise discretion on what cases they do and don't bring. That happens
*  routinely. The idea that everybody gets prosecuted for every law they break is not accurate. And so
*  even if Trump did commit the crime here, it's just not in the national interest to prosecute.
*  And that's not a crazy thing for prosecutors to weigh. And maybe that is what the, we don't know,
*  but maybe that is what the DOJ at least under Biden decided. How do you think about the arguments for
*  weighing political risk? Yeah, that's a very good question. And I'm kind of a hardliner on this,
*  Ezra. My view is it is not the role of the prosecutor to weigh the political risk.
*  So the prosecutor might be weighing such things as what is my law enforcement priority to bring
*  peace to the streets? So for example, a classic exercise of prosecutorial discretion is our
*  emphasis this year is going to be on prosecuting gun crimes. But that's a classic sort of strategic
*  law enforcement decision made in often in communication with political leaders about
*  allocating limited law enforcement resources. What is not typical for a prosecutor and what I would
*  say we do not want prosecutors doing is saying, if I prosecute this case, it creates a massive
*  political problem. Or if I prosecute this case, it could lead to unrest in the streets, which gives
*  sort of a mob the veto power over the rule of law. In actuality, the federal constitution
*  and most state constitutions, not all of them, but most, they do provide for a political process
*  on prosecutions. And that's the pardon power or clemency. And so the head of the executive branch,
*  and this is a holdover from, you know, colonial times and our royal British heritage, that one of
*  the last vestiges of royalty is this sort of absolute pardon power that exists with the president.
*  And so the way this should work, in my view, Ezra, is the prosecutor brings cases based on the facts
*  and the law and the prosecutorial priorities of the office. The political branch through the president
*  and its pardon power, a governor with pardons and clemency, the president can trump that
*  for political reasons, but that's not the prosecutor's job. And the classic example of
*  this is, of course, the grand jury that was moving towards indicting Richard Nixon,
*  and Gerald Ford stepped in and pardoned Nixon. Extremely controversial that he did that.
*  And I think that in hindsight, there's maybe a lot of more reasons why it's a mistake than proper,
*  but that's the way the system is supposed to work. The justice system was moving in one direction,
*  and then the president intervened using his constitutional authority to make that political
*  determination. I want to pick up that question of hindsight. My view is that Gerald Ford's decision
*  to pardon Nixon, it created the belief in our political system, I'd maybe even say the precedent
*  that we shouldn't prosecute former presidents even when they have committed crimes because it
*  would be too hard on the country. The famous, our long national nightmare is over. Do you think that
*  pardon was wrong in the sense that it damaged our political and legal culture, that it created the
*  expectation that presidents are indeed above the law? That's a really good question. And I'm going
*  to admit that I'm torn. And I used not to be torn. And the reason why I wasn't torn is I thought that
*  the fallout from Watergate, where you did have both congressional elections, presidential election,
*  where there was a public rebuke of the corruption that existed in the Republican Party at that time,
*  a number of post Watergate reforms, it seemed as if the political system worked in a way to rebuke
*  a corrupt president to create reforms to minimize the chances of future corruption.
*  But what we have seen since Watergate has caused me to doubt those conclusions that I reached earlier
*  in my adult life, because it is absolutely the case that the combination of increasing polarization
*  and failures of two separate, in my view, completely merited impeachments during the Trump era
*  has demonstrated that the system, the political system for holding presidents accountable for
*  misconduct has broken. It is just broken. And so then you're left with the legal system,
*  which holds everyone, can hold everyone else in America accountable. And in fact, if you look at
*  American history, we've prosecuted a former vice president, we've prosecuted federal judges, we've
*  prosecuted members of Congress, we've prosecuted governors of states. And the system is held,
*  it's been healthy for our system. There's no reason to believe that we can't prosecute a former
*  president. And it's interesting, because I don't want to say we're an outlier, but you certainly
*  see comparative examples internationally that work the opposite way. I was struck when JD Vance and
*  some other Republicans have been saying that it would be a third world country dissent for us to
*  prosecute a former president, but it just happened in Israel, which obviously is now undergoing a
*  lot of tumult around that. It happens in South Korea. It happens in France. Nicholas Sarkozy
*  has been actually sentenced to prison, although he's appealing that right now.
*  How do you understand the international precedent here? We actually do have a lot of examples where
*  national leaders get prosecuted, in some cases even sent to prison, and systems
*  continue on, sometimes even get reelected later, which is always striking to me. But how do you
*  think about that international dimension? The argument using the international example
*  is to use a legal term, presuming facts, not an evidence. So in other words, what they're presuming
*  when they're making this argument that the idea that a former president can be prosecuted,
*  specifically Donald Trump, what they're presuming is that the system is broken and that the evidence
*  that it is broken is the prosecution of a former president. And they're getting that completely
*  wrong. There are certainly broken legal systems where political losers are prosecuted routinely.
*  We've seen this in authoritarian countries, but the evidence that the American legal system is
*  so fundamentally broken is missing. In fact, of the three branches that have been through the Trump
*  years, I would argue that the judicial branch in many ways weathered it the best, in part because
*  it was the judicial branch, both Democratic and Republican nominated judges and justices,
*  who blocked the election steal effort at every turn. Now I understand that there might be many
*  listeners who will point to this or that decision by more conservative courts and say, that's bad
*  and wrong. But if you're talking about the preservation of the system itself, the judiciary
*  shined during the 2020 election challenges. And there's no indication right now that the judiciary
*  is not up to the task of resolving a criminal complaint against a former president.
*  So one thing I've heard just in my own life from people is a sense that Donald Trump was responsible
*  for misdeeds that were so grave that even to people who quite dislike him, the idea that you're
*  going to get him on this Stormy Daniels hush money thing feels off to them. And I'm not claiming that
*  as a legal point. But one thing it brings up is that there are other cases pending against Trump.
*  There are actually a lot of them. The organization Just Security counts 23 separate civil and criminal
*  lawsuits against him. And the one I think getting the most attention from a lot of legal scholars,
*  I trust that people seem to think is the strongest that I believe you think is the strongest
*  and is most related to the misty that was most grave is in Georgia. So tell me a bit about that
*  case. Yeah, I am of the belief that the Georgia case is the strongest case based on what we know
*  publicly. So let's just caveat that based on what we know publicly, it's the strongest case.
*  And the reason why it's strong is because the marriage between the law and the facts is so
*  tight. So Georgia, for example, and I'm not pretending that this is the only sort of evidence
*  that's applicable. But Georgia, for example, prohibits criminal solicitation to commit election
*  fraud. In other words, just the effort to try to induce someone to commit election fraud
*  is criminalized in Georgia. And it's a quite clear statute. There's not much that's ambiguous
*  about it at all. So what's the evidence? Now, if you remember, there was a recorded phone call
*  between Donald Trump and the Georgia Secretary of State's office. And the key part of that call,
*  he asks them to find the Georgia Secretary of State's office about 11,780 votes, roughly 12,000
*  votes to overcome the deficit in Georgia. He then talks about how there is legal risk
*  to the Georgia Secretary of State if he doesn't do this, that there could be law enforcement
*  action undertaken against the Georgia Secretary of State if he doesn't find the votes. There's
*  nothing subtle about it. That's your inducement there. That's what separates this from, hey,
*  I've been reading something that says that a lot of dead people voted. What do you think?
*  Is that true? That's an inquiry versus I need 12,000 votes or you might find yourself prosecuted.
*  That's something else entirely. And let's put it this way. Let's say if it's a local sheriff
*  and they are subject to an election and they're losing the election by 80 votes
*  and they go to the county election commissioner and says, I need 90 votes or you might find
*  yourself in handcuffs. That local sheriff would already be arrested and tried for this.
*  It would not be considered a controversial case at all. Right? Here we have a former president and his
*  language is only slightly less direct than what I just said. It's very slightly less direct, but
*  clearly not just implicating criminality, but expressly stating that it's possible.
*  Boy, that's that those facts alone. And I haven't even mentioned the fact that there was a fake
*  electors scheme in Georgia where people were presuming to be the true Trump electors.
*  There are Georgia anti-conspiracy statutes regarding election fraud that are applicable.
*  It is not hard to explain this to the American people. You criminalize solicitation election
*  fraud. Trump asked for to find almost 12,000 votes and said there could be criminal jeopardy
*  for the secretary of state. If he didn't, that is a very straight line kind of prosecution.
*  Where is that case in process? So that's a great question. Georgia convened a special grand jury
*  to look at all of this. Now, under Georgia law, that special grand jury didn't have the power to
*  indict in the way that other grand juries have the ability to hand up indictments.
*  So they did not have the power to indict. So it issued a report recommending certain indictments.
*  A very small portion of that report was released to the public, I believe in February. And there
*  was an indication that indictments would be imminent. They would be soon. So quite literally,
*  at any moment, we could see Fonny Willis, the Fulton County prosecutor, potentially
*  issue an announcement of indictments based on this special grand jury report.
*  Does a case like that turn in any way on whether or not you can prove
*  Donald Trump knew the theories he was peddling were false?
*  I think it's new or should have known. In other words, did he have a legitimate reason to believe
*  that what he was peddling was true? That's where you saw the January 6th commission really digging
*  into. Now, this is crossing of the streams or jumping to another stream where the January 6th
*  commission did a really good job of sort of explaining how many people told the president
*  he didn't have a case to overturn the election. A lot of that is the kind of foundation you would
*  lay in trial where you're saying, ladies and gentlemen, the jury, he may tell you that he
*  legit thought that 12,000 dead people had voted or whatever. He may tell you that all of the greatest
*  experts told him that the Georgia election was bogus and fraudulent, but let me explain to you
*  what he was actually told and what he actually knew. And that would be a part of the trial.
*  And that would be a part of the trial. Then there's another legal probe, which I want to
*  touch on before moving to some bigger picture questions that you mentioned and that others have,
*  which is Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed special counsel Jack Smith to look into Trump's
*  role in January 6th, possibly other things. Tell me a bit about that investigation. There's been
*  talk about Mike Pence testifying or they want him to like this one also seems like it has some
*  politically explosive potential. Yeah. And both of the, and the two strands of the special counsel
*  investigation, one is investigating not just January 6th, but critically the effort to reverse
*  the election in general and the classified documents scandal from Mar-a-Lago. These are
*  two separate things. The January 6th related and election steel related investigation is a federal
*  investigation looking at potential federal crimes. Now, the reason why I said the Georgia
*  investigation is so straightforward is that the evidence in Georgia is just easy to lay out and
*  easy to expose. That's not to say that there isn't a lot of evidence of criminality at the
*  federal level. There is, and the January 6th commission made a criminal referral, which is
*  not as big a deal as sort of it was hyped by many folks in the media. A criminal referral doesn't
*  require the justice department to prosecute anybody, but the criminal referral by the January
*  6th commission did give you a sense of the kinds of claims that could be brought against Trump.
*  So obstruction of an official proceeding, which criminalizes anyone who corruptly obstructs,
*  influence or impedes any official proceeding or attempts to do so. You have conspiracy to defraud
*  the United States. The one that I have thought is very intriguing is the 18 USC section 2383,
*  which criminalizes inciting, assisting or engaging in any rebellion or insurrection
*  against the authority of the United States. In my view, Ezra, that is most clearly what happened
*  around January 6th. The really big issue around a prosecution for that is it is very difficult to
*  prove incitement constitutionally. That's a tough hurdle to clear because we strongly protect free
*  speech rights. We protect even people who urge the overthrow of the government. That's protected
*  free speech as long as you're not inciting imminent lawless action. And so the question is,
*  did he incite what occurred on January 6th? And sort of the common sense view of it is, well,
*  heck yes, he did. But there's a legal definition of incitement that's pretty strict.
*  So I want to zoom out here to maybe a broader theory of the challenge Trump keeps posing to
*  systems. Because I think I've had versions of the conversation we're having here across a lot of
*  domains in a way that creates a pattern. And I think of what happens here as sort of the Trump's
*  disturbance dividend. What he does is he violently disturbs the workings of a system.
*  And it could be the media, or the presidency, or social media, or the law. He does it by violating
*  very established norms or rules or laws for behavior. And then the system to uphold its
*  own workings has to treat him as a kind of disturbance. It has to punish or censure or
*  contain him. His own staff has to encircle him, not tell him things, not carry out his orders.
*  And then he can complain about unfair treatment, or that the system is against him. He can get all
*  this attention from this huge conflict that he is unable to incite. And I'm not somebody who
*  believes he's Teflon or that this is exactly good for him. But it does keep him in this weird way
*  at the center of everything. I mean, we are talking more about Donald Trump right now than about Joe
*  Biden, than about Ron DeSantis. And it does damage to all these systems he touches, because it really
*  is at that point no good answer. Either the system has to turn against him, or the system is not
*  working properly, or it has to give him a free pass, in which case it has degraded itself further.
*  And it's this weird hard cases, or maybe bad people make bad laws problem. But it seems to
*  me Trump just keeps posing it to institution after institution and domain after domain.
*  Yes. And what we really see is how imperfect a vehicle the law is to correct a breakdown in
*  moral norms. So let's just look at the challenge created. And I keep going back to this when I
*  think about these times. The challenge created by the failure of, in particular, the second
*  impeachment effort. So this was not a legal proceeding in the classic sense that you think
*  of as legal proceedings. This was a political process designed by the founders to check the
*  power of a president. And if you were going to tell me as a kid that a president could incite
*  an attack, a violent attack on the Capitol based on a completely fraudulent theory of an election
*  fraud, where he was literally trying to overthrow the lawfully elected government of the United
*  States, and that wouldn't qualify for a conviction. He was impeached, not convicted.
*  I would think that we'd lost our way, that we just flat out lost our way. And so what has ended up
*  happening, I think, is that a number of people have failed to exercise or demonstrate the moral
*  fortitude to stop Donald Trump from breaching American norms. And now a lot of people are sort
*  of begging the legal system to do what they failed to do. And the legal system, it is a
*  necessary part of American democracy, but it is not a substitute for moral courage.
*  And the real failure that we have seen in the Trump presidency, going from when he came down
*  the escalator, was a large scale failure of moral courage, time and time and time again,
*  to the point now where as I talk to Republicans who are still, they will go out and say that they
*  don't like this prosecution of Trump, and they're secretly hoping it happens and it succeeds.
*  That's a textbook failure of moral courage. And one of my real concerns here is if he is
*  indicted and convicted and sentenced, and that ends the matter, that people will say,
*  well, see, the system worked. And I would say it barely worked. It barely worked. The last remaining
*  guardrail held. The basic baseline rule of law, every other guardrail was stampeded over. But
*  that's another reason why I strongly object to political considerations of saying it's too
*  destabilizing, it's too disruptive to prosecute him, because then you would trample over that
*  last guardrail. You would say that the anger of the mob in the final analysis is going to trump
*  the rule of law. My own view, at the risk of sounding ridiculously nerdy, is to echo the words
*  of Theoden in The Two Towers in the Peter Jackson adaptation when he saw Saruman's army.
*  I didn't see this coming.
*  You did not, yes. He sees Saruman's army coming and he says, let them come. In other words,
*  defy the mob. Defy them. Do not let the mob win, period. That's why I get really nervous when I
*  keep hearing people saying we need a political consideration about whether or not to prosecute
*  crimes that prosecutors would otherwise prosecute under the belief they could prevail in court.
*  This is a place where I think it's important actually to be specific. I mean,
*  there was a failure of moral courage and it was on the part of the elected Republican Party.
*  Yes.
*  It was particularly on the part of Republicans in Congress. I think two things follow from this.
*  One is that most of the institutions, and this is a breakdown in the design of the founders,
*  they did not expect us to have highly polarized political parties operating across institutions.
*  They thought we would have a competition between the Senate and the House and the presidency and
*  the judiciary and ambition would check ambition. That there would be cooperation across branches
*  by political parties breaks the system in a much more profound way than I think people realize.
*  The Richard Nixon removal, or he ultimately resigns, but he would have been removed,
*  comes at this very low ebb of partisan polarization, this aberrant moment in American
*  party history, but we've not had that kind of situation for quite a long time.
*  I think this is a place where things are quite scary actually. I mean, as you say,
*  maybe the legal system holds, but I've often heard people say that the system held under Trump,
*  that ultimately he couldn't overturn an election. That's a very low bar because I think what we've
*  mainly seen is that if one of the two political parties is not willing to protect the system
*  over its own standard bearer, then the system doesn't hold. The last point I'll make on this,
*  one reason the way impeachment is treated frustrates me is that impeachment, the way the
*  power ended up being designed, given the vice presidency, is that impeachment really isn't a
*  partisan remedy. You get to keep your co-partisan in power. Mike Pence would have become president.
*  It's not like Nancy Pelosi would have become president. Even within that, the Republican
*  Party wasn't willing to act. Now you have the Republican Party saying they're going to drag
*  the prosecutors before Congress to testify. I think this is a much more profound breakdown
*  because it's not really about Donald Trump. If Donald Trump didn't have the Republican Party
*  behind him, he could not survive politically. It is only the Republican Party's support of him that
*  has allowed this to all become so dangerous. I'm going to go deeper than that because I think
*  ultimately one of the things we learned in 2016 is that the Republican elites didn't actually
*  command the Republican legions. So in 2016, we did have a number of Republican elites call out
*  Donald Trump in no uncertain terms, including some of the people who vigorously defend him now.
*  And they called out Trump, a Lindsey Graham, a Marco Rubio. I mean, you could go down the list.
*  The last two Republican nominees for president, John McCain and Mitt Romney, called out Donald
*  Trump. And they looked around for support and didn't see it. The people weren't with them.
*  You even saw it in the sort of conservative infotainment world. Fox was not all about
*  Donald Trump early on. Many of the talk radio hosts were not all about Donald Trump.
*  But the thing about Trump is he understood their audience in many ways better than they understood
*  their audience. And what ultimately ended up happening is that the Republican elites fell in
*  line behind this Republican populist uprising. And I am of the belief that moral courage could
*  have overcome that. Just take, for example, the second impeachment. If just a few more Republican
*  senators had had the guts to do what their job actually required and convict him and bar him from
*  future office, Donald Trump is not a factor right now. But that fear of the base that set in
*  at every level of the Republican elite is really something to see. It is something to behold. And
*  I would even include that evangelical elites. Evangelical elites were not for Donald Trump.
*  Early on, it was Jerry Falwell Jr. and a couple of other people more on the fringes than him,
*  and no one else. But when they saw where the people in the pews were, they got in line. And
*  I'm very nervous that if we think we can sort of change the elite focus, that we can change the
*  course of American politics, I think the rod is a little deeper than that, sadly. And that we have
*  a real problem with, I'm going to steal an analysis from my friend Yuval Levin. There's
*  always been a George Wallace constituency in American politics, sort of a George Wallace culture
*  in American politics. And for a long time, that constituency was, some of it was in the Democratic
*  party, some of it was in the Republican party. Now, all of it is in the Republican party. And so it
*  exercises this incredibly disproportionate influence over one of our two great political
*  parties to the point where you can rationally think as a Republican primary candidate,
*  that all I have to do is win over the reactionary populists, I can win a primary, and then turn
*  around to the rest of the Republican public and say, it's me or the Democrat, what are you going
*  to choose? And to add something to the way Yuval puts that, it's both that this tendency in
*  American politics has concentrated in the Republican party, but now they also have the media.
*  And so we talk about the party, but the party is very weak. And there is this endless debate,
*  I think, about whether or not right-wing media leads the base or the base leads right-wing media.
*  And I think you can't look at that as one way. I think these things have a ricochet or a dynamic
*  quality to them. But the dominion lawsuit has, I think, been a really interesting object lesson of
*  that many of us suspected, which is that whether or not Fox News makes this problem worse,
*  they do not themselves feel they have control over it. When confronted with the belief that
*  their viewers hold a view different than the one they hold, they will fold on that view,
*  and they will try to satisfy their viewers. Yes. So there's been an immense public service
*  done by the dominion lawsuit, even if the suit does not prevail. We could talk about the legal
*  barriers and the legal challenges and difficulties of suing a major media organization that's taking
*  on public topics and public entities like a major software voting company. But there's a tremendous
*  public service done because it lifted the lid on something that a lot of us had been running
*  around talking about for years, but we didn't have all the text messages. And that was, look,
*  these Republican leaders, these Republican, these conservative and right-wing hosts say one thing in
*  private and they say another thing in public. And everything you see them say on primetime,
*  you can also, they will be saying the opposite to friends, even just acquaintances. They'll be
*  saying the opposite behind closed doors. And I've been saying this for years. I have colleagues who
*  have been saying this for years. And then finally you had the documentary proof and the documentary
*  evidence. And here's the way they justify it, Ezra. It's a really interesting way in which they
*  rationalize it. And they essentially go something like this. Look, the mainstream media disrespects
*  our audience. The reason why they're our audience is they're disrespected by the mainstream media.
*  They're looked down on. They're called deplorables. I mean, you name it. We have our business because
*  we respect our audience when they don't. So we need to continue to respect our audience by giving
*  voice to their concerns. That's how this is rationalized, which is a weird form of respect
*  when you're sort of saying, I'm going to respect you by essentially coddling you by saying that
*  you're not ready for the truth. The truth hurts you too much. So I'm just not going to tell it to you.
*  That's a weird form of respect. That's not a form of respect I'm familiar with, but this is everywhere.
*  And I wrote a piece yesterday after the Trump rally Saturday night. There was a perfect vignette
*  example about how this works. And it was started with Ted Nugent, who was warming up the crowd.
*  And he called Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, a homosexual weirdo. That's what
*  he called him in the rally. Which is A, false. B, Zelensky's sexual orientation is irrelevant
*  to the rightness of Ukraine's cause, right? So it's weird. It's out of nowhere. It's false. It's
*  obviously a bigoted statement. And so what happens next is on this show, this network called Real
*  America's Voice, it's immediately the commentator says, that was amazing. And he says what a lot of
*  people are feeling. Well, that is exactly in a nutshell how this works. On right-wing media,
*  if your people are feeling something, they want to have that feeling reflected back to them.
*  Or they're going to be very angry. They're going to feel betrayed and they're going to go somewhere
*  else. So the way this worked at Fox, pre-election, what did they want to hear? What they were wanting
*  to hear was there's something wrong with this election, right? There's something wrong. The
*  mail-in ballots make this an inherently suspect election. Why did the early Arizona call cause
*  such a rupture with the audience? Well, how can you call Arizona when you've been telling us that
*  this election is problematic? That's contradictory. And so then Fox went right back to its old ways
*  after the election call to, again, satisfy the audience.
*  I am struck by the way this has become a value on the right. Because one way you could say the Fox
*  News thing is Fox News is a business run by a very rich man. And they're not respecting their
*  audience. They are serving their market. And however they dress it up, it's ridiculous.
*  They are business. They want to make as much money as possible and they will do whatever
*  is required to do that. Fine. That's capitalism. You don't have to laud anybody for it, but we've
*  seen it before. But you tell an interesting story about talking with Baptist ministers
*  about a former Baptist statement and being told that their flock would find that too elitist.
*  Yes. Could you tell that story?
*  Yeah. So this was early in the Trump presidency. I was invited and I spoke to a gathering of
*  Baptist pastors, many of them with pastors of big churches, some of small churches.
*  And we were talking about the importance of character in politicians. And the reason for
*  this was obvious. I mean, we had just seen the data that evangelicals had gone from in 2011,
*  the religious group in America most likely to say that immoral acts would disqualify a politician
*  to the group surveyed that was now least likely to say that. And what was particularly ironic is
*  that in 1998, the Southern Baptist Convention, which is quite conservative, issued a statement
*  on moral character of public officials. This is the height of the Bill Clinton Monica Lewinsky
*  scandal. And it said words, tolerance of serious wrong by leaders sears the conscience of a culture
*  leads to unrestrained lawlessness and surely will result in God's judgment. And this was
*  something passed overwhelmingly in the Southern Baptist Convention in 1998. And so I'm talking
*  to these Baptist pastors and I said, if that was true in 1998, isn't it true in 2017 or 2018?
*  And again, I'm talking about a Baptist moral resolution and a pastor raises his hand and I
*  said, yes. And he said, if I bring that up to my congregation, they're going to call it elitist.
*  And he was a pastor, I believe of congregation in Alabama. And it was an interesting demonstration
*  to me as to how thoroughly the sort of Trump movement and the populist movement had taught
*  and how thoroughly the members of this populist movement had imbibed this potion that said
*  criticism of our populist leader is elitism. Criticism equals elitism. And so in many ways,
*  people became inoculated against the truth. Even a Baptist statement was elitist in a Baptist
*  gathering if it took on Donald Trump. And that was quite striking to me. I've got story after
*  story after story of the Trump years living in a very, very red, heavily evangelical area
*  like that, where you couldn't even get to the truth because the firewall against hearing it
*  had been lifted so high. People might have heard of the John Hyde, Greg Lukanoff book,
*  The Coddling of the American Mind a few years back. And you had a nice line working off of that
*  where you called this the coddling the populist mind. I remember a great piece years ago now
*  calling this populist correctness, which I always thought was a quite good way of putting it.
*  On one level, it seems almost obvious to say that the challenge in American politics is not Donald
*  Trump. It is the voters who would support him. Absent them, Trump has no power. And I would also
*  say it is almost verboten in American politics to say that. But if I headline this podcast,
*  the problem isn't Trump, it's his voters. That is a much more explosive statement
*  than if I just say the problem, you know, American politics has a Donald Trump problem.
*  And it is interesting. We have for all that democracy in a way is meant to call forward
*  the deliberation and political and civic responsibility of the citizens. I think we
*  have lost the language of being willing to say some decisions and being willing to support some
*  things is bad. And it isn't just something that needs to be understood. It is also something that
*  can be criticized or even condemned. Well, you know, there's sort of if you're a politician,
*  the people can't fail, they can only be failed. So you're constantly presenting to the people
*  whom you're trying, you're trying to appeal to them to gain their votes. It's generally bad tactic
*  to say you guys messed up. It's much easier to say, well, it's not your fault that the previous
*  guy was a bad president. That's a lot easier to say. But for people in our job who don't have to
*  worry about winning over voters, I think it's really important to say when the people are
*  getting this really wrong. And I'm much more willing to say that now than I was in October 2016, say,
*  now that we've had years of watching Donald Trump be a president and be an ex president.
*  And then also when the especially when I'm talking to my Republican friends, there isn't the binary
*  choice argument anymore. They don't have the argument of what's Donald Trump or Joe Biden.
*  And if you're pro-life, you only have one choice or what all of the binary choice kind of arguments
*  that go along with the general election. You know, Trump has primary contenders now. And
*  the other thing to show there is something where Republican voters have adopted or spawned
*  or some combination of adopted and spawned this culture of cruelty is Trump's primary competitor,
*  Ron DeSantis, in many ways has become a primary Trump competitor by becoming a Trump mini-me.
*  Now, to be clear, I do not believe that Ron DeSantis is as dangerous as Donald Trump. I could
*  not see Ron DeSantis inspiring an attack on the Capitol, for example. But in many ways,
*  Ron DeSantis emerged from the pack by becoming the closest thing that a lot of Republicans saw to
*  another Donald Trump, but without Donald Trump's weaknesses. And that tells you that you've got a
*  real voter issue here. This is the law of supply and demand working. And one thing that is one of
*  the most sobering charts I've seen in recent years is right after January 6th, Republican approval
*  for Mike Pence plunged and for Mitch McConnell plunged. And Republican approval for Trump stayed
*  relatively high with just sort of a slight decrease. And this was after Mike Pence,
*  just consider, Ezra, if Mike Pence had said yes, what kind of constitutional crisis we'd face with
*  a mob braying for his head, he defended the constitutional order and became less popular
*  with Republicans. And so that's going to tell me that the problem that we have in this country is
*  not concentrated in a cowardly Republican elite. One of the reasons why the Republican elite is
*  cowardly is because the vitriol of the Republican base. I remember early on in the Trump years,
*  there was a vogue for looking at electoral system design reforms that people thought could answer
*  this challenge. That maybe you could look and find the problem in we weren't enough of a
*  multi-party democracy or we didn't use instant ranked voting or instant runoff voting or
*  ranked choice voting or whatever it might be. And I remember finally a political scientist said to me
*  that there is no answer in election design for the problem of a bad party or a bad person.
*  Right.
*  That you can do things that make your system better or worse. But once you have like one of
*  the nominees of the major parties operating in a very, very aberrant way with wide support from his
*  party, you can't solve that through trying to tweak the rules. I mean, one, you can't change
*  the rules already because that party would stand in your way. But even if you could,
*  you haven't actually solved the problem, which is, as you were saying, the demand for this kind of
*  political figure. And I think DeSantis gets at this point. One thing that I don't love the conversation
*  of DeSantis dangerous or not dangerous, because I don't really think I know. But one thing that I
*  noticed with him, the weakness of DeSantis is he doesn't have Trump's, to be blunt about it,
*  charm and charisma and humor. Liberals, I think, don't always like to admit this, but Trump is
*  funny. He is magnetic. He is a great showman. What DeSantis has is Trump's instinct for conflict with
*  systems, his sense that a way to break through in the attention marketplace is to go to war
*  with systems that don't really want to be at war with him, but to really attack reporters or to
*  really try to put himself out as the lone defender of the right against the institutions.
*  And there's just that dynamic as it becomes more mainstreamed in American politics. To go back to
*  this point about the disturbance dividend, systems don't have a good answer for a large
*  anti-system party. I mean, I just don't think that is a solvable problem.
*  I would agree with you, and especially it's contradictory in many ways to the emphasis
*  of the conservatism that I grew up with, which was very much about institution building and respect
*  for institutions, without a Pollyannaish view that says that institutions can't go bad or can't go
*  wrong. But the goal was institutional reform, not institutional destruction, or endless
*  institutional oppositionalism. And so part of what makes the United States of America,
*  the United States of America going all the way back to de Tocqueville, is the way in which we're
*  just relentless institution builders here in this country. We create civic associations of all kinds,
*  we create institutions of all kinds, and it's one of the better parts of American life, in my view.
*  And so if you become fundamentally anti-institutional, and then what you replace
*  it with isn't necessarily a set of new institutions, but a series of personalities
*  and political celebrities, then what you've done, you've done some real harm to the national fabric.
*  And I think that one of the things is somebody who, you know, I've been conservative for a
*  long time and have made my critiques of the media, the general critiques of the media for a long time,
*  and one of the things that's so distressing to me is I feel like the American right took legitimate
*  criticisms of the way in which the media universe traditionally in the United States had been
*  disproportionately left-leaning and therefore often unfair to conservative points of view,
*  and said, you know what, we're going to build an alternative media ecosystem. And they did,
*  and it's worse. It's worse. It's a celebrity-focused, populist, reactionary media
*  ecosystem. And I'm not going to say there aren't good journalists in right-leaning media. I know
*  a number of good journalists in right-leaning media, but it is a culture that is dominated by
*  the hot take. It is dominated by opposition and anger. And if you deviate from the hot take and
*  the opposition and anger, you are often gang tackled by these same angry voices as somehow
*  weak or cowardly. And these phrases, weak or cowardly, have particular potency on the right.
*  That is the ultimate sin. The ultimate sin on the right is to be seen as weak or not up for the
*  fight. And so that culture that's been created that is oppositional to its core as opposed to
*  constructive at its core creates real, there are real cultural and political
*  effects from that that are profoundly negative. So you can drive yourself crazy trying to think
*  about what the response of this or that system should be. I mean, I've always had a lot of
*  empathy for the people who ran social media networks in 2020 and had to figure out whether
*  or not to let a president or a recent ex-president or somebody who was going to be an ex-president
*  foment electoral subversion on their network or try to kick them off the network. I mean,
*  that was a very bad choice for anybody to have to face. There was no good option at that point.
*  But to go back to what you said earlier about prosecution, is your view that the systems
*  more or less shouldn't try to wrap themselves around the logic or the strategic answer,
*  that the view should be let them come and you try to do the job according to the norms and
*  and ethics of your institution as honestly and straightforwardly and almost naively
*  of the potential consequences as you can. I think you do your job and you do the best you
*  can to mitigate the consequences. And so that would mean, for example, if you're going to
*  indict Donald Trump, you're absolutely going to prepare law enforcement to deal with that. And
*  then at the same time, you're going to also relentlessly, repeatedly say to the public
*  why you're doing what you're doing, what the justification is, why you're treating
*  Donald Trump no better or no worse than any other American citizen in comparable circumstances,
*  that this is the even-handed application of justice. Not because you're necessarily going
*  to have sort of the whole populist movement have a, you know, for lack of better terms,
*  come to Jesus moment on this, but because what you're going to end up doing is you're going to be
*  consistently peeling people away. There was an interesting poll I saw recently where it talked
*  about, I believe it was Fox News viewers talking about a percentage, it might have been around 13%
*  or so, had had their minds actually impacted by the Dominion revelations, that this was something
*  that actually made an impact. 13% here and 5% there and pretty soon you're talking about
*  a movement that has become so weakened that it either has to be content with rump status or it
*  has to change. And I saw after 2022, really for the first time in the Trump era, a number of people
*  in my immediate environment who'd been consistently pro-Trump for a time after 2022 rethought it,
*  not because of 2022 in isolation, but because it changed the way they viewed 2022, 2020,
*  and 2018 and raised doubts that he's the winner that they thought he was.
*  That's a good place to wrap, I think. Always our final question, what are three books you
*  would recommend to the audience? So here's a good one that I read not long ago called
*  We the Fallen People, the Founders and the Future of American Democracy by a professor named Robert
*  Tracy McKenzie. It really looks at the role of sort of the view of the fallenness of human nature
*  in the design of the country. Really fascinating because one of the things I like about our
*  classical liberal legal structure is that it recognizes two realities about human beings.
*  One, we possess incalculable worth. We're all endowed with unalienable rights because we as
*  human beings possess incalculable worth. We also suffer from flaws. All of us suffer from flaws.
*  And classical liberalism is designed to protect our worth and to guard against our flaws. So that's
*  a really tremendous book. And the next two are just if you'd like to absolutely nerd out on
*  military history, which I basically do on a daily basis. And I'm two-thirds of the way through a
*  book called Napoleonic Wars, a Global History. And I'm going to really apologize to the author,
*  Alexander Mika Brides, wonderful book and really does demonstrate that maybe World War I wasn't
*  World War I. It was the Napoleonic Wars. And the other one, which is fascinating,
*  and it's a 2017 book by Alexander Watson called Ring of Steel, Germany and Austria-Hungary and
*  World War I. And it's written from sort of the central powers view of World War I. And it is
*  fascinating, absolutely fascinating getting into the mindset of Germany and Austria-Hungary. So
*  those are two history nerd books and one political philosophy nerd book.
*  David French, thank you very much. You nerd.
*  Thank you, Ezra. And I accept that as a compliment.
