# 'The Only Inoculant to a Corrupt Regime' | The Ezra Klein Show
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM)
*  Let me ask you something. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=0.0s)]
*  Sometimes I hear you say things and you seem really frustrated with, I think it's Democrats [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=2.16s)]
*  specifically, but I mean, is there a part of you that takes the other side of that argument [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=8.0s)]
*  that feels that Trump is trying to really fundamentally change the character of this [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=13.84s)]
*  country and its institutions and how it works and the people who are scared as shit and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=17.96s)]
*  like don't know what to do because they don't really have any power over it and they don't [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=23.0s)]
*  know how to get listened to, that there's a righteousness to the way they feel too? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=28.0s)]
*  Yeah, like people are valid in their anger and it is a fool's errand to try to talk somebody [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=35.32s)]
*  out of their feelings. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=43.36s)]
*  That is not, that's not a good idea. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=45.36s)]
*  You can affirm the validity of their feelings and also present a productive strategy for [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=50.28s)]
*  resolving some of those, the drivers of that anger or that fear. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=58.6s)]
*  You know, on your point about El Salvador, you know, my dad was the pastor of a Spanish [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=66.84s)]
*  language church growing up and you want to meet somebody that really fucking hates gangs [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  you talk to an immigrant who gave up a profound amount to leave a country that was corrupt [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=79.83999999999999s)]
*  and run by gangs. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=90.36s)]
*  That same person cares passionately about due process. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  They understand that the only inoculant against a corrupt regime is fidelity to due process. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=98.32s)]
*  And if we had had due process in these cases, we would be in a position to evaluate a judge's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=107.24s)]
*  decision about whether or not that person was involved in human trafficking or whatever [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  the claim is. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=119.88s)]
*  But the point is that we don't have it and it's a deep strategic mistake to accept that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=121.28s)]
*  we have to choose between really hating gangs and really loving due process. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=128.76s)]
*  When you have experienced like truly being afraid of being kidnapped or having your business [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=134.84s)]
*  exploited or human trafficking, like you take it quite seriously. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  That feeling is real and valid and the productive strategy is due process, fidelity to due process. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  If you're really believing that we are entering a totalitarian state is the point here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=154.88s)]
*  If you're really worried that we're never going to have elections again, why is the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=162.24s)]
*  second bullet point on your agenda primaring Democrats? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=166.16s)]
*  That's not what people do in real scenarios like that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J-6BUTk-TM&t=171.32000000000002s)]
