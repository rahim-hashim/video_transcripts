# Biden, Psychedelics, Twitter, My New Book â€” and So Much More
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [July 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIgWIYK1Wms)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  Welcome to the Ask Me Anything episode.
*  I'm here with my revered editor, the bringer of gravitas, Aaron Redica.
*  We've got tons of questions from the hundreds that you all sent in, which I'm always grateful
*  for, that I'm about to get peppered with.
*  Aaron, it's good to actually see you in person.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  We're live in New York.
*  This is not Saturday night, however.
*  Let's just get rolling.
*  There's so many questions.
*  Let's not waste time.
*  So you're going on book leave, and many of your listeners were curious what the book
*  is about.
*  I don't think this will surprise anybody listening to the show.
*  So I'm co-writing a book with Derek Thompson of The Atlantic, who if you don't read him,
*  he's great.
*  And it's a book about what I often call supply-side progressivism or liberalism that builds what
*  Derek calls abundance or the abundance agenda.
*  But at its core, where do we have problems where the fundamental problem is scarcity?
*  We don't have enough of something we need.
*  And when that problem is located, how do we fix it?
*  Sometimes the necessity here is for the government to create more of something we need, right?
*  To do clean energy tax credits or a warp speed for vaccines.
*  And sometimes the government is actually making it impossible or very difficult to create
*  the thing we need, say housing in California.
*  And so those are the sort of layers of the project.
*  And I think the other layer of it is how did liberalism and particularly places where liberals
*  govern become so bad at building?
*  How did the coalition that imagines itself as behind a strong and effective government
*  actually become often unable to run governments that are strong and effective?
*  And so some of the project is unearthing the secondary history of sort of post-20th century
*  liberalism, sort of the rise of the New Left, the rise of the Natarite and so on movements
*  that created a lot of ways in which liberals both want an activist government and then
*  want a lot of ways for people to stand in front of that government and say, stop, you're
*  not listening to my needs, you're going to hurt the environment, et cetera.
*  And the point is not that one of these sides is right and one of them is wrong, but you
*  have to understand the way they've collided in governance to understand a bunch of the
*  problems we have now and to maybe say, okay, the balance on this is off given what we're
*  facing.
*  So that's the project of the book.
*  I'm going to be off for about three months.
*  Hopefully I'll get the book done or finished in that time.
*  We'll see, but I'm excited about it.
*  I'm going to push into the content there in a second, but I wanted to ask you one question
*  about collaborating with Derek.
*  So you are a person who is at the center of the process, both for your show and your column.
*  How are you envisioning doing it, a book with someone?
*  I'm just very curious about that.
*  And there are a lot of process questions from your listeners, so I thought I'd ask that.
*  He's been on Bookly first due to his schedule and then I'm going on.
*  One of the reasons I wanted to co-write this book is I found writing my first book, Why
*  We're Polarized, to be an incredibly lonely experience.
*  Almost every creative project I've done in my life that I've really enjoyed has had somebody
*  else at the center of it with me.
*  In my column, it's you.
*  On the podcast, it's the team and particularly Roger, who's been with the show for so long,
*  Roger Karma, our senior editor.
*  When I launched Vox, I did that with Melissa Bell and Matthew Glacius.
*  When I did Why We're Polarized, it was really just me.
*  It's not that I didn't have an editor, Ben Lehnan, who's great, but for months it was
*  just me struggling with the page.
*  And a lot of my best thinking is done when I talk.
*  A lot of my best thinking is done in relationship to other people.
*  And I just think it makes me smarter to be working with other people.
*  And I think that it also helps me actually get things done.
*  And I just wanted it to be a less lonely process.
*  There's obviously advantages to doing projects on your own because you have full creative
*  control over them, but there are real disadvantages to it, too.
*  So this was an experiment that I wanted to at least attempt.
*  Yeah, we spend a lot of time on the phone.
*  It's like an old school communist editor relationship.
*  All right, let's dig into the actual material, though, because you and I have worked a lot
*  on this and there's been a ton on the show as well.
*  So Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, faced a sharp crisis very recently where a
*  section of the I-95 collapsed.
*  And Joel D. has written in asking us whether the fact that they were actually able to get
*  the section of I-95 that fell open 12 days after it collapsed, what the implications
*  are for a liberalism that builds in that sequence.
*  So I think this has been a really interesting model because Shapiro is bragging about it.
*  The Biden administration likes to tell me about the role they played in it.
*  And I think it's also important to say they did this with union labor.
*  It's actually been a big part of how they intended it and also how they've narrativized
*  it.
*  It wasn't just that they got this portion built, which was estimated to take months.
*  It's not at all unusual for a government project, infrastructure project, estimated to take
*  months to take years.
*  And instead it took days.
*  They were going around the clock.
*  They had a live stream on it.
*  But you have to take seriously what he did.
*  So the Pennsylvania governor has emergency powers during a disaster.
*  And Shapiro signed a proclamation that reads, quote, I hereby suspend the provisions of
*  any other regulatory statute prescribing the procedures for conduct of Commonwealth business
*  or the orders, rules or regulations of any Commonwealth agency.
*  If strict compliance with the provisions of any statute order, rules or regulations would
*  in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with this emergency event.
*  So I did a piece with you a couple months back called Everything Bagel Liberalism.
*  And the point of that is that liberals often put a huge number of secondary objectives
*  into a single project.
*  So they want to restore American dominance and semiconductor manufacturing.
*  But then there are also these rules in there for on-site childcare and how to break the
*  contracting into small tasks so you can have a more diverse set of subcontractors.
*  What sort of community investments you need to make in your climate action mitigation
*  plan and so on.
*  And one of the points of that piece was you can choose some.
*  Here they chose unions.
*  But you can't choose all of them.
*  And what they did here, what Shapiro was able to do in Pennsylvania was he wiped out functionally
*  everything else.
*  You could not sue and stop this project using, say, environmental litigation, which happens
*  on a lot of different projects.
*  They just went too fast and they wiped a lot of things out.
*  If you listen to the Jen Palka episode, all these different states and of course the federal
*  government have very complicated procurement and contracting rules meant to make sure things
*  are fair, that people who aren't chosen can challenge, all that was out the window.
*  So I think it's relevant what they did.
*  But it is also relevant that usually you cannot do this.
*  What they did was radically alter the process by which building happens.
*  And I'll make one other point about it that I think is a good way to think about it conceptually.
*  What Shapiro ultimately said here is that I, Josh Shapiro, who won election with a majority
*  of the vote from the voters in Pennsylvania, I should be trusted with acting in a way that
*  ensures the elector gets what it wants.
*  In his view, in that point, it was the quick rebuilding of I-95.
*  The processes we have are a way of saying, we think that the elected representatives
*  cannot be trusted on this.
*  And so we're going to hamstring them or tie them up with a lot of other processes meant
*  to allow more voice, meant to allow more opposition, meant to allow more litigation.
*  And you could think that's right or wrong.
*  But what's I think valuable about seeing what happened in Pennsylvania is that there's nothing
*  about government doing projects.
*  It means they can't be done fast.
*  There's nothing about unions doing projects.
*  It means they can't be done fast.
*  But you have to make some choices.
*  So you could just give more governors and give the president more emergency powers than
*  wipe out a lot of procurement rules.
*  But that would upset a lot of people.
*  And so what Pennsylvania shows is it is possible.
*  But what the invoking of these emergency powers also shows is it cannot be done under the
*  normal policies that the governors use.
*  And the obvious thrill that everybody involved in it now feels should make us wonder if we're
*  not missing something in our normal processes.
*  Emergency processes shouldn't make you feel so much happier than normal processes.
*  That's not normally how that goes.
*  But OK, virtually no one would say, well, we really would like to have I-95 be collapsed.
*  No one wants that.
*  Right.
*  So the emergency is going to override very happily the conditions that normally would
*  obtain.
*  Right.
*  But how are you going to transfer that kind of emergency process to an ordinary process
*  where people are going to have objections, some of which are going to be reasonable,
*  many of which are going to be unreasonable?
*  I mean, it's easy to say, OK, great, they did it in 12 days, but it was an emergency.
*  And so they acted like it was an emergency.
*  I think first there's a question of what in our minds should be an emergency.
*  Right.
*  I mean, my interest in this topic is driven more than anything else by decarbonization.
*  If you believe that climate is an emergency, and I do believe it's an emergency, you know,
*  it's an emergency playing out over years and decades, not days.
*  The summer seems to agree with you.
*  The summer seems to agree with me.
*  Then I think you need to, and this is the, you know, the big argument inside, I think,
*  whole area, then I think you need to begin saying our processes don't work for this kind
*  of emergency.
*  This is a point now I've made in podcasts and columns, but the largest solar farm in
*  America is something on the order of 585 megawatts.
*  We're going to need to build two 400 megawatts solar power facilities a week for 30 years
*  to hit a middle of the road renewables pathway.
*  We do not have the capacity to do that.
*  That should be understood as an emergency, not something we can approach with business
*  as normal.
*  This is a point, as you know, I'm making a column that will probably be up by the time
*  this show comes, but to not choose to change processes is to choose right now.
*  It is to choose to absorb the problems of climate change at a higher level.
*  Now, look, everything is about where you put the dial and you're not going to go to full,
*  you know, wipe out all the procurement rules and nor should you.
*  You're not going to go to full, you know, wipe out all the environmental litigation,
*  nor should you.
*  But there is space between here and there.
*  And if we want to do a bunch of things that I think we should want to do, then we're going
*  to have to move in that direction.
*  And if we don't want to do it, then we're just going to have to say, okay, you know,
*  we're okay with the housing markets looking like they do in superstar cities.
*  We're okay with missing our Paris Climate Accord targets by a lot, not by a little.
*  You know, we're okay with a lot of things that we could fix.
*  And we're okay with liberal government having the accurate reputation, at least in America,
*  that it cannot build the projects it promises to build, right?
*  You can't have high-speed rail in California.
*  You can't get the big dig done, you know, at the cost and time you said it would.
*  The Second Avenue subway is going to be a total cost disaster.
*  Maybe if you try to build a bunch of miles of bike lanes in San Francisco, it's going
*  to take you a decade.
*  That is also a choice to say that's okay.
*  And you know, we prefer the outcome of these processes because we think there's enough
*  voice and we think that preventing the bad projects is worth it.
*  You can also hopefully make things quicker for good projects and slower for bad ones.
*  I mean, it doesn't have to be a process.
*  It cannot make any distinctions between what you're building.
*  Okay, so that brings us to Joel's follow-up question.
*  Joel is the star at the beginning of the show here.
*  So is there a version of permitting reform that would actually be a win-win for environmental
*  justice, community input, and for building faster?
*  Or do you see the values as inherently zero-sum?
*  I think it depends a little bit on which values we're talking about.
*  Let's take environmental justice and building faster before we take on community input.
*  And there I think it's pretty straightforward.
*  People sometimes talk about this as a quote green pass.
*  I think we know which projects are meant to be environmentally more sustainable.
*  And I think those should have a streamlined way forward.
*  So there's a good paper that I mentioned in the podcast of Robinson Meyer called The
*  Green Dilemma.
*  And the law professors who wrote that paper, they talk about a number of examples within
*  government, a very famous one is base closing commissions that basically identifies questions
*  around military base closing.
*  And it has a streamlined, fast-tracked, up or down vote way of doing that.
*  And you can imagine a certain set of processes that would be fast-tracked into that.
*  So if you're working on decarbonization, for instance, you know, it's renewable energy,
*  not fossil fuel energy, maybe you have a quicker path through environmental review.
*  Now, there are a lot of things that aren't just environmental review here, so it does
*  depend on what you're talking about.
*  But we're seeing this begin to happen.
*  Affordable housing in California has been sped past a bunch of points in the process
*  that used to have to go through, whereas market rate housing doesn't always get that.
*  So you can make decisions about what it is you're trying to speed up.
*  Community input is just tough because I think a lot gets hidden in that term.
*  Which community having what kind of input?
*  There are times when the processes we have allow communities, you know, and particularly
*  affected communities to come to the table, for instance, or come into the process and
*  be heard in a way they wouldn't otherwise.
*  There are also a lot of ways in which these processes often create space for the status
*  take something over, you know, very famously, I think all over the country, wealthy homeowners
*  are very good at manipulating the planning process.
*  You can't build below market rate homes and you can't build many homes at all in very,
*  very desirable and very, very economically important areas.
*  So which community is getting input?
*  The community that lives there now, the community that would like to live there, the community
*  that has time to show up to all these meetings that most people don't even know are going
*  on.
*  There's a huge amount of power that is wielded in meetings around the regulatory process
*  for basically any major bill you can think of.
*  Most people never know those meetings happen, but every lobbyist knows when those meetings
*  happen and money interests spend a lot of money making sure their interests are heard
*  and their thinking is heard at these meetings.
*  So this is a very tough thing to get right.
*  But a critique that many in this area make, Jerusalem Dempsey at the Atlantic has, I think,
*  written great pieces on this.
*  And that I agree with is that there is a difference between input and representative input.
*  Processes get captured.
*  And so there is often a question of what level and layer you're having people get engaged
*  in.
*  The fact that there was a meeting and some people showed up does not mean that what got
*  heard at that meeting was the sentiment of the community.
*  Like I've sat in SF City Council meetings and one thing that came up was whether or not
*  a 5G tower was going to get built.
*  person after person after person after person there attacked the 5G tower.
*  The only people who showed up at the 5G tower part of this planning meeting were people
*  who think 5G towers potentially give you cancer.
*  Now most people don't care that much about 5G towers and to the extent that they had
*  to make a choice they would have, you know, they want to have fast internet.
*  And so in the end the 5G tower won.
*  But whatever was happening at that meeting, it was community input, but it wasn't representative
*  of the community.
*  And this is a place where we do have representative government.
*  To my point about Shapiro, a minute ago, oftentimes I think a good way to have broader community
*  input is to actually give power to elected representatives.
*  I mean there should be checks on that, but they shouldn't be completely unable to do
*  the things that they just got elected by, you know, most of the voters in a much higher
*  turnout kind of political participation domain to do.
*  So again, it's all about where you hit the dial here, right?
*  You can go too far in any direction, but I think community input is complicated.
*  Oftentimes we are not hearing from the community.
*  We are hearing from a subset of affected interests who know how to manipulate the levers
*  of power, and we should be careful about analogizing those.
*  This goes right to what Tony C wants to know about, which is how should a climate conscious
*  member of society think about the Biden administration in the context of climate change?
*  Do you think of Biden as a net positive or a net negative for our environment?
*  And he's thinking of course about permitting fossil fuel extraction and so on.
*  I just put this on, and this is meant as no critique of Tony, I just put this on because
*  if you're in an information loop where this question feels really possibly like it could
*  come out either way to you, right?
*  Is Joe Biden, who has presided over the single largest set of climate investments ever and
*  created a whole new structure in which climate infrastructure will be built?
*  The IRA alone at this point is judged at something like $380 billion over 10 years, but as we
*  talked about in the Robinson Meyer episode, maybe it's really going to be $500 billion,
*  maybe a trillion dollars in climate investments.
*  And on the other side, they've permitted some near term drilling and made it a little bit
*  easier during an energy crunch to build more.
*  These things are so out of proportion to each other that I think the way in which people
*  get upset about the places Biden diverges from them, say on social media, it's hard
*  sometimes to keep things in perspective, but Biden is the most successful pro climate
*  president there has ever been in this country, right?
*  Climate is a relatively new issue, but obviously Trump was a disaster.
*  He's done far more than Obama just because of where the issue is and where the political
*  coalitions are, far more than Clinton, certainly far more than George W. Bush.
*  And he's given us a shot at building this stuff.
*  We may fail, but Biden has completely changed the game for so long.
*  The whole of the environmental fight on climate was, can we just figure out some way to get
*  the money to do what we need to do?
*  Now to everything we're talking about, the conversation has actually changed to the money
*  is there.
*  Can we actually build it?
*  Can we actually translate all this legislation into the decarbonization infrastructure we
*  need in the real world?
*  That is an astonishing achievement.
*  It actually slightly saddens me that anybody would look at the Biden administration and
*  what they've done at this point, where they really, they got this over the line.
*  Maybe it's not everything everybody wanted because they had a 50-50 Senate, but they
*  got it over the line and now the work can really happen.
*  We'll see what happens.
*  We'll see if it all works out.
*  Implementation is really tough.
*  This all has to happen in the real world.
*  It's not just sending checks out from the government, but they have been extraordinarily
*  successful on a pretty hard issue.
*  Climate is not an easy political issue.
*  It's not one where you have naturally very large constituencies, people who will be immediately
*  benefited by it.
*  They prioritized it.
*  They figured it out.
*  They passed it.
*  They deserve to be applauded and now they deserve to be watched over and scrutinized
*  as the real work has to happen.
*  But the stuff they did on the margin to keep energy costs down, to not completely destroy
*  their power in the midterms, that's just politics.
*  But the bulk of their legislation, it's been an extraordinary climate presidency given
*  what is actually possible in American politics, not just possible in people's minds.
*  They deserve the credit on that one.
*  So TJM has a really interesting question.
*  This was brought up a lot before Biden actually took office.
*  But let me ask you now, are comparisons between Joe Biden and FDR justified?
*  Do you have their presidencies been broadly similar?
*  They're not justified.
*  Yeah, you're right that before Biden came in and as his agenda expanded and as also
*  Democrats began in 2020 to think they might get huge congressional majorities, you have
*  this moment of maybe it'll be an FDR sized presidency.
*  And this happened with Obama too.
*  There was like maybe Obama is an extra FDR.
*  And I just have a bugaboo about this, that FDR was only FDR because of the size of the
*  congressional majority he got in 32 because of Great Depression and the anger at Hoover
*  destroyed the Republican Party.
*  So FDR when he comes in, he has 58 Democratic senators to 36 Republican senators in a much
*  less polarized time.
*  So he could actually get more from those 36 Republicans, but still 58 to 36.
*  Biden has a 50-50 Senate where Vice President Kamala Harris is a tie breaking vote.
*  When he first comes in.
*  When he first comes in, right.
*  And in the House, FDR had 311 Democrats to 117 Republicans.
*  And for Biden, when he first comes in, Democrats have a majority in the single digits.
*  You can't have an FDR sized presidency in a polarized political time in a closely divided
*  Congress.
*  And I think this is what people just often miss when they're trying to judge other presidents
*  against FDR.
*  How much legislation a president can pass is dependent on what Congress does.
*  Congress writes legislation and passes it.
*  President can only veto it.
*  And so what FDR had was a destroyed Republican Party.
*  And that wasn't true for Biden.
*  It wasn't true for Obama.
*  Probably will not be true for the next Democratic president.
*  And that just makes the possibilities more narrow.
*  I think it is really remarkable how much policy Biden and the Democrats passed with a 50-50
*  Senate.
*  In January 2020, the Democrats are going to have a 50-50 Senate.
*  What are they going to get done?
*  I would have said a lot less than they did.
*  A 50-50 Senate is never going to get you a New Deal sized presidency.
*  It just can't.
*  You mentioned Obama.
*  Michelle Oh wants to know why you think US health care reform is not much of a hot political
*  item right now.
*  My first love.
*  My first love in policy.
*  I covered for people who have not followed my work in the past health care reform for
*  years.
*  That was my first major policy issue.
*  I think there's a couple of reasons.
*  One is Obama and how successful he actually was.
*  They passed the Affordable Care Act.
*  If you look at current levels of uninsured non-elderly Americans, because the elderly
*  have Medicare, you have about 27.5 million are uninsured.
*  That's down from about 50 million or almost 50 million before the Affordable Care Act
*  passed.
*  If you look at who that is, you have a bunch of people in the 10 states that haven't expanded
*  Medicaid.
*  You do have a lot of people who still can't afford it.
*  They maybe don't get employer insurance, but they make enough money that they're not really
*  eligible for subsidies.
*  That's some of the people too.
*  You do have a big issue among non-citizens who, if they're newly non-citizens, are not
*  eligible for some of the subsidies or Medicaid in the program.
*  Of course, undocumented immigrants often are usually ineligible.
*  To mop up the end of the uninsured population, it's pretty tricky and you're dealing with
*  a lot of random issues.
*  Medicaid issue in states that are fighting Medicaid and so on.
*  I think that the Affordable Care Act was successful enough that it has drained a lot of the energy
*  from healthcare reform.
*  That's one thing.
*  Then, there's another thing, which is that one reason that healthcare reform had so much
*  energy for so long was that healthcare cost growth year after year was growing so much
*  faster than inflation, so much faster than GDP growth.
*  There's been a pretty big slowdown in that over the past 10-ish years.
*  The reasons for it are debated, but the huge cost growth problem we had that led to all
*  this bending the cost curve talk in the Obama administration that made this a huge problem
*  for employers.
*  It's not that it is entirely gone, but it is not really the fundamental problem anymore.
*  That doesn't mean there aren't ways you can imagine healthcare being way better.
*  During the 2020 primaries, we had a lot of debates over single payer in the Democratic
*  Party.
*  There's a new interesting book by Laurent Aneve, and I might be mispronouncing that, and Amy
*  Finkelstein, who are both great health economists, called We've Got You Covered, Rebooting American
*  Healthcare.
*  You can definitely come up with root and branch reforms of the system that would make something
*  more efficient, more fair, that would cover something closer to everybody.
*  But the system is working well enough for enough people that it is hard to imagine that
*  getting prioritized in the near future.
*  When I think of what I would want, any kind of Congress, any kind of unified Congress
*  and presidency, to make their top priority, it is hard for me to say further health reform.
*  I'd be much more interested in universal baby bonds, as with the episode we did recently
*  with Derek Hamilton.
*  I'd be much more interested in universal pre-K. It's not that healthcare is great in this
*  country, it's not.
*  But political capital is so limited, and enough people here are doing well enough, and the
*  sort of moving it that last couple of miles would be so difficult, that I think when you
*  imagine what are the single bills you could pass, it would lead to the largest well-being
*  improvements.
*  It's hard for me now to say that it's healthcare reform, both because its status as an economic
*  problem has abated somewhat, and its status as such, like we have this huge uninsured
*  population, has abated somewhat.
*  So I think it's just become more of one issue among many, rather than the central issue
*  that is causing both employers and budget wonks and normal people incredible amounts
*  of pain.
*  Although it hasn't solved the problem of drug addiction that's leading to more than 100,000
*  people dying every year, right?
*  But that's a big thing, right?
*  I mean, when we talk about healthcare reform, we're typically talking about financial insulation
*  from healthcare costs.
*  So when you think about what would do the most to improve health now, I think it's often
*  not healthcare reform.
*  I think things like an expanded child tax credit would do a lot for people's health.
*  I mean, we know giving people money is good for their health, and baby bonds, I think,
*  have that quality too.
*  I could think of a lot of things that would be really good for the health of the American
*  population that would probably have a bigger per dollar payout than health insurance reform,
*  which is what we are really talking about when we talk about healthcare reform.
*  Shifting gears a little, Doug A. wants to know what your view on the popular goal of
*  imposing term limits on Congress is, whether you thought about it much either way, and
*  I would say look at a couple things.
*  For instance, look at California, where you have term limits for the legislature.
*  I don't think in California or other states where you have that, the legislatures are
*  dramatically better or more effective.
*  I think if you look at Congress, a lot of really great legislators would have been term
*  limited out in a way I don't think we should think of as a good thing.
*  It takes time to become good at being a member of the House or being a member of the Senate.
*  I don't think the country would have been better off if Senator Ron Wyden had had to
*  retire after two terms, or if Senator Dick Durbin had to do the same.
*  There is a return on experience here and on connections and on skills.
*  Joe Biden was in part a good legislator over time because he learned things that he didn't
*  know in his first term or two.
*  He got much more effective over time.
*  I don't think when I look at the House, say, and I look at people there, a lot of the legislators
*  I think are the worst are the newest.
*  They're there, they're just trying to get booked on Fox News or social media.
*  A lot of legislators who are pretty solid there have been there a long time.
*  Even if you take away the political science argument, the term limits end up giving a
*  lot of power to the unelected lobbyist staffer class.
*  I just think if you look at it, it doesn't look great.
*  I think that most people would come to the conclusion that the better members of both
*  the House and Senate are the ones who have had time to be there longer.
*  Now there is a problem that incumbency can just feed on itself and people can be there
*  too long.
*  Look at Dianne Feinstein in California for a very extreme example.
*  I think it's hard to know what to do about that exactly.
*  I will say the place where I strongly support term limits is for the Supreme Court, where
*  I think you should have 12 or 18 year term limits so that the vacancies that come up
*  are fairly reliable, so that different presidents get roughly the same amount per term, so that
*  you don't have this incentive to name very young people to the Supreme Court, so that
*  things aren't just tricks of when people die or when they become too incapacitated.
*  I think that lifetime appointments are a dumb idea just in general.
*  And probably when you don't have something like elections, it do at least oppose some
*  level of accountability.
*  You want to think about term limits.
*  Or you do have elections imposing some degree of accountability.
*  Yeah, the incumbency advantage is a real thing.
*  It is also a real thing that voters are participating in.
*  So I think that it is a little bit weird to say that we abstractly know voters are wrong
*  to give the person representing them a third term and we sitting here should tell them
*  they can't.
*  So yeah, I've never been a term limits fan.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's exactly what you're saying, right?
*  He values elections in both ways.
*  The lifetime appointments for Supreme Court justices and term limits.
*  Yeah, it robs the people of their power.
*  Tom C. has a hard question for you.
*  He says, I seem to be the only liberal alarm by the real scandal involving Hunter Biden.
*  But perhaps you feel the same.
*  It seems to have amassed between $10 and $20 million in investments from a coalition
*  of very sketchy Chinese, Ukrainian, Romanian sources, none of which seem to have produced
*  any work product anyone can point to.
*  Then it sounds like Hunter and maybe his uncle Jim as well, were trafficking in Joe Biden's
*  name as Tom C. puts it, by implying that to their marks that the marks would somehow gain
*  access to Joe Biden with their investments.
*  Biden himself simply says that he didn't involve himself in a sudden business affairs.
*  But are we really just going to let it go at that?
*  Would we if these were Republicans?
*  I think in some ways that last bit is too easy in and out.
*  We did when it was Republicans.
*  I mean, I actually think in many ways what Jared Kushner did, raising billions for an
*  investment fund with Saudi Arabia, the amount of direct influence penddling Donald Trump
*  did in office, the way people would try to get access to him by being part of Trump company
*  investments and staying at Trump hotels and everything.
*  I mean, it was more direct.
*  It was much worse.
*  It was much more serious.
*  I think the Hunter Biden scandal is real in the sense of Hunter Biden.
*  The things he's done are really unsavory.
*  And the thing that has made it not yet a political scandal that is consequential for Joe Biden,
*  except on the right, where I think people want to believe something went wrong, is that
*  nobody can quite point to anything that came out of it from Joe Biden's governance.
*  So work seems to have come out of this influence peddling and also not much influence seems
*  to have gotten peddled out of the influence peddling.
*  Now I'm not against something coming out that shows this was different, right?
*  If it turns out that President Biden colluded with Hunter and there was some kind of email
*  exchange or some kind of handshake where if they would give Hunter this job, they would
*  get this amendment put on the bill or this thing they wanted done.
*  I think that would be a real problem.
*  The thing where Biden has had a somewhat laissez-faire attitude towards the activities of his absolute
*  mess of an adult son, I think there's a kind of sympathy that emerges for people in that
*  towards Biden.
*  I mean, what was Biden to do exactly?
*  He probably didn't actually know about a lot of this.
*  A lot of the details coming out with Hunter Biden, the seventh granddaughter, it's very
*  sad.
*  It's incredibly sad.
*  It's incredibly sad.
*  You're watching somebody who was never able to get his life back on track or on track.
*  He definitely influence peddled.
*  He has hurt a lot of people.
*  He's clearly hurt himself.
*  He's clearly hurt his father.
*  And if you read Biden's book that he wrote some years back when running for president,
*  and I think it is an 08 actually, I mean, the love he has for Bo and Hunter, his belief
*  that Hunter Biden become part of Bo Biden's kind of kitchen cabinet and they would protect
*  each other.
*  And then you see how it turns out.
*  I mean, the tragedy of it is immense, but it's not a scandal for somebody's son or one
*  of their sons to be a fuck up.
*  It's a scandal for that to become part of how the federal government wields power.
*  I don't think the fact that Trump did much worse than this in a very obvious and direct
*  way absolves Biden.
*  What absolves Biden so far is that he doesn't seem to have done it.
*  And if it comes out that he did it, right, if it comes out that the way Hunter was getting
*  these deals was that he wasn't just kind of wink, wink, nod, nodding, that he gets some
*  access to Joe Biden, but you were actually getting the access to Joe Biden like that,
*  that would be worse.
*  There's a part of this question that we didn't just to make it shorter than we didn't bring
*  up, but Thomas he brought up the old idea of the real scandals, what's legal.
*  And one thing I would say is that the thing that Hunter Biden here is accused of doing
*  actually does happen all the time in a much more efficacious way.
*  So in Congress and in administrations, people who are very high up aides to senators and
*  chairs in the house and of course, the presidents do become lobbyists.
*  And then they do work on behalf of other governments and other companies.
*  They do use their pre-existing relationship with people in power to try to push forward
*  those ideas.
*  Now, Biden wasn't correctly registered to be a lobbyist and all this different stuff.
*  But the thing being described here happens all the time, not from idiot adult kids who
*  don't know what they're actually doing and can't deliver.
*  But Bob Dole, the late Bob Dole was lobbying on behalf of Taiwan, right, and was able to
*  get Trump to sort of break with presidential practice and talk to the leader of Taiwan
*  on the phone very quickly after being elected.
*  These things actually do occur and they're in a kind of much broader world of more efficacious
*  influence peddling.
*  The Hunter Biden case is sort of a weird version of that turned into an absurdity that looks
*  worse because it's Biden's son, but is probably less bad because it doesn't appear to have
*  worked.
*  But again, evidence could come out that it worked in some consequential way and that
*  would somewhat change my opinion of it.
*  I will say that if Republicans want to make hay of this, they're going to have to nominate
*  not Donald Trump, right?
*  If this becomes a fight over where was the influence peddling in family oriented business
*  happening in an administration and it's Trump running against Joe Biden and the scrutiny
*  is now on Jared Kushner's Saudi backed venture fund, that's not going to work out.
*  So in a lot of ways, and it's been a kind of theme on the show recently, Republicans
*  are going to have to decide, do they want to choose a candidate who is strategically
*  positioned to take advantage of Joe Biden's weaknesses or not?
*  So far it seems not, but that's going to be consequential here too.
*  There are just so many good questions here, but I plunge into another one.
*  This one's coming from Colton L. What kind of work do you think is the most undervalued
*  in contemporary American society based on the pay, the social prestige and everything
*  else that comes with work that the work requires?
*  Anything and everything with children.
*  Anything and everything with children.
*  Being a social worker who works with children, being a teacher, being somebody who's a guardian
*  in the foster care system, given how important that work is, it is badly compensated.
*  It doesn't have terrible prestige compared to some other things, but it doesn't have
*  nearly the prestige it should.
*  It doesn't have the rungs as high on the ladder as it should, right?
*  There isn't a kind of elite teacher designation that is sort of like being partner at a very
*  big law firm where everybody knows like you've really made it and you're one of the best
*  at one of the most important things that happens in American or human life.
*  We just really undervalue things with children.
*  We talk about how the children are our future and we treat them in many ways like an afterthought.
*  We certainly treat the people who are in charge of helping them as an afterthought.
*  The pay and benefits and prestige in child care work for young children are just terrible.
*  It's a total disaster of an industry.
*  This is a place where money really matters.
*  I've said this before on the show that I think in American life, for the most part, prestige
*  follows money.
*  We give the most prestige to things that make the most money.
*  There's some counter examples.
*  Academia has a little bit more prestige and it has money oftentimes, but prestige typically
*  follows money and in not paying well for this stuff, we rob it of prestige.
*  We rob it to some degree, though of course there are amazing people in these industries
*  of talent.
*  It's just not the right societal structure and not something I think we should leave
*  up to the market.
*  Yeah, children can't pay a lot.
*  The children who need the most help really can't pay the most.
*  I think the kids who are in highly selective colleges who tell their parents are going
*  to law school, that is much more comfortable for their parents than I'm going to become
*  a social worker working with children or I'm going to work in early childhood education
*  because you're insuring yourself a higher salary in the future.
*  And that's a problem, right?
*  It should be that when you say to somebody, I'm going to go become a teacher, what they
*  hear from that is both you're going to be doing great work and you're going to be really
*  well off because we've decided to compensate that really well because we want the best
*  people becoming teachers.
*  And yeah, it's just a place where I think we're failing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's just an incredible thing that in other countries, actually teachers do,
*  you might be deciding, I'm going to be an engineer, I'm going to be a lawyer, or I'm
*  going to be a teacher, right?
*  And you rarely hear that here, which I do think is a critical part of it.
*  Just like imagine hearing from a graduate from UC Berkeley, right?
*  I'm going into dermatology, right?
*  What that calls up versus I'm going into, I'm going to work in a preschool.
*  There's nothing wrong with dermatologists.
*  They do great work, but we know what is being said when you say I'm going to work in preschools
*  and that sounds great, but you're not going to make much money.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the social prestige thing is more important even than I think you made it sound
*  actually.
*  I gather that the prestige follows from the money, but it's still a critical part of it.
*  And you're married to a teacher.
*  I am married to a teacher.
*  I was going to accuse you of pandering on those grounds.
*  Yes, I am married to someone who works in early childhood and did face that, where you
*  have people who are like, well, why aren't you a lawyer?
*  Why aren't you a professor?
*  Why are you a teacher?
*  And meanwhile, she's doing all this incredible work with public school second graders.
*  I'm curious if you see it in the world, right?
*  When you tell people you babysit New York Times columnists who act like children, your
*  wife says she works with children, right?
*  I was going to make a different version of that joke earlier.
*  I was going to ask whether you believe in lifetime tenure for New York Times columnists
*  and podcasters.
*  Absolutely not.
*  Are you kidding me?
*  No, I know you don't.
*  No, you don't.
*  OK, we're going to switch gears here into psychedelics to bring a little California
*  into our New York studio.
*  Jope F. is asking whether you've been following the scientific developments and media hype
*  surrounding psychedelics in the last years.
*  I will answer that part and say I know you have because we've written about it.
*  But from critical trials to microdosing to legalization processes in Colorado, Australia,
*  he doesn't mention Oregon, but also Oregon, indigenous communities.
*  What do you make of all this?
*  What do you think about it?
*  I have a lot of contrasting thoughts on where psychedelic therapy and help is right now.
*  So one is that the work I'm most interested in, and I did a piece on this a while back
*  and I'd like to check in on it next year sometime, is in Oregon where they are trying to create
*  a legal, although it will not be federally legal, but a legal pathway and structure for
*  supported psychedelic experiences, which notably it's not just psychedelic therapy.
*  You don't need a diagnosis to do it, right?
*  You can just go.
*  They're trying to figure out how to do the licensing.
*  They're trying to figure out how to do the support.
*  It looks like it'll be fairly expensive.
*  That's going to be really important because it's not just about whether or not you can
*  legalize them, but whether or not you can create a structure in which they can be well
*  used.
*  When I look at the research, I think the research on them at this point is quite extraordinary.
*  I would expect them in the real world to underperform the research because the research is being
*  so carefully done.
*  But we're seeing studies that are suggesting really profound effects on treatment-resistant
*  major depression, profound effects on different kinds of addictions, profound effects just
*  on people's lives.
*  Putting aside the question of what recognized illnesses and maladies you can help people
*  We have these substances that cost functionally nothing.
*  I mean, in terms of how much it costs to grow psilocybin containing mushrooms or synthesize
*  LSD.
*  We can routinely induce experiences that people count as among the most meaningful of their
*  entire lives.
*  That's a pretty remarkable thing to keep blocked up.
*  I find it kind of astonishing.
*  And it's not that there aren't risks, but you can go base jumping legally.
*  You can legally be a base jumper, but you cannot legally take a tab of acid and sit
*  in your room and listen to music and have a sublime musical experience.
*  It just actually strikes me as a very strange way.
*  We let people take all kinds of risks in society.
*  Now, the thing that worries me a lot is the financial land rush here.
*  The number of companies trying to patent it, the number of companies trying to distill
*  these into even more potent and powerful and usable, maybe even appealing forms.
*  And we're going to see where that goes because it has not yet been legalized enough that
*  you can do that.
*  There's all this money and investment that is sort of jockeying for the day of legalization,
*  whether that legalization be medical, which is probably going to be at least nationally
*  the first step, right?
*  It seems very plausible that you're going to get FDA approval for certain kinds of
*  MDMA and psilocybin treatments in the coming years.
*  But eventually, if it does become legalized right the way, say, cannabis is in a number
*  of states, the effects of commercialized cannabis, though some of them have been specifically
*  to my benefit, are not, in my view, an unalloyed good.
*  The amount of money going into very potent edibles and much more potent strains and packaging
*  and formats that are much friendlier to kids and any kind of user, it's fine if you're
*  somebody who has a fair amount of self-control around these things, but people do get addicted.
*  I mean, people say pot isn't physiologically addicting, but people very much get addicted
*  and the most money is made on the people who buy the most of them.
*  There are certain breaks in psychedelics that make it a little less likely to go down
*  the same route, but I worry about the amount of money being spent on trying to figure out
*  ways to basically get around the fact that it's actually really hard on the body and
*  the mind and you develop tolerance to trip a lot, right?
*  If you get into a situation down the road where the money is made by people who have
*  an out of control relationship, that could be very psychologically damaging to people.
*  So I think there's a lot of promise here and I think there's a lot of peril here, but
*  I'm overall optimistic.
*  I do think these are really powerful compounds that can create experiences in people's lives
*  that both help them get over terrible problems, but also help them live a kind of deeper life
*  in relationship to themselves and to the world and to nature.
*  And I think getting that right is going to require though, not just the question of how
*  do you legalize psychedelic compounds, but how do you create structures for their productive
*  use?
*  How do you create good guides?
*  How do you make integration possible?
*  That kind of period after you've had an experience and now you have to sort of figure out what
*  that means for your life.
*  How do you make that affordable to people?
*  That I think is where a lot of the rubber is going to hit the road, which is again why
*  I think what Oregon is doing is really interesting, but it's not been untroubled there.
*  years you told me this did not go well, I would not be surprised by that.
*  I'd be saddened by it, but not surprised.
*  We're going to shift gears again into the heartland of the Ezra Klain show recently,
*  which is AI.
*  And Joseph C. is wondering how much, if any, credence you give to the simulation hypothesis
*  first discussed about 20 years ago by Nick Bostrom.
*  And obviously you'll have to tell us what that is because many people will not know.
*  I don't, just for the record, I really don't.
*  So the simulation hypothesis is basically the idea that look, imagine we became a society
*  capable of running sufficiently technologically advanced, we were capable of running simulations
*  of whole societies.
*  We're not just running SimCity or playing video games, but we can just fire up on the
*  computer and fire up as many of them as we want, you know, whole universes.
*  Obviously in Bostrom's view, we would want to do that.
*  And obviously the simulants within those universes would outnumber the people in base
*  reality.
*  And so if you just assume those two things are true, then you come to the conclusion
*  that well, probably we're a simulation because there's going to be more simulated people
*  than real people.
*  And so why should you think you're one of the real people?
*  Here's what I will say about it.
*  And I've said this, I think probably in AMAs before.
*  I think this has a quality of watching a very crude form of monotheism get reinvented by
*  computer programmers, which is why it's very popular in Silicon Valley.
*  If you take the very crude form of monotheism as God is like us, like bigger, you know,
*  big throne, long white beard, more powers.
*  This is God is like us, but bigger.
*  Computer programmer with more powerful computers, player of simulation video games, but with
*  a stronger video game system.
*  And the reason I just don't buy it, and maybe this is not a good reason, right?
*  I'm not a credentialed philosopher.
*  I think it is such an extraordinary lack of imagination about how weird ultimate reality
*  probably is.
*  Just the idea that like the true answer to what's going on here is so unbelievably simplistic.
*  Just like not what is going on here is exactly what we are already doing.
*  I think it's so unlikely that that is like the full effect here.
*  I think it's a kind of a lack of humility about what we do, what we almost certainly
*  don't know.
*  Why in the simulation have we created all these other planets?
*  Why have we created a physics with such weird rules as the world is possibly constantly
*  expanding?
*  Why are there is there not more life on nearby planets?
*  Is that really how we would create a simulation, a gigantic unimaginably large system of space
*  in which at least so far we only know this one planet with life on it?
*  The whole thing just strikes me as so incurious in a way that I just don't buy it.
*  I've always had a negative reaction to it, but it's because I think it basically takes
*  our reality, holds what we know about it steady, and then asks a toy question within that.
*  We don't know anything.
*  We don't know how quantum physics works yet.
*  Reality is going to be so much weirder, so much more astonishing than it's just like
*  us but bigger, just like us but more power.
*  I just don't buy it.
*  So talking about power of generative models overall, Jordan is wondering, given the power
*  of the AI models, we already know about it.
*  And of course, there's lots in development as well to produce convincingly human text
*  at virtually no cost.
*  It seems like we're likely to see a huge proliferation of AI astroturfing in the run-up to the 2024
*  election, which is already upon us.
*  In recent years, we've already seen misinformation and disinformation be big issues both generally
*  and with regard to elections.
*  And so what Jordan A is asking is what your thoughts are on if there is anything we can
*  do to get ahead of this problem.
*  I personally go back and forth on this problem.
*  So there's no doubt that in AI, we are creating really powerful machines for creating the
*  raw materials of disinformation, deep fakes and endless amounts of auto-generated textual
*  content and images and videos and sound that sound like they came from the person you're
*  trying to smear.
*  And the various solutions I'm hearing from within the AI world strike me as very unconvincing.
*  The main one you typically hear is that they're going to try to figure out a way to do digital
*  watermarking such that something came out from an AI or maybe something comes out from
*  something real.
*  It gets a watermark of a certain kind such it can be digitally read to verify its authenticity.
*  The issue, I think, with the solution is also why I'm becoming a little bit somehow less
*  worried about the problem, which is that the people who you're worried about picking this
*  stuff up, they don't care about your digital watermark.
*  That's actually misunderstanding, I think, quite profoundly the fake news problem.
*  Fake news works when you're giving people something they already want to believe that
*  they do not want to check.
*  That is like the main way fake news works.
*  It's not like people can't go to the New York Times to check something.
*  They don't want to.
*  They don't want to be told this isn't true or they don't trust the New York Times or
*  whatever.
*  The reason people believe in QAnon isn't because nobody had said to them 4chan is not a reliable
*  source of information.
*  And so we actually also already have so much capacity to alter photographs, to spread misinformation,
*  to send around email forwards full of bullshit.
*  I'm not sure what the delta is.
*  I'm not sure what the open space is in terms of people who are the market for this kind
*  of disinformation and don't have enough of it to work with.
*  Another way of putting it is the boundary on disinformation and misinformation at this
*  point in human history, really that it is too hard to produce.
*  I don't really think it is.
*  And I think it's much more likely that you enter into a kind of cynical collapse of trust
*  than an era of rampant disinformation.
*  If you don't believe that you can trust these videos coming around, and you often can't
*  already, there are all these edited videos made to make it look like Joe Biden is having
*  much more trouble speaking than he actually is.
*  This stuff is already around if you want it.
*  We're perfectly good at creating it now.
*  It becomes easier, but I think the issue is actually the audience.
*  And maybe better stuff increases the audience a little bit, although also the knowledge
*  that there's better disinformation floating around might make the audience a little bit
*  more skeptical.
*  But I think the issue is an audience problem, like a demand problem, not a supply problem.
*  And worrying too much about the AI side of it frames it as a supply problem and not a
*  demand problem.
*  So that's kind of my slightly more optimistic take.
*  I think that the demand for this is already being fairly well met.
*  And I'm a little skeptical, at least in the near term, that shifting the supply on it
*  is going to radically change the equilibrium.
*  I just saw this really interesting documentary about Umberto Eco, and he talks in there about
*  all these fake documents that have profoundly affected real history.
*  Right.
*  Protocols of the Elders of Zion.
*  That's the example that he gives, yeah.
*  I always say this about fake news.
*  Fake news is not worse today than it has been at other points in history.
*  So I mentioned earlier that there were a lot of questions about the show and your process
*  and how you think about things, and we're going to go into a sequence of those now.
*  Let's start with Audrey C. A big chunk of what I seem to take out of listening to the
*  understanding of what it is to have a good conversation.
*  So example, you push back on something a guest argues in an elaborate and a gentle way.
*  In response, the guest doesn't always really address your point, but instead reformulate
*  something that the guest has already said before.
*  My brain goes, this person should get a second pushback.
*  He's not answering.
*  But then you don't go for it, which I come to appreciate very much as the guest is smart
*  and honest enough.
*  If they didn't answer, there has to be a reason maybe that there just is no answer.
*  So the question that Audrey actually wants to ask is, while making the show, what is
*  it that you're learning about what makes a good conversation?
*  I just so enjoyed this question because it answers itself so well.
*  That's exactly true.
*  There are certain kinds of conversations where pinning somebody down and making it unbelievably
*  clear that they're not answering a question is important.
*  The meet the press approach.
*  Yeah, the meet the press approach.
*  When you're trying to understand how somebody thinks, if they're not answering a question,
*  they often have a reason.
*  Sometimes their non-answer is the answer.
*  It's what they know on the topic.
*  It's how far their thinking goes.
*  They don't have a great answer for it.
*  That's where their thinking is at that point.
*  So I tend to have a personally, and I think this is like how conversations work between
*  people.
*  If I've asked somebody a question twice, and I find the answer unsatisfying, but I think
*  that's the answer they have to give me.
*  I'm not asking them three or four or five times just to show that I can embarrass them.
*  I don't want to say there's never a time for that.
*  There is, right?
*  If I had the president on, right?
*  That requires a different kind of interviewing.
*  But I do think there is a problem in a lot of interviewing around politics.
*  It becomes performative.
*  I think the audience is smart, right?
*  It's why I love this question.
*  Audrey understands exactly what's happening here.
*  The audience is a full, engaged, intellectual participant in the conversation.
*  They're not talking, but they are evaluating.
*  Oftentimes I will get emails that are really like, why didn't you throw the final punch?
*  And the answer is like, that's not what we're doing here.
*  I'm not trying to embarrass a person in front of you.
*  So then I just say, you know, in terms of what makes a good conversation, I think that's
*  a very big question.
*  And I don't have any one answer to it, but sometimes I think it's knowing what you want
*  out of a conversation.
*  And I think people are tuned to expect in politics that what makes a good conversation
*  is some kind of persuasion.
*  People really want to see somebody persuaded to something they don't believe or see an
*  argument torn down or, and I don't think that's mostly what makes for good conversations.
*  And I also don't think that typically works or even makes for good persuasion.
*  I think a lot of the persuasion that has happened as a result of the show happens after it ends
*  as people think about what they've said or what they haven't said or people, you know,
*  reflect on it.
*  And I think a good conversation is often people showing up in the same spirit of openness
*  and exchange.
*  And if you don't model that as a host, they're not going to bring that to you as a guest.
*  Well, we were talking about the midterms last year, we talked a little bit about this, right?
*  You just alluded to it at the beginning of the show about how so many public conversations
*  as you were talking about community board meetings, or as we call them here in New York,
*  are so performative and non real.
*  And I think one of the things that's interesting about the show, and not just your show, but
*  just the whole podcast revolution is that you have like these semi private conversations
*  that are happening in public, right?
*  Which is much more interesting than the conversations that are happening in public.
*  And I think that's a big part of what's interesting as well, which actually leads us interestingly
*  to the next question from Chris M. Could you share details around your process for digesting
*  and retaining information around such a broad array, wide array of topics?
*  Or you would have a note taker and if so, what have you found works best?
*  This is a question I think we get basically every AMA and the reason I'm doing it this
*  time is something in my process changed.
*  So we'll talk about this more in a minute, but I moved to New York and I work out of
*  the New York Times office in beautiful Times Square.
*  And there are some advantages of coming to the office and some disadvantages, commute
*  is a lot of time.
*  I get to work near you was a more positive thing.
*  But the unexpected advantage is the access to an industrial strength printer.
*  And Aaron's probably laughing because just my desk is just covered in paper now.
*  And I had a laser jet at home and I would print things out, but it felt wasteful somehow
*  to print out every article I'm reading for a podcast.
*  I think I get 50% more 100% more out of my prep, doing it on paper, particularly when
*  it's articles and shorter things as opposed to books, doing it on paper than doing it
*  on the screen, doing any prep on my actual computer where I have that many distractions.
*  I can do it and I get something out of it, but it is much worse.
*  And so I don't have a extremely structured process in the sense of, you know, this is
*  how I take notes or, you know, here's my system of markings or whatever.
*  But at this point, my process is I print everything.
*  I have this huge pile of paper and I sit at a small table with a pen and I go through
*  it.
*  And the focus that that has offered has actually been a really big step forward for me and
*  perhaps from a very simple thing.
*  So that's been nice and been a change and obviously something that connects to things
*  like the Marianne Wolf conversation.
*  If people want to go back to that and just very much about the way reading in different
*  mediums will change the way you read, absorb and engage with information.
*  But I've been surprised how true I've been finding that.
*  Yeah, that episode is a favorite of mine and the person in the squid, her book is also
*  incredible on that subject.
*  Okay, so let's talk about diminishing focus.
*  Sam M asks, well says, I used Twitter for a long time.
*  I talked about how it was great for three things.
*  I like to stay up with news, politics and sports, the latter of which I will just inform
*  the Ezra Klein audience.
*  Ezra Klein has no interest in.
*  It's not interest in, it's a lack of knowledge and interest.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I know Ezra Larkdorf long ago and that's why I'm writing.
*  Since leaving I found a much better attention span for reading articles, right?
*  So that gets to what you were just talking about.
*  With all that I still feel like I'm missing things that I did get from Twitter.
*  I'm missing people's thoughts on issues they don't write articles or podcasts about.
*  I'm missing that collective feeling when it seems like everyone on Twitter is reacting
*  to the same thing.
*  So Sam wants to know what your thoughts are and how you handled leaving Twitter.
*  Is there anything about it that you missed?
*  What did you do to compensate for what you missed and how do you stay up to date on current
*  events?
*  I did leave Twitter and I'll note that I've been playing around with threads a bit and
*  I want to come back to that.
*  And one reason I left Twitter, which is sort of before Musk completed his purchase of it
*  but when that was in the offing.
*  But the problems with Twitter for me predated Elon Musk.
*  I did a piece about Musk buying Twitter called, Elon Musk will get Twitter because he gets
*  Twitter or something like that.
*  People can search it.
*  I think it has proven my most precious piece of that year.
*  And the point was that he was going to take what was worst about Twitter because he was
*  somebody who likes what was worst about Twitter.
*  Accelerate that and so heighten the contradictions of an already troubled platform that it would
*  just slowly drive lots of people off of it.
*  Not everybody, but it was just going to turn the balance enough that people are going to
*  leave something or want to leave something they already didn't like.
*  But I will die on this hill.
*  Twitter is a bad way to be informed about the world.
*  It's just a bad way to do it.
*  And it's to the point I was making a minute ago about printing out your articles.
*  It's about what you're not doing when you're on Twitter.
*  And the best way I've found to articulate this is I think there's a really profound
*  difference between feeling informed and being informed.
*  And I think Twitter and frankly a lot of things in social media specialize in giving people,
*  particularly jittery, info-hungry journalistic types, the feeling of being informed.
*  But the people who I think of as most informed are the ones who seem the best at not doing
*  things on Twitter.
*  There's almost nobody whose knowledge of things is really Twitter-based knowledge or communicated
*  primarily through Twitter who I find that is where I get my information and really value
*  it.
*  Like for instance, Sam misses a feeling when it seems like everyone on Twitter is reacting
*  to the same thing.
*  And I would say typically what they're reacting to is the wrong thing to be reacting to.
*  So I have a burner account on Twitter for when I need to read something that's on there.
*  And I happen to have to use it on the day there was a huge amount of debate about Joe
*  Rogan demanding or challenging or offering money for this vaccine specialist to debate
*  RFK Jr. on Rogan's show.
*  And I mean everybody in my feed, like Nate Silver, everybody was commenting on this.
*  And they're all on the same thing.
*  And in a way being there made me feel like I was informed, right?
*  I knew what the zeitgeist was that day.
*  Like I was seeing the conversation and it was an extraordinarily dumb conversation.
*  It was just a bad thing to allow into your mental space for that whole day.
*  You would have just been better off reading a report about homelessness or whatever.
*  And so to me in terms of being informed about the world, actually one of the really difficult
*  disciplines is not letting the wrong mediums or the wrong people decide what you're thinking
*  about.
*  Not being too plugged into a conversation if you think that conversation has turned
*  toxic or you think that conversation has turned trivial or you think that conversation
*  is being driven by algorithmic dynamics that do not serve you.
*  That's my view on Twitter.
*  I've been playing around with threads, which I enjoy at this moment in time and may not
*  continue to.
*  We'll see how it evolves.
*  But I don't fool myself into thinking what I'm doing there is informing myself.
*  I would be much better off reading the paper, New York Times than screwing around on threads.
*  Threads is a fun way for me to sometimes screw around when I have a couple of minutes.
*  The reason I answer this with some passion is I think this has become a really bad meme
*  inside journalism that has been bad in particular for young journalists who their colleagues
*  are on Twitter, their future and current bosses are often on Twitter.
*  It feels like it's supposed to be there or threads or whatever.
*  And that is time when you're spending a lot of time on Twitter that you may not be spending
*  doing the reporting, seeing things that other people aren't seeing because they're inside
*  the newspaper or the magazine.
*  In many ways, reading an issue of The Economist doesn't give me the same feeling of being
*  informed that being on social media does because I don't feel like I know what all the people
*  who I'm supposed to know are thinking or thinking about.
*  But I think it leads me to be much more informed, like actually informed.
*  I'm reading about things I didn't already know about.
*  I'm getting ideas for things I didn't have ideas on before.
*  So I don't want to say you can't learn anything on Twitter.
*  I mean, it does give you some good links and this and that, but there are better places
*  to find that stuff in my view.
*  And I would say the same thing about threads, by the way, and the same thing about Blue
*  Sky and Mastodon and Facebook and all the rest of it.
*  I don't think if you just look at the evolution of the news media and like information, I
*  just don't think you can look at us today and look at us like 10 or 15 years ago and
*  say this has definitely gotten better.
*  Like we're just more informed or focusing on more of the right things.
*  The public has a better sense of what's going on.
*  There's more agreement on the fundamental questions being debated.
*  And if things aren't getting better, then I think it should lead you to really be skeptical
*  of claims that the platforms on which people are operating are improving things.
*  So besides getting to hang out with me, which you mentioned earlier, it's a small part of
*  your move.
*  Laura C is wondering why you moved to New York, where I will just say you have not lived
*  before.
*  And she's saying, I may have missed it, but haven't heard you explain it.
*  So can you tell your listeners why you're here?
*  Yeah, I think this is probably our most popular question on this.
*  Yeah, there were a lot of these.
*  And there were some that were sort of offended that had this quality of how dare you move
*  to New York and not explain why.
*  And the answer is largely that it's personal, that we moved to be closer to my wife's
*  family.
*  There were relevant considerations around both of our offices.
*  And so New York just made a lot of sense, right?
*  We had more we haven't had more family support.
*  We have a good community here and we have offices here.
*  And that kind of explains all of it.
*  So Nolan is wondering about something that you and I talked about the last time we did
*  this, actually, at the end of last year, you talked about a goal of incorporating a Sabbath
*  or a day of rest into your life for twenty twenty three.
*  And Nolan is wondering if you have routinely incorporated a kind of Sabbath into your life
*  and what the challenges have been that have prevented you from doing so.
*  So you and I talk about this constantly, right?
*  Because we try to leave Saturday sacrosanct without being particularly religious about
*  it. But we have sometimes failed because your column, of course, appears digitally on Sunday
*  morning, although we're pretty good about it.
*  But you feel very deeply about stopping time.
*  So could you talk about that?
*  Yeah, I put this mainly in to be accountable, having done this Sabbath episode.
*  And the answer is I have tried a lot of things that have not yet worked.
*  And the issue is that what I would like is a day of rest, a cathedral in time, a space
*  to slow down. And what my children would like is not that.
*  And so we've done some, you know, touch the bots and this and that kind of thing.
*  And I tried pretty hard, as you say, not to work on on the Saturday.
*  But I've definitely found that there is a tension between the thing that I'm often
*  seeking to feel personally, like as an individual, individuated human for my children
*  and the thing that just being a parent of a four year old and a twenty two month old
*  demands, which is, you know, my Saturdays are spent.
*  I mean, I've taken them to touch the bots and things, but they just run around the whole
*  time, which is what a touch about is.
*  And that's really beautiful. And I try to have Saturday be more of a family day.
*  And all that works out pretty well.
*  And it's really still just a lot of going to playgrounds and managing nap times and
*  all the other kids have their birthdays on Saturdays.
*  You got to take your kid to the birthdays.
*  And it's not bad.
*  But I have found the difficulty of actually getting over the hump as a young family to
*  kind of finding a little bit more of that quieter, out of time feeling like the kids
*  still need their routine. And I've taken a fair amount of.
*  Comfort from Judith Shulovitz, who was my guest on the Sabbath episode, saying that,
*  you know, until her kids were about five, it was kind of catch as catch can.
*  And they were they were working at it.
*  So I, you know, I hope that I am building some foundations and intentions that are a
*  good base on which to work in the future.
*  What do you want from not working?
*  Like, what is it you're trying to get?
*  It's not the not working.
*  I would like to have a day where I have a different experience and relationship to time
*  and productivity. And I don't mean productivity just in what I create for The New York Times.
*  I mean, it just the constant getting things done, the constant feeling that the sand of
*  my hourglass is slipping into Google Calendar blocks endlessly and that my time is almost
*  always spoken for.
*  Right. What am I doing today?
*  Yeah, look at the calendar.
*  Yeah, I have a real I mean, real discomfort with modern Google Calendar culture.
*  I think the fact that anybody can just put anything on your calendar, just that this has
*  become the way we act.
*  There's a killer there, right?
*  They say, I'm going to put some time on your calendar.
*  And I always think, well, actually, you're doing the exact opposite.
*  You are taking time away from me.
*  It'd be a little bit to me, like if everybody had sort of access in a way to your bank
*  account and they could say, like, you're going to spend I'd like you to spend $80 on this.
*  And you could go and say, no, I'm not going to.
*  But then anybody could allocate your money however they wanted if they had access.
*  And then you had to go in and affirmatively take it back.
*  It's not a problem exactly.
*  I mean, I understand why modern organizations have to work like this.
*  But I would like a different relationship to time.
*  I'm really moved by the Heschel kind of cathedral and time kind of thing.
*  But it does require a certain amount of autonomy.
*  And I think the nature of being a parent of young kids is it's just not much autonomy.
*  And weekends are really for them.
*  I mean, during the week, we have to work or both my partner and I work full time or even more than that.
*  And so, you know, it does have to be kind of oriented around their needs.
*  So I think the fundamental tension between like what I wanted out of Shabbat and what I've been able to get with it is that I think what I want is about what I want and what is possible is what my family needs.
*  And like, that's totally OK.
*  That is a phase of life.
*  Something you and I talk about a lot and that we both this is also another way of stopping or experiencing time that we don't get to talk about really in the column is music.
*  I have failed so far in my attempts to get you interested in earlier classical music and jazz.
*  And I've been trying to get as an interest in Keith Jarrett without success.
*  But I did want to ask you for three music recommendations for your listeners, because I know you're always pushing that thinking in that kind of way.
*  Always my favorite question.
*  So, yes, I came prepared.
*  So somebody we both quite like my first recommendation, which is probably the deepest music experience I've had, you know, over the past six months.
*  I'm a big Caroline Shaw fan, and she did an album with the Attica Quartet, who are also amazing, called Orange.
*  It won a Grammy a year or two ago.
*  And there are a sequence of songs on that album called Plan in Elevation.
*  But I really like this one called The Herbaceous Border.
*  And it's all strings.
*  Strings.
*  And I think I'm going to try to sell it because I'm worried if I don't sell it, people won't try to listen to it.
*  But one reason it actually unites the conversation we were just having is somehow it's become a song for me very associated with my children.
*  So Shaw has talked about Summer for Music as being motivated by, you know, what would it be like to be an ant going through the forest?
*  And I can kind of hear that in this sequence of songs.
*  And in this one in particular, there's this moment in which it ends up in frenzy.
*  And then it's like it stops.
*  And it starts to come back very slowly and almost playfully and curiously.
*  And for some reason, I'm very moved by it.
*  It always makes me think of my children waking up in the morning.
*  Right. You have these days.
*  And oftentimes to me, the day feels like it ends in a kind of frenzy between dinner and bedtime.
*  And you're exhausted and everybody needs a bath and somebody's crying.
*  And then it's like every day with them, not with me.
*  Right. Me, I wake up, I'm like, what's on the calendar?
*  What's happening?
*  You know, in the news, like, what do I have to do today?
*  I hold everything of the day before with me.
*  And they wake up and it's like, what's today's adventure?
*  What are we doing today?
*  They wake up fresh in this way that to me is really beautiful.
*  And somehow this particular song has become very moving to me in wanting to sort of meet them in that.
*  So you'll know, I think, what I mean or what part I mean when when you listen to it, which I hope you do.
*  So then the other part of the thing I've listened to most this year, and this was a recommendation from our engineer, Jeff Gild,
*  but Fred again, who is kind of known for sample of dance music.
*  He's a protege of Brian Eno.
*  But he did, if you follow MPR's Tiny Desk series, he did the best Tiny Desk I've ever seen.
*  And he live loops his music built entirely out of instruments he can play there.
*  There are vocal samples, but the instruments are things he can play in that little room.
*  So it's functionally analog and it's just virtuosic.
*  It's amazing to watch on YouTube.
*  It's great to listen to.
*  A friend of mine made the point that it sounds in ways like Steve Reich, which I think is absolutely true, which I didn't notice until he said it.
*  But, you know, people on the show know I love Steve Reich and I just think it's awesome.
*  I kind of can't imagine the person who would watch it and not think it's cool.
*  So check out Fred again's Tiny Desk on on YouTube.
*  I'll say if you want something much dancier and a little harder, his album USB kind of didn't connect for me initially, but lately it's been very much living in my head.
*  And then the final one, which is just a little easier than the other two is Maribu State.
*  I find I go back to them a lot for music that is instrumentally interesting, but also very warm and very inviting.
*  Something, you know, you don't really put on Carolyn Shaw when you're cooking dinner with your friends, but this really works for that.
*  But I figure the song I'll go with here is Midas.
*  OK, great. Well, on behalf of everyone here and all your listeners, we wish you a very merry book.
*  We even hope you get a lot done.
*  Hope time stops for you in just the right ways so that you can dig down deep, which is, as we've been talking about in a million different ways today, really the hardest problem of all, right?
*  How to focus, how to concentrate and how to really drill down into the things that actually make the world what they are.
*  I appreciate that. I appreciate you and being here and all the questions.
*  I'll be gone for about three months.
*  We're going to have a great sequence of guest hosts who are going to do we were sort of working with them on the guests and my team is working with them on the questions.
*  So we've done this before.
*  I think the shows are going to be great.
*  So keep an eye on it.
*  We're going to be going down to one a week for this period.
*  So it'll be a little bit easier for everybody to manage.
*  But I hope you enjoy it.
