# Birthrates Are Plummeting Worldwide. Why?
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [March 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW63FmvX5Qo)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  So for a long time, the population concern we've been used to hearing is that we are
*  racing towards too many people too quickly.
*  This was a Malthusian fear in the 18th century that more people would need more starvation.
*  This was and is the fear of many environmentalists today that more people means more weight on
*  the planet's resources, more environmental damage.
*  But now there's this other concern that has come to join it, that we are racing towards
*  a depopulation, too few people too quickly.
*  As countries get richer the world over, fertility rates plummet, plummet quickly.
*  In countries like America, we're now below replacement rate, the rate at which a population
*  holds steady.
*  See that in China, you see that in India.
*  In some countries like Japan and South Korea, they're so far below replacement rate that
*  their population is going to rapidly shrink generation by generation.
*  If you spend much time on today's right or among the Silicon Valley VC class, you find
*  the set of fears has become for them almost what the climate crisis is for the left.
*  You hear about it constantly.
*  For many, it feels apocalyptic.
*  It is the overarching context in which everything else is playing out.
*  But even if you don't quite know how to feel about it, and I don't always know how to
*  feel about it, it's also just kind of strange.
*  You wouldn't necessarily think that societies would have so many fewer children as they
*  become richer.
*  Money makes life easier.
*  Lower child mortality makes the heartrending grief of losing a child less likely.
*  Being better able to provide for your children would maybe make it easier to have more of
*  them.
*  Many people believe a boisterous family is part of the vision of a full life.
*  But fertility rates, they keep falling and falling.
*  And even in the places where that fall has turned into free fall, where the very fabric
*  of the society is now in question, policy to turn it around is proving completely ineffectual.
*  So why?
*  We're going to do two episodes on this.
*  But the first is going to be about the global big picture.
*  Jennifer Schuba is a political scientist, a demographer, and the author of the book
*  8 Billion and Counting.
*  Ask her on the show to guide me through what these population numbers actually tell us,
*  what they say in different regions of the world, how they might play out, and what they
*  reveal about what happens to societies as they get richer.
*  As always, my email is azirclineshow.nytimes.com.
*  Jennifer Schuba, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you so much.
*  So tell me what the total fertility rate is.
*  So the total fertility rate is, let's just say it's the average number of children born
*  per woman in our lifetime.
*  It's a great measure because in one number, you can kind of get a snapshot to compare
*  across time and across places.
*  So when I listen to the conversation about total fertility rates, there are sort of two
*  conversations right now happening at the same time.
*  One conversation that I sometimes hear on my left, I get a lot of it in my email inbox
*  for the show, is that it's way too high.
*  There are too many people, there are going to be even more people.
*  Through that conversation, I hear it more on my right, it's all over opinion sections
*  right now is that it's way too low.
*  We're facing a demographic bust, we're going to see population collapse, we are a planet
*  growing old, similarly a bunch of countries growing old.
*  How would you describe the shape of the total fertility rate and how it differs in different
*  places right now?
*  Well, you nailed it.
*  That's exactly what the conversation looks like.
*  It's like Goldilocks is in the room here with us, right?
*  It's either too high or it's too low, and it's never just right.
*  While we are perceiving this on the left and right in the world today, I will say that
*  as a student of population history, it's kind of been like that for a long time, this perception
*  about global fertility.
*  So if we look at global population last century, we saw exponential growth from 1.6 billion
*  at the start of that century to 6.1 billion by the end.
*  Women have on average worldwide about 2.2 children these days.
*  I would say that is replacement level because that point number, the point two in this case,
*  accounts for children who might not make it to reproductive age.
*  It's in very crude terms and margin of error.
*  So we're basically globally at this number.
*  But in this century so far, we are in a global demographic divide.
*  This is a century about differential growth at this moment.
*  So we have very low fertility rates in some places while it's still high in others.
*  For example, the area in the world where it really is the highest is in parts of sub-Saharan
*  Africa, a handful of countries where it's still pretty high, over five children per woman
*  on average.
*  So there's a divide, but we're all moving kind of in the same direction.
*  So when we think about going forward into the second part of the century, that's really
*  where we're all going to start converging down at those lower levels.
*  But I could tell you that, and a listener will have a reaction in one direction or the
*  other.
*  There's a lot of folks from an environmental standpoint, and they say, thank goodness,
*  let's push it lower.
*  And then of course, we know those factions in the US.
*  You know, Elon Musk, for example, sees the number and says, that is too low, it needs
*  to be higher.
*  So it's a great caveat for us to set out at the beginning that we might be talking about
*  all kinds of numbers and places, but perception and feelings about those numbers, they go
*  hand in hand with this.
*  How true is this statement?
*  As countries get richer and more educated, their fertility rate drops.
*  If we're trying to make it a causal statement, it is somewhat true, and only partially because
*  we have some really interesting, huge examples where that has not been the case.
*  And let's take India, for example.
*  So a lot of people do not realize that India is already really below replacement level
*  for the whole country.
*  And what's so amazing about that is a lot of people may remember Paul Ehrlich opened
*  his 1968 book, Population Bomb, by talking about a trip he made to India.
*  And there were people everywhere, people on the streets, people eating, people drinking,
*  people sleeping, people, people, people.
*  And now those people have a total fertility rate below replacement level.
*  And India is not a wealthy country.
*  So it's not the case that economic growth preceded declines in fertility rates because
*  state policy can serve that interventionist role.
*  So, but I want to pick this apart because I hear you saying two things here.
*  One is that you have countries that have not traveled all that rapidly up the education
*  income scale, though India has traveled somewhat up the education income scale.
*  I mean, there's been a lot of development there.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  But you have countries where you've seen a sharp fall in the fertility rate without
*  a very sharp rise, let's call it, in median incomes.
*  But I'm also asking a question slightly to the side of it.
*  If a country has gotten richer, if I just tell you country A, and do not name country
*  A, has gotten significantly richer, that country A is now highly educated, highly literate,
*  it is wealthy.
*  Does that allow you to predict with a high level of certainty that country A is probably
*  going to be low fertility rate, probably below replacement level?
*  It sure does.
*  Yes.
*  Let me ask you why.
*  Because this to me is the slightly mysterious thing at the heart of this conversation and
*  my interest in it, which is I know it is a demographic fact that when you look around
*  countries, more educated countries have fewer children.
*  It does not seem obvious to me that's the way it would have worked out, right?
*  You have a world in which your kids are more likely to survive.
*  You have more money.
*  You can get more help.
*  Your life is better.
*  You can give them a better life.
*  You can take them to Chuck E. Cheese, perhaps, as I'm doing later with my kid who just turned
*  five.
*  Lots of things have gotten easier for you.
*  And that might mean, oh, you can actually have more children or certainly a lot of children,
*  right?
*  You know, but in fact, it goes the opposite way.
*  So why is that?
*  Why does wealth lead to fewer children?
*  It sure does.
*  And you are right that this is in some ways counterintuitive.
*  Well, sure, we've got those rising income, rising education.
*  We've also got shifting values and norms.
*  And listen, I'm a political scientist.
*  I'm a trained political scientist.
*  We absolutely talk about values and norms.
*  We also know that it's really hard to measure some of these and it's really hard to put
*  them in a causal chain.
*  So when I'm thinking about reflecting back on these big changes and looking at the literatures
*  and looking at all the causality, that's the one that I think has us where we are today.
*  There's been a tremendous shift in values and norms.
*  And so, you know, I think about my own life.
*  So I have two children and I have values beyond just wanting those children.
*  Sorry to them if they listen to this.
*  Thank goodness they probably won't till they're older.
*  I do value my free time.
*  I do value a nice meal at a restaurant.
*  I value time with friends, time with my spouse, etc., etc.
*  I value my career and I value time with them the most.
*  But you know what?
*  It does compete for time.
*  And I think it's that value shift is that as we are more educated, as we have more income
*  earning opportunities outside the home, as our standards of living arise, the number
*  of children that we want shifts because it competes with other things that we want.
*  I don't know if you find that to be the case for you and your peer group as well, but that's
*  the case in my peer group, certainly.
*  I do find it to be the case.
*  Is a different way of saying this that as countries become richer and more educated,
*  become more individualistic?
*  And when you're more individualistic and people are making decisions more about their life,
*  their self-expression, their set of choices, do I want to travel?
*  Do I want to become a PhD in political science?
*  That then children are one choice competing among many?
*  I think that is part of it.
*  And I think it's just even more complicated than that.
*  And you know, I come back all the time to reflecting on the term family planning, because
*  family planning in the greatest sense of it is you plan and decide when you get to have
*  children.
*  And when you can make that choice, it becomes really difficult to decide, is now the right
*  time?
*  Is now the right time?
*  I think it's important to be in a better position to do this in five years.
*  So I think yes to the individualism, but I also think the literal logistics of it, deciding
*  when to do something, that's another kind of pressure that pushes downward.
*  You kind of keep putting that off.
*  As we know, as parents, there's actually never an ideal time to do this.
*  There's always some reason not to.
*  But I think it is that ultimate planning.
*  We can't leave that part out.
*  That's an important corrective.
*  I think to something buried in my individualism hypothesis, which is that, as you're saying
*  earlier, there's a culture here.
*  If I had told my parents, I met my partner when we were 24.
*  And if we had gotten pregnant at 24, that would have been in the scope of human history,
*  maybe even a bit on the late side, in the global picture, totally normal, and in the
*  picture for college educated, career ambitious Americans, pretty unusual.
*  And if we'd said we're having kids at 24, a lot of people would be like, yeah, are,
*  did the birth control fail?
*  Exactly.
*  Uh oh, what'd you do wrong?
*  That there is a culture around you of when do things look normal?
*  And also, we'd have been the only ones in our friend group with kids at that point.
*  And so there is this way in which, yes, there's a lot of individualism, but the individualism
*  also has very potent cultural grooves.
*  You're supposed to go and get education and then more education and then more education
*  and then establish yourself in your career and be financially in a good spot and of course
*  be married.
*  And by the time you've done all that, you know, you might be 30, you might be 32, you
*  might be 36.
*  And even if you wanted to have three or four kids at that point, you do end up running
*  or to be for women into a biological clock problem.
*  Yeah.
*  So for the total fertility rate for the US writ large is about 1.6 to 1.7 children per
*  woman.
*  That's decently below replacement level there.
*  For the more education you get, typically the lower it is.
*  It's this, you know, success sequence that we talk about.
*  Okay, you're going to raise your kids to say you're going to get lots of education, then
*  you're going to get a great job.
*  You're going to buy a home.
*  You're going to start a retirement account and get some savings and then have children.
*  So any little blip along that would then push that off more and more.
*  The other thing you mentioned that I think is very important is this idea that maybe
*  within this larger individualistic culture and within this larger idea of a success sequence,
*  there are pockets.
*  So last time I went on a first date, I was 19 years old.
*  That's because I met my husband then.
*  I was engaged.
*  I thought about this the other day.
*  This sounds crazy, but at 21 on Valentine's Day, I was 21 years old and I was engaged.
*  I've now been married over 20 years.
*  Congratulations.
*  Yeah, thanks.
*  Right?
*  That sounds absolutely nuts to a lot of your listeners, but you know what?
*  I was the last one of my friends to get married.
*  We were college-educated women.
*  Getting married early looked very normal in my group.
*  In other parts of the country, I mean, I'm from the South, I'm sure you can hear, it
*  is pretty normal to get married.
*  And then you think about my neighborhood, got lots of folks with more than two children.
*  So what you're surrounded by and how you kind of measure normal behavior, acceptable behavior,
*  those cultural values and norms, they affect your decisions around dating, marriage, and
*  having children.
*  I see this in my own world.
*  And I am part of different communities.
*  I've lived in, you know, over the past 10 years, three different cities.
*  My communities are typically pretty highly educated, but that has been different in different
*  groups too.
*  And it's got me thinking about this question, which what does it mean that the more sort
*  of choice people are exercising, the more they're putting into their careers, oftentimes
*  the fewer children they're having, often to their sadness, right?
*  I know a lot of people who wanted to have children, it's not worked out for them.
*  They want to have more children than they've actually been able to have.
*  And there are obviously values in this whole conversation.
*  And I will say for myself, which values I feel like I should even hold are unsettled.
*  I think there is something more important about having children than simple choice.
*  I think there is something about the continuation of the human species.
*  I think there's something about the connection to things and histories and generational chains
*  beyond you.
*  And also I think it's fine for people not have children.
*  But in some ways what worries me a little bit is if you want to quote unquote succeed
*  in America, you end up with fewer children on average.
*  And if you imagine an America where everybody tracks the fertility rate of the highly successful,
*  you're looking at America with a, as I understand it, a fertility rate that begins to look
*  more like what you're seeing in Japan, more like things people understand as rapid demographic
*  decline.
*  There's something here.
*  I don't know if we always describe it as values.
*  It might just be what the success sequence muscles out.
*  But I think in some ways it's important to ask if that is leading to the right set of
*  values and for people the right set of life outcomes.
*  Maybe, but I actually think there's a little bit more to it because the gap with highly
*  educated and less highly educated is not that big anymore.
*  However, it is true that the longer you stay in education, the more you kind of truncate
*  the years in which you might have children.
*  So you might not have that second or that third child.
*  And I'm a little unsettled about how to talk about this publicly because you can tell someone
*  what seems like a fact.
*  You know, hey, educated women in the US might be having fewer children.
*  What they do with that information is not up to you.
*  So you know, to the degree that we have perfect information as a woman with a PhD to understand
*  that if I'm planning to finish my degree before I have children, then I will need to do so
*  in this certain amount of time in order to make sure I'm still within that window of
*  being able to conceive.
*  That is one thing to try to limit someone's rights in terms of education or change their
*  pathway because you care about changing their total fertility rate is different.
*  And actually both those conversations are happening right now among the elite in the
*  US.
*  Is this really something that amenable to policy change though?
*  One of the things that is most striking to me about the data here and here I'm zooming
*  back out to the international context.
*  Is it across many different kinds of societies, including some that have seen this as a crisis
*  for their country for some time, I think here of Japan, I think here of South Korea, the
*  ability to shift this through policy and people have tried a lot of different things and a
*  lot of different kinds of messaging and tax incentives and this and that doesn't really
*  seem like anything has worked.
*  This seems like something beyond what at least policy at the imaginable margins of things
*  you could pass.
*  You get a tax payment for having a kid, you get your income taxes knocked off, you get
*  universal pre-k and child care and health care and the Scandinavian social security
*  net etc.
*  It doesn't really seem to do much.
*  I mean almost all these countries are converging downwards and in the most extreme cases, again
*  I think here of South Korea, which I believe is now below a total fertility rate of one.
*  So I mean you're entering geometric decline.
*  They've not been able to turn that around.
*  So why doesn't policy have more effect here and what do you learn from some of the extreme
*  cases like some of these East Asian countries where this has been seen as a genuine threat?
*  You are absolutely right.
*  Yes, we are, state policy is pretty effective at being able to take a high fertility society
*  to a lower fertility one.
*  It is generally pretty ineffective at a sustained raise.
*  That's why I say this is a permanent shift for us.
*  And so, you know, as a researcher, we want to isolate a variable the same way that a
*  policymaker does.
*  If you can nail it down to the top one or two reasons why a fertility rate is low, then
*  you could presumably put a policy in place to change that.
*  So let's say for example, we know through research that a lot of folks say that high
*  child care cost is a factor in their decision making around having children.
*  So a policymaker takes that information and says, all right, let's work on subsidizing
*  those centers or, you know, I live in a school district that didn't offer pre-K.
*  That made a big difference for me financially.
*  It would have been nice if they had offered pre-K.
*  But the state policy will fix that and then people say, yeah, but also the housing prices
*  are really high.
*  Okay, let's come in.
*  Let's talk about adjusting some mortgage rates or maybe give you some subsidies for that.
*  Yes, but also, you know, and it just kind of goes down the list.
*  So it is really hard to isolate a singular variable so that you can have a state policy.
*  And that's where we come back to how do you isolate general values and general cultures?
*  Now the extremes can tell us a little bit here.
*  You know, throughout East Asia, which has a region with the lowest total fertility rate
*  in the world, there is something in common.
*  And I first learned of it when I was still an undergraduate, I think.
*  And I actually think this is probably part of what set me into wanting to study this
*  for the rest of my life.
*  I studied Japan.
*  And I remember trying to write this paper.
*  This sounds so funny now.
*  I think it was called like Sex in Japan.
*  It was like my senior thesis.
*  And I remember learning about Japanese young women were basically being, they were being
*  vilified really in the media for living this very individualistic life rather than getting
*  married to a man settling down and having children.
*  And I think, you know, now that I've matured in my scholarship and studied more about this,
*  that was symbolic of an opting out.
*  And we see this opting out kind of running throughout East Asia.
*  South Korea has something called the four nos, no dating, no sex with men, no marriage,
*  no childbirth.
*  And so we see them have the lowest fertility rate in the world.
*  It's this idea that marriage is no longer required to have a good life.
*  You can have a job, you can make money on your own.
*  And in fact, it is not only no longer required, it might actually stifle your life because
*  of gender relations within the household.
*  You know, South Korea has paternity leave.
*  So there you go, state policy, right?
*  Oh, you say there's no maternity and paternity leave.
*  Let's give you that policy.
*  But men do not take the paternity leave.
*  And that's the values and cultural norms there.
*  So those are very important in being this counter or a limit on state policy's ability
*  to affect change.
*  So there may be ways, this may be where research needs to go.
*  How do you change culture, if you want to, through state policy?
*  Tell me about a couple of the examples here in some depth.
*  So there is the, I think to many people, to me, horrifying example of Romania that
*  sits out there.
*  You read about it in your book.
*  Then there's also, I mean, as you know, Japan has done things, South Korea has done quite
*  a bit.
*  Hungary recently has been trying to increase its birth rate.
*  You've seen things in Scandinavian countries as they build out a more gender equitable
*  form of parenting.
*  So tell me about what examples stand out to you.
*  And then were any of them effective in the long term?
*  So a lot of people who are aiming to raise fertility rates are trying to raise them to
*  replacement level.
*  And the reason they're trying to do that is because it just gives you this nice stove
*  pipe age structure where you got a steady number of people being born, aging into the
*  workforce and aging out without any strains on needing to scramble to build kindergartens
*  or scramble to pay for social security.
*  Well, we really don't have societies that hang out there at replacement level.
*  Once they tend to fall below it, they tend to stay there.
*  And if they are trying to get back to this elusive replacement level, we just don't see
*  that.
*  And so, you know, a couple of things to talk about with this.
*  One is how do you get a population, if you're a state, to have fertility rates that go back
*  up above replacement level?
*  Well, you can strip away individual rights.
*  I am not advocating for this, but we have an example of that.
*  Nicolae Ceaușescu in Romania, he said, I want more Romanian babies specifically, and
*  fertility rates were already low there.
*  So what did he do?
*  He kind of did the inverse of what China did during some of its population policies like
*  the one child policy, taking away contraception, making sure women couldn't get access to legal
*  abortion.
*  And you did see births increase there.
*  You also saw maternal mortality increase.
*  A lot of societal issues there, and it was only up as long as his thumb was pressing
*  on it.
*  And as soon as he's gone, it goes back down.
*  So no, we do not really have examples where a society goes way below and then comes back
*  up to above replacement level and hangs out there and everyone is happy.
*  Little side note here that I think is interesting, and this is really important for us to talk
*  about.
*  It used to be, like when I started my career, that we would talk about low fertility societies.
*  We were talking about democracies for the most part.
*  Now a quarter of our aged countries are non-democracies.
*  So I actually think it's really important for us to integrate that into the conversation
*  because it is easier to restrict rights in a non-democracy.
*  So that is something I worry about a lot.
*  Well we have a current example of this.
*  Russia's fertility rate is not particularly high.
*  One of the things Putin said often before invading Ukraine was that Ukraine was full
*  of what he considered to be Russian babies, Russian people.
*  People are to him power.
*  People are understood in many countries to be power.
*  And Ukraine, as Putin understood it, was taken from Russia, taken from Greater Russia, and
*  he was going to get it back and get back all these people and get back all these children
*  and get back all these babies.
*  This was an articulated rationale and it's hard to parse exactly what led to Putin invading,
*  but this seems to be one thing in the mix of his considerations.
*  I think so too.
*  And I think at the end of the day why this matters is that people look at shrinking populations,
*  of which there are already over 30 countries that are shrinking, and low fertility as an
*  existential issue.
*  And so when you elevate it to an existential issue, the question becomes, what are you
*  willing to do to change it?
*  Let me put aside the language of existential because I think people's minds shut down
*  when you begin to get into whether something is an existential threat.
*  Is low fertility a threat?
*  I mean, I look at South Korea, I look at Japan, I think of that certainly as a significant
*  problem for those societies.
*  I mean, within 50, 60 years, their population level will convulse downwards.
*  Whether a fertility rate of 1.8, 1.6 is a threat, I don't exactly know how to think
*  about it, but there is certainly an intuition that you would be a stronger country if you
*  were at 2.2 or 2.4 or 2.5 than if you were at 1.4 or 1.2.
*  How do you think about this?
*  I mean, you told me today you're giving talks there on national security, you're giving
*  talks on demography and finance.
*  Presumably those are people worried about chaos emerging from this and either thinking
*  about how to defend against it or profit from it.
*  So what are you telling them?
*  If we zoom out on the whole and we look at how globally fertility rates have fallen from
*  way high, you know, six, seven children per woman down to now two, this is a positive
*  story.
*  It's something that we worked for for decades.
*  How wonderful now that we can have fewer children and feel confident that those that we have
*  will make it to reproductive ages.
*  That's really what happens, right?
*  That's how societies do this demographic transition from high to low fertility.
*  So we should celebrate, generally speaking, getting to replacement or I think even just
*  a little bit below replacement level.
*  I don't raise an alarm about that.
*  I do, however, feel alarmed when it is super low.
*  And here's why.
*  If you just told me about a hypothetical country, you said country X, their total fertility
*  rate is seven children per woman.
*  And that's the only thing you told me.
*  I could paint a picture of that country for you.
*  And I could tell you a lot of things about that country that were probably not great.
*  I would say probably women and girls are not being educated.
*  Probably there's not great health care.
*  Probably there are no jobs and probably it has poor governance.
*  On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you told me that a country had a fertility rate
*  hovering around one child per woman, to some degree, I think that also reflects that there
*  are some things in that society that are broken.
*  That people, women particularly, although I always do hate to put it on the shoulders
*  of women, but in those low-fricility societies, it seems to be the case that women are not
*  willing to reproduce the current social structures.
*  They are not working for them to a huge degree to the point that they are willing to opt
*  out of this idea of marriage and having children and seek a different path for themselves.
*  So while low fertility, generally speaking, I think is a positive example, super low fertility
*  is something we need to understand much more to say, does it reflect that people are not
*  optimistic about the future?
*  I mean, having kids is the ultimate faith that the future will be good.
*  And we saw it go low around this time the Soviet Union collapses in Eastern Europe.
*  People feel dismal about the future and they don't want to have children.
*  Or can people just not afford to buy a home at younger ages?
*  Do they feel like they're isolated and insecure themselves?
*  And if that's the case, then those are things in society that we would want to fix no matter
*  what and perhaps the side effect, the positive externality for this will be that fertility
*  will go up.
*  But just trying to change that number doesn't actually change why that number might be incredibly
*  low in the first place.
*  I struggle a little bit with this question of pessimism and fertility.
*  And so I'd like to open it up a little bit.
*  I hear a lot from people who say they don't have children because of climate change or
*  because the world is chaos and it's been terrible here.
*  And you know, how can you bring a child into this?
*  And I always think when I hear that, that while there's truth to the many, many, many,
*  many problems that we face, which is primarily what the show ends up being about week after
*  week, the people having this conversation are to first approximation, the best off people
*  in the entirety of human existence and what it was like to be in this world in 1940, in
*  1810, in 1700 and 1500 and you know, and going all the way back where, you know, you have
*  child mortality at levels that we can't even conceive of now.
*  So going back to this idea that bringing children in is an act of optimism.
*  The people having more children right now, they're in Afghanistan, they're in Nigeria,
*  they're in Sub-Saharan Africa, as you mentioned.
*  These countries are doing differently than each other.
*  I'd much prefer to be in Nigeria than Afghanistan, but they're not as rich as, you know, post
*  grad degree Americans.
*  And so there's something here that I find odd, kind of that makes you wonder sometimes
*  if it's not backwards justification, right?
*  People for whom their children and them would have much more comfortable lives come to see
*  it as so uncomfortable, so impossible, so riven by inequality that they can't imagine
*  making that choice and people for whom their lives are much more that way.
*  They do live in societies with much more pressing levels of poverty, of war, etc.
*  Don't see it that way.
*  So how do you think about that?
*  Well, a little caveat too that a lot of these places that are war torn, they don't have
*  contraception and they are not able to actually make those choices.
*  They don't have full choice about their reproduction.
*  I think it does come back to this idea about choice.
*  And I will also say that, I mean, I'm in the same bubble you're in.
*  I spent 15 years in academia, for example, as a certain set of people who just might
*  justify their choices based on that.
*  If we kind of pull out of that group a little bit, you don't hear people talk as much about
*  I'm not having a child for the sake of the environment, etc.
*  So I do think that, you know, that is not really indicative of the US as a whole.
*  Part of the reason the US total fertility rate is low is that teen birth rate is down.
*  So isn't that something we worked for for a long time?
*  So there's a little bit of complexity here as well between like, at what point are you
*  asking somebody how many children they want?
*  At what point in their own lives are they?
*  And how much can you really trust that?
*  So right now, I'm basically would not be able to have kids anymore.
*  But if you ask me how many would you have liked to have had, I might say three.
*  Part of why I say three is because my first two were awesome.
*  They're healthy, and they are also 9 and 11 years old, which my friend says is the sweet
*  spot between diapers and drugs.
*  So they're highly pleasant children right now.
*  I think to myself, I could have had a third.
*  I would have totally nailed that.
*  But if you had asked me that when I had, you know, two under two, then I would have given
*  you a very different answer.
*  So some of this is also a measurement issue for us.
*  You know, so we don't know somebody in their 30s.
*  They're not done yet.
*  We can't actually find out about them.
*  We're learning about completed cohort fertility for people born in the 1970s right now.
*  So we're always a little bit behind in our knowledge.
*  One other question that tracks this wealth issue is that a lot of people who are doing
*  very well by global standards, maybe not the richest 1% of Americans or anything.
*  But one thing you'll hear is that it's extraordinarily expensive to have children.
*  And I have two children and I'm here to confirm that it is extraordinarily expensive to have
*  children.
*  But of course, the people having more children are poor.
*  And this seems to be validated in the data that as you get wealthier, the expectations
*  on how much you will spend on your children change what it means for your children to
*  keep up culturally, educationally, economically.
*  That's not just true for money.
*  It's true for time.
*  The amount of time that more educated parents spend with their kids is really high.
*  And it's both beautiful.
*  I mean, I really treasure a lot of the time I spend with my children.
*  And it is difficult.
*  It is, you know, I don't think people parented this intensively when they had five or six
*  or seven kids.
*  How do you think about that question, the way parenting has become both capital and
*  time intensive as people get more capital and time to invest in it?
*  I think that is a huge factor in why people have fewer children in the U.S.
*  It obviously isn't just money because we all have more money now than we did.
*  We're doing better.
*  And so you can't just nail it down to say it's expensive.
*  It really is about this intensity.
*  And some of that intensity is money.
*  You know, I've got friends with kids on travel baseball teams.
*  Oh, my goodness. A lot of money and a lot of time.
*  I just pray my kids don't play club sports.
*  Like, that's the only thing I truly want as a parent for them to not be very good at
*  sports. Yes, they mine inherited my lack of ability.
*  So I am winning.
*  Yes. They're like, can we go to the library?
*  I'm like, you bet, sweet pea.
*  Let's go. Because, yes, it is just that.
*  And, you know, when one of my friends, the same one, she's a stay at home mom, and
*  she says, how do people do it if they both work?
*  And the answer is, of course, you either have some prescriptions for some anxiety
*  medication that you both pop in the morning.
*  You know, you try to get some help, but it's hard to get help.
*  People don't live near parents who can help them, et cetera.
*  It is just such tremendously intensive parenting.
*  And that is a culture now. We also see that in East Asia, by the way.
*  So, you know, a lot of this you do see globally.
*  You know, South Korea politicians have talked about trying to change some of the
*  requirements on entrance exams just to pull away some of that pressure that each
*  child must, you know, just be raised so intensively and perfectly in the hopes
*  that that would then change the culture around the number of children that you have.
*  So, yes, I think it makes a huge difference.
*  There are only a certain number of hours in the day.
*  But I also think that there is a lot of negativity about parenting that's shared
*  in social media. Most of the stories shared about parenting online are, oh, my
*  gosh, my toddler got into my makeup today and I have to record a podcast with
*  Ezra Klein and what am I supposed to do?
*  And I hear it a lot among 20-somethings and 30-somethings that you sure don't
*  make it look like it's a lot of fun.
*  And, you know, during the pandemic, when all of us were on these video calls and
*  our kids were screaming and streaming in in the background, it didn't make it look
*  like it was going to be a very enjoyable enterprise because you don't see a lot of
*  the beautiful moments. So I think that's in there, too.
*  That's in that mix.
*  I think a lot about this particular question because I'm so caught on it,
*  because on the one hand, I get the all joy, no fun theory here, and I don't find
*  it to be true exactly. I find there to be a lot of fun in it.
*  But I'm also somebody with a pretty flexible job.
*  I work a lot, but I have a fair amount of control over those hours.
*  And I'm somebody with enough money to fill in some of the gaps that we need to fill
*  in. So, you know, we can go out occasionally, that kind of thing.
*  And the thing that keeps coming to mind for me is like this collision between two
*  ideas. One is that maybe the way we're doing it, it's not that much fun.
*  Maybe the amount of pressure we're putting on ourselves, you know, is my kid
*  reading early enough. Are we spending enough time together?
*  Are the weekends enriching enough?
*  My whole weekend is planned around what might be good for my kids.
*  It's like playground, library, going to get a bagel.
*  Right. It's just it's all kids all the time.
*  It's not my sense that that's how it's always been.
*  And then on the other hand, it's not also my sense that it was always fun, that
*  maybe it just wasn't part of the choice structure the way we thought about our
*  lives, that everything was about how much fun it would be, how individually
*  enriching it would be. So there is this kind of interesting question of one, have
*  we made it less fun than it should be?
*  Have we actually made in a way are we too pro natal of a society in a way that has
*  made us low fertility societies?
*  Because now what it means to be pro child is to treat your children so well.
*  You can't imagine having more than two or three of them.
*  And on the other side, that this question of making everything a choice about is
*  it going to be fun for me?
*  I mean, when you look back in human history, that's not always how we thought
*  about things.
*  Yes. And we have some data on this.
*  So the one that always strikes me is that a working mother today spends more time
*  with her child than a stay at home mom would have a few decades ago.
*  We're spending more time with our kids on average.
*  So I absolutely think that's the case.
*  And I do think it matters this very indulgent sense that everything should
*  maximize your pleasure.
*  Why?
*  Why is that the case?
*  And so, you know, every moment as a parent is not the best in the world.
*  But overall, I don't know.
*  I've not seen a study like, are you sad you had your kids?
*  I mean, probably somebody has done that.
*  Do you wish you hadn't had them?
*  It's very few people.
*  Something that has come up a few times here is simply that women work now and
*  nobody wants to go back on that.
*  At least I don't want to go back on that.
*  But how much is that just an explanatory factor that this idea that you're going
*  to have high fertility in societies where you have dual income, full time working
*  parents, but also there's nobody else to take care of the kids, the parents, the
*  kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the
*  kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the
*  kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the kids, the kids.
*  So it's just that that's, you know, it's like, they're not going to be able to
*  take care of the kids that that just doesn't fit.
*  I mean, you can say whatever you want.
*  You can do whatever you want.
*  You can have your tax incentives, whatever.
*  But if you've got two parents working, it's just pretty tough, particularly if
*  they're not making millions of dollars at their jobs.
*  And it's extra tough when you don't have a community that supports you.
*  My husband works a less flexible job, so we have a two-income family.
*  But anything I need for support, I'm basically hiring out.
*  I mean, there's spreadsheets for if I have a work trip.
*  Okay, this one's coming on this day, this one can't drive, so this one has to do this,
*  that and the other.
*  We don't have community support.
*  That is different than saying, do you have a daycare that opens at 7 a.m. or 6 a.m. for
*  you to drop off and how late is pickup?
*  The idea that you are living in a community with neighbors who almost have this communal
*  sense of parenting is probably way too much of a phrase there, but just this supportive
*  structure around you that's outside of policy.
*  And I wonder too, not just about the parents, but the other kids.
*  I mean, I didn't grow up in the long, long days ago.
*  It still feels fairly recent to me.
*  But I did grow up at a time.
*  I grew up in suburban California.
*  There were kids in almost every house on our block and they all played outside and they
*  all just kind of ran around as a pack and there were younger ones and older ones and
*  everybody played kickball on the garages and it wasn't that it was idyllic or not idyllic
*  and for all I know, I'm remembering this wrong.
*  But also whenever I just read older accounts of families, it's like the kids are just running
*  around and there are other kids and the kids take care of the kids and in big families,
*  the older kids take care of the younger kids.
*  And so this is one issue of how supportive the community is.
*  This other issue of whether or not there is this almost independent kid society, because
*  if there is an independent kid society and the only way to create kids society is that
*  you're on your phone, G-calling a play date with this other family from school and like,
*  no, we're not free on Sunday, you know, but what about three Sundays from now?
*  Then the parents are involved in every part of that.
*  Whereas it seemed my experience and from other things I can tell that there was a
*  little bit more of just an autonomous thing happening for kids at another point.
*  Yes, and I do think that makes a difference.
*  I really do.
*  My husband grew up in upstate New York and he talks all the time about how he and his
*  friends, guys in the neighborhood who were his same age in school, and some a little
*  bit older, would get on their bikes, they'd go into the woods, they'd be gone all day
*  long and nobody thought anything about it.
*  If we, one of our sons wants to go over to his friend's house and he wants to ride his
*  bike, we're terrified to let him.
*  Now part of this is where I live.
*  Statistically, maybe you should be a little bit terrified to let him go, but probably
*  don't need to be quite as terrified as I am now.
*  But there's a sense that what if something happened, I would never forgive myself.
*  What will other parents think if I just let my child go out because, you know, and cross
*  a major road?
*  It really is a different intensity to parenting.
*  I did not grow up in a neighborhood.
*  I grew up in the countryside and I grew up as an only child.
*  But I was completely independent and my mom wasn't saying, okay, you have now played with
*  that litter of puppies for too long.
*  Perhaps you should come inside and eat a snack or, you know, just really micromanaging my
*  life there.
*  And I totally am doing this to my kids.
*  I try not to.
*  I get that I shouldn't.
*  But I think to myself, hmm, have they done that activity too long?
*  Perhaps I should do this.
*  And yes, you would like to go to a friend's house.
*  Let me text them for you because I've heard it's bad for you to have phones.
*  So that means that I'm the person in charge of scheduling all of this for you because
*  I'm scared for you to walk out of the house and be on your own.
*  So yes, it is just a super intense parenting without this community and this autonomy.
*  And that definitely can play a role in maybe you don't go from one to two kids or from
*  two to three kids because that's another part of this.
*  I think sometimes when we talk about low fertility, we think about having kids or not having kids.
*  But there's also the do you have one, two, three, et cetera, and how that changes over
*  time as well.
*  Yeah, to add numbers to that, I think the United States, you mentioned earlier, the
*  fertility rate is about 1.6.
*  And the survey is showing that Americans would like to have on average 2.7 kids.
*  So there's this question of people who don't want to have kids.
*  That gets a lot of attention.
*  But there's also this question of people who would like to have more children than they
*  do.
*  And for one reason or another, it doesn't work out for them or it's not possible for
*  them.
*  And that feels like a place worth putting a lot of attention into because I think everybody's
*  most comfortable and correctly so with having a choice and rights based approach here.
*  And if people can have closer to the number of kids they wanted, that's making everybody
*  better off in a way.
*  Yes.
*  And you know, there's all kinds of little things about this.
*  And we did have two.
*  And we've talked about, you know, if you had a third, where does the car seat go?
*  We would have to get different cars to be able to fit a third car seat because our kids
*  were, you know, close together.
*  I have an 11 year old son who is not a small guy.
*  He's a tall guy, 90th percentile.
*  He's still sitting in the back seat.
*  He's not supposed to sit in the front seat yet of the car.
*  And that means that only one of you can have a friend come play today if we're going to
*  drive you anywhere.
*  So there's just these little logistics.
*  That difference in going from two to three is big.
*  I have a friend who has a blended family that ends up with three kids when they're all together.
*  She's like, we have to have a different table at the restaurant.
*  We have to have two hotel rooms.
*  Those kinds of things, I think, do shape people's decision making around going from two to three
*  kids and then of course add the cost in there.
*  You know, depending on how old your kids are, how close together they are in ages, you could
*  be paying for daycare slash pre-K for three at once or college for two or three at once.
*  It's something that can really make a difference for how many you decide to have.
*  Is that a way that low fertility rates end up feeding on themselves?
*  I lived in San Francisco, which is notoriously a quite low fertility rate major American
*  city.
*  And you could just feel it.
*  You could just feel that there was not infrastructure really for kids.
*  I mean, there were some playgrounds, but nothing opened early, but kids get up early.
*  And it's all these little things that just make it a little bit harder.
*  And it's not that people are being jerks about it.
*  It's just that infrastructure, commerce, culture adapt to what is around it.
*  And the more what is around it is families with very few kids or no kids, the more it
*  tunes itself for them.
*  I mean, this is very broadly observed, but there's been like a big trend against restaurants
*  really having that many reservations.
*  And if you don't have reservations, you're not going there with kids because kids are
*  not going to sit around outside waiting for a table.
*  And there's a lot of little things like that, that I feel like whenever I travel to societies
*  with high birth rates, you really notice that they feel different.
*  The whole thing just looks different in more ways than I can catalog, but in ways that
*  then when I come back, you really like, oh, I live in a low birth rate society.
*  That becomes a clear thing to you.
*  And I think what's remarkable about this is that there's such a divide between rhetoric
*  and action on this.
*  So in the US, the conversation is starting to trend toward, okay, we are a low fertility
*  society.
*  Uh-oh, how do we change that?
*  That's the rhetoric.
*  But the question we need to ask about the action then is, are we really a society that
*  values children and families?
*  And I think in a lot of cases, the answer really is no.
*  I remember reading an article maybe a year or two ago about a town in Japan.
*  It was a small town, but they were having a baby boom, so to speak.
*  And of course, this is in a setting where fertility rates have been low for decades
*  and one of the oldest countries on the planet.
*  And they started trying to talk to this mayor about what are you doing differently?
*  The answer really was we value and integrate children and families into everything here.
*  It's not a policy, so to speak, like the kind that you might think about for policies to
*  raise fertility.
*  It's a feeling and it's action around that.
*  I think that's part of why we see who's having babies even within low fertility societies.
*  It's religious communities and emphasis on community.
*  Within a church group, for example, if you go to a Wednesday night service at maybe a
*  Protestant church, there is something for the kids.
*  Someone is taking care of them.
*  You don't have to worry about it.
*  You can go to your adult formation class, speak with other parents, and you're not worried
*  about where are the kids.
*  They probably have dinner there for you, so you don't have to plan that, cook that, clean
*  that up.
*  Kids can run around, scream, and it's okay.
*  And so we do tend to see higher fertility rates among societies that are highly religious,
*  and I think that community part plays a big role in that.
*  I was going to ask you about religion as an independent variable here.
*  How much is religion a force that is capable of changing fertility rates?
*  And on the flip side of that, how much is secularization a driver of pushing them down?
*  Are there in fact any secular societies or large secular groups that have high fertility
*  rates?
*  Well, I think generally speaking, religiosity matters.
*  It's about how religious are you, which we think about, how often do you go to services
*  or pray, et cetera.
*  For example, Mormons in the United States have a higher total fertility rate than those
*  who are not religious at all, have low degrees of religiosity.
*  And we kind of see that around the world.
*  Secularism, yeah, we do see lower rates there.
*  And since we know that religiosity itself is declining, we would expect that to be a
*  pressure towards lower.
*  But I think context does matter.
*  One of the puzzles that we talk about in demography a lot is looking at Israel.
*  And I think there's a lot there in terms of exceptions, but a lot of folks know, and I
*  write about this in the book, that the ultra-orthodox community in Israel has high fertility rates.
*  But the secular Jewish community has higher than you would expect given peers.
*  And so they kind of hover around replacement level.
*  And so they are within this context of higher fertility rates.
*  They're within communities where there would be more children.
*  And maybe, maybe that's pressuring them higher.
*  It gets hard for me with religion when I try to parse out these different things because
*  there's a lot going on with how do you think about the future?
*  How do you think about the afterlife?
*  How do you think about the purpose of why we're here on earth?
*  And religious teachings do come into play there.
*  So when we kind of contrast that with a lot of folks I talk to in the environmental movement,
*  they say, we shouldn't have humans at all because it's bad for the planet.
*  These are extremists, but they're in my email inbox.
*  And so that's two really different worldviews about the value of children, the value of
*  people, the purpose of it all.
*  Behind both of those worldviews is not just values, although values are probably there,
*  but also an instrumental sense of what will happen in different scenarios.
*  So the overpopulation folks, they're worried about the human load on the planet.
*  More humans is to a first approximation, more carbon dioxide, more material usage, more
*  humans taking up habitat, eating livestock who are raised on arable land, etc, etc.
*  Then there's the other side, right?
*  And there are people who just believe children are an intrinsic good, that either it is a
*  religious duty or just a beautiful thing, right?
*  More souls in the world, more human beings who can have important, meaningful human experiences.
*  But there's also a view that sharp demographic decline is a catastrophe from a power and
*  social stability perspective.
*  So Brink Lindsey from the Niskanen Institute writes about low fertility societies, quote,
*  Whole societies will soon start to melt away, as with our personal ties to each other, our
*  ties to the social order are weakening as well.
*  Trust in virtually all social institutions is in relentless decline.
*  What he's seeing is a world that is going to fall into a kind of chaos because relatively
*  close to replacement rate societies are stable and those booming up maybe are not, but also
*  those plummeting down are definitely not.
*  So how do you think about the instrumental dimension here?
*  I think that arguments like that suffer from a significant failure of imagination because
*  what they're basically saying is that you either grow infinitely or you collapse and
*  there is nothing in between.
*  And I think there's a lot in between.
*  We just love to be alarmist about population.
*  We're alarmist about it being too high in the 60s.
*  We're alarmist about it being too low today.
*  And so I don't like those arguments that say, well, if we don't have children, societies
*  will completely fall apart.
*  No, they will change, but they change all the time.
*  Sometimes they change for the better.
*  Sometimes they change for the worse.
*  If I lived in a retirement community in Florida, I wouldn't say how awful are all these people
*  and myself.
*  What a shame that we're all happily down here, you know, with the sunshine.
*  Isn't life terrible?
*  It just looks different.
*  Let's be clear here.
*  Why does low fertility matter?
*  We've talked a lot about kids, but at the end of the day, it's because it eventually
*  leads a population to age more older versus younger people.
*  And then, thanks math, it will shrink.
*  So people equate that with individual aging.
*  And we have a terrible, pessimistic, fearful view of individual aging.
*  And because we kind of overlay that onto population aging, how could it possibly be a nice world?
*  One of the other, I don't know whether to call this a concern or prediction, maybe both,
*  is that you're just going to see a huge shift in world power as population rates change.
*  So places with more population are over time going to become more powerful.
*  Places with less are going to become less powerful.
*  I think certainly at extreme levels, that is true, right?
*  If South Korea is falling by half generation after generation or more than half, I do think
*  it is going to see its power and sway reduced.
*  I think it is going to be in more danger from neighbors.
*  And then even within societies, right, there is this question of who is gaining power in
*  it.
*  So I mean, it's a common concern or at least observation in Israeli politics.
*  The very high birth rates of the Orthodox have made the Orthodox faction in Israeli
*  politics much more powerful, which has swung Israeli politics to the right.
*  So how do you think about that way in which over time, this leads to who has numbers and
*  thus sway in society?
*  I think it's a very different answer depending on if we're at the global level or at sub
*  national level.
*  So if we're at the global level, does population equal power?
*  Nah.
*  You know why?
*  Because the rules of the game are already written.
*  So I tend to be an institutionalist in political science terms, meaning I think a lot about
*  the power of the structures, the power of the rules of the game.
*  And guess what?
*  are so set in stone right now that to think about India challenging those rules, challenging
*  that order, it's not going to happen in the next couple of decades, even though they're
*  now the most populous country on the planet.
*  But I think there's more to it at the sub national level there.
*  But again, I'm an institutionalist.
*  So what are the rules of the game?
*  If you have rules of the game that allow small interest to take political power, say for
*  example, the type of parliamentary system where you could get 20, 30% of the vote and
*  come to rule in the country, then population sizes will matter in one way.
*  They can potentially take over that governance there.
*  I think in the US, it's more complicated because we're still on these two parties and it's
*  we're not getting out of these two parties anytime necessarily soon.
*  So it is harder for a particular niche, even though they may be growing in population,
*  to take over the whole political governing landscape.
*  You said at the beginning here, look, there are all these facts, and then there's what
*  you do with the facts.
*  What do you do with them?
*  We've talked a bit about the sort of overpopulation take, we've talked a bit about the decline
*  is take.
*  What is your orientation?
*  When you look at societies, you know, 1.5, 1.6, it seemed to be dropping a little bit
*  lower over time.
*  How do you think about it?
*  And how do you think about where they should be thinking about going from here?
*  I'm trying to strike a balance between showing how important it is to always view demographics,
*  but not so important that you're willing to take away people's rights or focus solely
*  on that number, those population numbers, to the extent that you forget to deal with
*  the people who are there.
*  So I would think, for example, if we know climate change is happening, it would be a
*  mistake to focus only on stopping or reversing climate change while the waters are rising
*  and coming above your front porch.
*  You should also probably put your house up on some stilts.
*  We need to think instead about how to have resilient societies that adapt to what is
*  there.
*  And knowing that I've already said, we should pay attention to super, super low fertility
*  rates.
*  If we're just hanging out at this below replacement level, but steadily this 1.5 to 1.9 area,
*  this is not doom and gloom.
*  It's only doom and gloom if you are not willing to change anything else about it.
*  Do you have a pay as you go entitlement system where you need a constant influx of workers
*  to financially support those who are exiting the workforce?
*  Well then, yeah, you're right, probably is going to be doom and gloom.
*  So we have to have that adaptation now.
*  We have to have that resilience and we are wasting time and resources in not doing that
*  and instead trying to put the genie back in the bottle.
*  But at the same time, I do think it's important for us to support families and children for
*  the purpose of supporting families and children because otherwise, what is the point of it?
*  What is the point?
*  I think society is made up of us as people.
*  A lot of times with these aggregate numbers we talk about, we forget that they are just
*  an aggregate of a bunch of individual decisions.
*  And I want to live in a society that is optimistic about the future where there are children
*  and older people and people of working ages.
*  And to me, that's really the point of it all is to see us as humans as valuable.
*  I think that is a good place to end.
*  And always our final question, what are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  So I have three books that I love for different reasons.
*  So I love Extra Life by Steven Johnson.
*  It's zooming out to say, isn't it remarkable that we have basically added an extra life
*  because of how much we have improved health and life expectancy.
*  I also love this book by Paul Saban that I used to teach out of and it is called The
*  Bet.
*  Paul Ehrlich, Julian Simon and Our Gamble Over Earth's Future.
*  And what I like about it is there was not always the case that there was this huge divide
*  between the left and the right over environmental ideas in the US.
*  There was a time when we were kind of united on that.
*  It just kind of traces that history of how we came to be divided on this issue of over
*  population that I think is really important thing to Chronicle.
*  It's a really interesting book.
*  And then the third one, it's more of an academic book, but if you want a history of some of
*  the most interesting demographic engineering that we've seen in the world, it's a book
*  called Reproductive States.
*  And it's edited by Ricky Solinger and Mie Nakachi and it's global perspectives on the
*  invention and implementation of population policy.
*  And I think it's fascinating to look at how individual countries will have this very anti-natalist
*  policy for decades and then fertility will go low and they'll freak out and then they
*  will put into place pro-natalist policies, just like a flipping a switch, you know.
*  But you can really see these interventions over time in different countries and it's
*  really fascinating view into countries like China, India, et cetera.
*  Jennifer Schuba, thank you very much.
*  Thank you so much.
