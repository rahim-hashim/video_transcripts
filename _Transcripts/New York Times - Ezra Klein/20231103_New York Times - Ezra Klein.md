# She Polled Gazans on Oct. 6. Hereâ€™s What She Found.
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n9Xu5KrH3Q)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  So I want to start today with a question I've been getting, which is why I've been treating
*  Israel as the primary agent here.
*  To quote one email, all you can do is condemn the brutality of the bombing.
*  Well, guess what?
*  Do you want to stop the bombing?
*  Release the hostages now, and maybe, maybe something will change.
*  You want fuel and electricity in Gaza?
*  Tell Hamas.
*  Or here's another email.
*  Are you planning an episode called, If Not This, Then What Should Hamas Have Done?
*  After all, you had an episode on what should Israel do.
*  It makes sense to take the exact perspective on Hamas.
*  I get where this is coming from.
*  I really do.
*  There would be no invasion of Gaza right now.
*  No massive air bombing campaign.
*  No siege of food and water.
*  If Hamas hadn't butchered more than 1,400 people in Israel and taken hundreds more hostage
*  on October 7th, they did this.
*  It should be on them to end it.
*  Ghazi Hamad, a Hamas official, went on Lebanese television the other day, and he said, quote,
*  We will do this again and again.
*  The Al-Aqsa flood is just the first time, and there will be a second, a third, a fourth.
*  That is truly monstrous.
*  Israel is right, I've said this before, to want to destroy Hamas, or at least destroy
*  the threat that it poses.
*  Every country in the world would want the same in its position.
*  But if you agree with what I just said, that Hamas is truly monstrous, that there is something
*  truly chilling about an organization that will slaughter Israeli civilians and then
*  hide among Palestinian civilians, then there is some dissonance between the desire to treat
*  Hamas as the brutal organization that it is, and also to say that every Palestinian in
*  Gaza should be dependent upon that same immoral terrorist organization making humane, decent
*  decisions.
*  That Israel is seen as at least potentially a moral restrained actor here is a strength.
*  Israel's weakness, or one of its weaknesses, is how much of that reputation it gave up
*  in recent years.
*  The Netanyahu administration spent the last decade coexisting with and even strengthening
*  Hamas because that weakened the more moderate Palestinian authority.
*  They spent that decade annexing territory in the West Bank.
*  As Bezalel Smotrich, the current finance minister, said in 2015, the Palestinian authority is
*  a liability.
*  Hamas is an asset.
*  That's one reason so many Israelis are so furious, so properly furious at the Netanyahu
*  government right now.
*  But one thing Israel and Israelis have is the benefit of complexity.
*  Even though the Netanyahu administration won its power in elections, we understand that
*  it is not synonymous with Israelis and that distinction is proper.
*  But I don't think that the American conversation, at least, always extends that same complexity
*  of Palestinians.
*  I want to go back to that interview with Ghazi Hama, the Hamas official.
*  After saying that Hamas wants a second, third, fourth Al-Aqsa flood, he says, well, we have
*  to pay a price?
*  Yes, and we are ready to pay it.
*  We are called a nation of martyrs, and we are proud to sacrifice martyrs.
*  One wonders whether so many Gazans want to be sacrificed as martyrs by Hamas.
*  There have not been elections in Gaza in almost 20 years.
*  The polling we have shows the Gazans dislike and distrust Hamas.
*  But I think Palestinians are much more often spoken of, at least in America, as an undifferentiated
*  mass.
*  Support for Hamas is often assumed, which is one reason I think so many are willing
*  to hold them collectively responsible for what Hamas does.
*  One intention I have for my coverage here is to hold true the humanity and the complexity
*  of both sides, except for in some truly lost parts of the left or the anti-Semitic parts
*  of the right.
*  I don't think that's a problem Israelis face in America.
*  I do think it's a problem Palestinians face.
*  So I asked Amani Jamal, Dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs
*  on the show.
*  Dr. Jamal is Palestinian.
*  She spent much of her childhood in Ramallah, and she's also one of the leaders of the Arab
*  Barometer Project, which among other work has been doing deep survey work on Palestinian
*  public opinion.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein Show at nytimes.com.
*  Dr. Amani Jamal, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you so much, Ezra, for having me.
*  So we're talking today's Tuesday, October 31st.
*  When was your last survey in Gaza conducted?
*  Our last survey in Gaza was conducted at the end of September through October 6th.
*  So it wrapped one day before Hamas's attack?
*  Yes.
*  That is wild.
*  It's very wild.
*  We had a couple of responses on October 7th, but we had primarily wrapped up the work on
*  October 6th.
*  I want to go through some of the main results.
*  One thing you did was you pulled attitudes on Hamas.
*  What did you find in Gaza, and what did you find in the West Bank?
*  So generally in Gaza, what we found is that trust for the Hamas government was low.
*  It seems to be on the decline.
*  So we found about 67% said they had no trust or little trust in Hamas.
*  Furthermore, when we asked people about if elections were held today, as you know, Ezra,
*  elections have not been held in the Palestinian territory since 2006.
*  So for almost 20 years now.
*  But when we asked people if elections were held today, who would you vote for?
*  What we also found is that about a quarter said that they would vote for Ismail Haniyeh,
*  who is the leader of Hamas, in a presidential election.
*  Mahmoud Abbas did not receive very high scores either.
*  So the Palestinian Authority, it appears, also doesn't have great legitimacy.
*  And when we asked people in Gaza, who is their preferred party?
*  27% said Hamas, which is lower than a third, closer to a quarter.
*  And then 30% said they would favor Fatiha, which is also less than a third.
*  So again, it appears that both Hamas and Fatiha do not enjoy great support or
*  popularity among the citizens in Gaza.
*  In fact, what we found is that a good percentage of citizens in Gaza have little
*  faith in either of the political parties.
*  So if they don't want the leaders of Hamas or Fatiha to represent them,
*  who was the most popular choice for leadership?
*  So the most popular leader, but not by a great margin, is Marwan Barghouti,
*  who is in Israeli prison for his terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens.
*  And what do they like about him?
*  So despite his atrocious sort of track record with Israelis,
*  he is perceived to be a leader that lacks corruption.
*  A leader that, if given the chance,
*  would lead the Palestinian people honestly and favorably.
*  We really don't have much of a record of that.
*  So Marwan Barghouti has never really held an official public office
*  in the way of representing the Palestinian people.
*  So this is nevertheless a perception that he would rule honestly and
*  would have a government that wasn't very corrupt.
*  This gets at, it's something that I saw in your polls, that I saw in other polls
*  that looked at of Palestinians both in the West Bank and Gaza.
*  Which is that, I think in America we think about the dominant,
*  maybe even the only issue, as being the relationship and the conflict with Israel.
*  When you look at the polling, corruption is often the top issue.
*  And corruption is, I think,
*  often believed to be why Hamas won in Gaza in 2006 in the elections.
*  It did happen.
*  Now Hamas is seen as incredibly corrupt.
*  Corruption does seem to be at least a top domestic issue.
*  That is correct, Ezra.
*  And that's a really good point to discuss with your viewers,
*  which is that the average Palestinian on a day to day is not only assessing
*  the condition of their livelihood vis-a-vis the Israeli occupation.
*  But they are also juxtaposing their perception vis-a-vis the governing
*  authority.
*  So in the West Bank, that is the Palestinian authority.
*  In Gaza, it is the Hamas-led government.
*  And on both ends, Palestinian perceptions of corruption are very high.
*  And among Palestinians, especially because there's this discourse and
*  there's this feeling that they've already been disadvantaged by the Israeli
*  occupation and by an international community that more or
*  less has been silent on the occupation.
*  That to add insult to injury, Ezra,
*  you then get governing authorities that are also corrupt.
*  That are also dispossessing Palestinian people of their material well-being.
*  And this is just, again, a deep wound for
*  the Palestinians to have to live and contend with levels of corruption.
*  So we see this in our polls and we see this in our interviews and
*  our focus groups that it's just like yet another layer of injustice.
*  One thing
*  I
*  was
*  thinking
*  about when reading
*  discussing their situation internally and the way that their relationship with Hamas is seen,
*  particularly from Gaza, externally. And I want to read you something that Israeli president Isaac
*  Herzog said about Palestinians in Gaza right after the attacks. And he said, quote,
*  it is an entire nation out there that is responsible. It's not true, this rhetoric
*  about civilians not aware, not involved. It's absolutely not true. They could have risen up.
*  They could have fought against that evil regime. So how do you think about that?
*  So, I mean, that is just really with all due respect to Ezra as an analyst, it is just really
*  inaccurate. We know that Hamas leads in a very dictatorial fashion in Gaza. We know from the poll
*  that 40% said that the freedom of expression in Gaza was guaranteed to a great or moderate extent,
*  which means about 60% did not believe the freedom of expression was guaranteed.
*  And then about close to 70% believe that the right to participate in a peaceful protest
*  was not protected under Hamas rule. So increasingly, Palestinians in Gaza,
*  at the eve of these atrocious attacks, were feeling that their freedoms and ability to
*  express their opinion was limited, to express their opposition to the Hamas government was limited.
*  You know, in Gaza and elsewhere, even on the West Bank, it's increasingly become common
*  to hear of stories where Palestinians oppose the leaderships and they are arrested for criticizing
*  the government. So you have a population that is basically under this Israeli occupation,
*  but then living under authoritarian rule of their own leaders, and then the world community or
*  President Herzog basically saying, well, they're going to be held responsible for what Hamas did.
*  That is just inaccurate. That does not reflect the realities on the ground.
*  And Hamas has not been representative of the Palestinian people.
*  Everybody keeps basing the Hamas popularity on the 2006 election, Ezra, which you mentioned.
*  And remember, the 2006 election, even if it brought Hamas to power, that election never
*  was based on a landslide for Hamas. Hamas secured 44% of the popular vote in that election. And to
*  your point, a lot of that vote was mobilized on ending corruption of the PA. One thing that is
*  striking me across every poll I can find is a boss who I think is often considered fairly moderate,
*  at least for this conflict, is almost unfathomably unpopular. Why? I mean, it's not only that he's
*  unpopular. 52% of Gazans believe the PA, the Palestinian Authority, which is led by Mahmoud
*  Abbas, is a burden on the Palestinian people. And 67% in Gaza would like to see Abbas resign. So these
*  are horrendous polls in terms of thinking about what alternate leaders are there for the Palestinian
*  people. But here's the issue. Yes, the Palestinian Authority is very corrupt. It's been well
*  documented, Ezra. I've written on this in my book, Barriers to Democracy. Having said that,
*  if you go back to 1993 and after that, the whole creation of the Palestinian Authority
*  was to bring Palestinian people an aura of autonomy and independence in a two-state solution that stood
*  side by side with Israel. And year in and year out, what's happened since Oslo is that the
*  Palestinian Authority increasingly became a governing authority that was governing much
*  more authoritatively while being seen as unable to bring any of the building blocks of building
*  that Palestinian state, moving that peace process forward. Settlements have expanded.
*  If you go to the West Bank, if you visit the West Bank year in and year out, Ezra, you'll see that
*  the land of the West Bank has shrunk and it is divided where you can't travel between towns.
*  And all the while, the Palestinian Authority is governing more authoritatively in these small
*  enclaves on the West Bank. So that has been a disastrous formula for Mahmoud Abbas and the
*  Palestinian Authority is the fact that before their very eyes, Palestinians have seen even
*  further dispossession. The idea of a two-state solution, although on a personal level,
*  I have always supported and still support. I understand that it's very difficult to talk
*  about a two-state solution right now because the realities on the ground have changed drastically
*  to the extent that it's very unclear about whether a two-state solution is even possible.
*  And the truth is, Ezra, you can't blame the failure of the peace talks on Mahmoud Abbas and the PA.
*  So we can talk about the corruption, we can talk about authoritarian rule, but the failure of the
*  peace process, you cannot lay that responsibility on the doorsteps of the Palestinian Authority.
*  The truth is, Israel, for the longest time, especially under the leadership of Benjamin
*  Netanyahu, has chosen not to engage in a peace process, has chosen not to work.
*  I don't think there's any doubt that Netanyahu has done almost everything he could to not have
*  negotiations in a serious way with Abbas. And in fact, it has been well reported and well discussed
*  that part of the way that he engaged with Hamas was meant to weaken the Palestinian Authority,
*  so he didn't have to make those kinds of concessions. But I do want to ask here that one
*  thing I will often hear from Israelis is that there have been opportunities. And part of the
*  reason they have given up on the two-state solution is their sense that those opportunities were not
*  taken, including by Abbas. And the specific one I often hear about is an offer made by Hud Omer,
*  sort of towards the end of his administration. And I'm always so careful when I wade into this,
*  because the claims and counterclaims are very complicated. But there was some kind of offer
*  from Omer, and the details on it differ between the two camps. That in his telling, at least,
*  was more land than had been offered before, and the feeling was that Abbas did not respond,
*  although again, that is contested by Abbas's camp. But I'm curious what you make of that
*  sort of moment right before Netanyahu comes in and the whole politics of this changes.
*  So this is a good point, Ezra. And like you, I have heard from my Israeli friends and colleagues
*  who were involved in the Track 2 negotiations and from the Palestinian side. And quite honestly,
*  you will get accounts that say, yes, this was offered, but it was never put in writing.
*  Or this was never offered, but they say it was. Or the Israelis are still talking about being
*  afraid of the Palestinian right of return, that there was actually significant movement on that
*  in the negotiations. So you're always hearing the conflicting sides. But the truth is this ongoing
*  narrative around peace, which is that everybody has this one opportunity to either take it or
*  leave it. And if people didn't take it, or they couldn't come to that agreement, it means that
*  we're never going back to the negotiation table. And I've given this so much thought, as you can
*  imagine. The real argument should be, is that so much progress was made at Camp David. So much
*  progress was made, maybe with the ulmert plant. And then so much progress was made with what Mahmoud
*  Abbas and the PA were willing to accept. Why did we not build on those successes? Because every time,
*  Ezra, there were political forces that did not want peace. They did not want further concessions.
*  They did not want the negotiation and basically the ability to come up with a resolution
*  of compromise. These leaders would take us back. So rather than the discourse always focusing on
*  the fault of the peacemakers who are really doing the hard work, I think we need to start asking our
*  questions about the leaders who came and destroyed the peace process. The leaders who came and said,
*  we don't want peace. We don't want to work with the Palestinian Authority and we'd rather work
*  with Hamas. That's where the focus and the scrutiny should be. I think the peace process
*  has been vilified because there were always groups and leaders who didn't want peace. But the ulmerts
*  of the world, the Ehud Baraks, even Yasser Arafat, Mahmoud Abbas and the PA, the concessions that the
*  world was willing to make or these leaders were willing to make, the heroic concessions,
*  the courageous concessions, the concessions that it's Hakra Bin before he was assassinated for his
*  concessions, right? That they were willing to make to bring peace. Why are these efforts vilified and
*  always put in this very negative framework rather than saying, oh my God, so much progress was made?
*  You've had the recognition of the state of Israel. You have the denunciation of terrorism
*  by the Palestinians. You had the willingness of land swaps to keep some of the settlements on
*  the West Bank. You had security arrangements and security agreements where there were joint security
*  patrols patrolling a lot of the areas between Israel and the West Bank. There was a lot of
*  cooperation not only on security but health and education and the economy. This was an enormous
*  amount of work for coexistence and for mutual peace. And it was discarded, Ezra, under the
*  guise of, oh, you know, they couldn't just agree at this one meeting on something. So what? Let's
*  have another meeting. Let's have another effort. Which world leaders, since the failure of Camp David,
*  have tried to seriously bring the Palestinians and Israelis together to push this two-state solution
*  forward? I do think you've seen a couple people try. There were some very ill-fated attempts from
*  John Kerry under Obama when he was an envoy on this. The Trump administration, I think, moved to
*  an idea that you could make peace between Israel and other Arab nations and you didn't have to do
*  anything with the Palestinians at all. There wasn't very much happening under Joe Biden.
*  But I think one reason this has begun to rot is a sense that it's impossible, both for the reasons
*  you lay out that there are many more settlements now on the ground, that the two sides are further
*  apart, but also that people don't want it, that the polling, the public has turned against it.
*  And you did do polling on this in Gaza. So I wanted to ask what Gazans in your surveys said
*  about how they wanted to see the conflict resolved, what solution they were in favor of.
*  Yeah. So we asked people in Gaza of the three solutions, a two-state solution that recognizes
*  Israel and is based on the 1967 borders, a second option of a confederation between Israel and
*  a future Palestine, and the third option being a one-state solution. And that's the one-state
*  solution where Israelis and Palestinians would all live in one state, enjoy equal opportunities.
*  Now, Ezra, there was a fourth option that was other, that people could basically write in,
*  any other option. About 20% opted for that other option, and they opted for armed resistance against
*  Israel. But that was only 20%. A majority supported the two-state option.
*  So I have some questions about this. So you did this poll in conjunction with the Palestinian
*  Center for Policy and Survey Research. And so I was looking at some of their other recent polls,
*  and they seem to show very, very different results. So this poll, as you mentioned,
*  done in September and October, they had a June 2023 poll that found, quote,
*  support for the concept of the two-state solution stands at 28%, and opposition stands at 70%.
*  So what should I make of the difference between these two results?
*  So this is really a good question, Ezra, and I'm glad that you asked it, because we did spend a lot
*  of time before we wrote up our results. We looked at the Palestinian survey that you just cited. So
*  that survey generally was sort of framed around the failure of Oslo almost 30 years later. So
*  that's the general tenor of that survey. So there's a series of questions in that survey that
*  highlight the failure of the two-state solution, the failure of the peace process, and the failure
*  of Oslo. So what we say, what we are sort of arguing, is that the Palestinian sample of this
*  particular survey was basically fed different primes to put them in a very negative framework
*  about the two-state solution. And I'm not saying that that was the intention of the Palestinian
*  center. We work with them. Khalil Shkaki, somebody we hold in very high regard as a colleague.
*  He's the head of the center.
*  Yes. But here's Q33. Question 33. President Abbas made a speech at the U.N. in which he described
*  the evolving conditions in the West Bank as a one-state reality with two peoples, the Palestinian
*  and the Israeli, and described it as a reality of apartheid. He emphasized that if the Israeli
*  occupation is not ended, the Palestinians will demand equal rights in a one-state for two people.
*  Are you for or against a one-state solution where the two sides enjoy equal rights? That's Q33.
*  Then Q35, it asks, do you support or oppose the solution based on an establishment of a
*  Palestinian state alongside Israel known as the two-state solution? So after you've told
*  them that they're living in apartheid, after you've told Palestinians that their president
*  Abbas says they're living in apartheid, and more or less the two-state solution has failed,
*  Q35 comes after to say, do you support that? So in other words, the survey was not necessarily
*  about a straight-up, do you support a two-state solution? The survey was more about,
*  do you believe a two-state solution is even viable given that your president says you live
*  under apartheid? Does that make sense? It does. I mean, I will say that I looked across a couple
*  surveys, so I take your point that that survey was about the failure of the also accords.
*  There's another survey from December 2022 that shows that given sort of force options of what
*  should happen next in the conflict, 31% of Palestinians choose reach a peace agreement,
*  but 40% choose wage and arms struggle against Israeli occupation. And my point is not that one
*  is right and one is wrong. I feel like what you're saying is in some ways more interesting than that,
*  that if there is so much malleability in public opinion among Palestinians, and for that matter,
*  among Israelis, which also change in different surveys, if there's so much malleability in
*  Palestinian views on what should be done here, depending on how questions are asked and questions
*  are primed, that also implies actually quite a lot of malleability potentially in reality that
*  how people might feel about the peace process in one context, right? One way, one moment in the
*  conflict, one administration they see in Israel, one way of being treated, and how they feel in
*  another could change very dramatically such that it sounds to me that the takeaway from this would
*  be you should never really see the opinion here as fixed. I think that's a good way to say,
*  to put it as well, or more importantly, let's just put it this way. And I, you know, I'm not an expert
*  on Israeli opinion, but I have colleagues working on Israeli opinion, is that the average citizen
*  in Palestine, Israel is a rational citizen. And in the end of the day, the average citizen in
*  Palestine, Israel wants a life of dignity, security, and respect. And if that's how we frame
*  the advantages of peace, if that's how leaders talk about peace, rather than it being a liability
*  and it being basically something that is so horrible because we tried it 30 years ago,
*  we're never going to try it again, then guess what? People are not going to support it.
*  And so it comes down to what messages and what our leaders are promoting on both sides.
*  Now to be fair, again, to back the Palestinian Authority, they have always called for a two-state
*  solution. Hamas has not, but Hamas has enjoyed a lot of room to grow and to consolidate its authority
*  in Gaza. The Netanyahu government has a coalition that is calling for the ethnic cleansing of the
*  West Bank and Gaza of Arabs and Palestinians. I mean, how is that framing a conversation about
*  the benefits of mutual recognition and coexistence? Well, I think we can agree that the leaders in
*  power right now are definitely not framing that conversation. I do want to bring this back actually
*  to Hamas because you've done survey work there over long periods of time. And so you've seen
*  how support for Hamas changes during periods of conflict with Israel, during periods of
*  more armed resistance, during periods of war. What have you seen there? What happens to support
*  for Hamas during periods of increased conflict with Israel? So what we see typically, Ezra,
*  is that when you have these cycles of violence and when you have basically what's seen as the
*  indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians, especially in Gaza, this bodes well for support
*  for Hamas. That, okay, you know what? We're going to support this terrorist movement because the
*  world is not listening. Even when we were not supporting Hamas, we were told we were supporting
*  Hamas and we were punished for not even supporting Hamas. So it does bode well in terms of support
*  for Hamas. I mean, think about what that psychologically might do to our population.
*  There is a tendency from outside to be primarily interested, I think,
*  in what Gazans think of the peace process or the lack of a peace process of Hamas as governing
*  authority. But obviously, they, like almost all people, are concerned with their day-to-day life.
*  And one of the things that really struck me in your polling had to do with simply the questions
*  about material reality and particularly questions about food and how that's changed over time. Can
*  you walk me through that? So what we found, Ezra, is about three-fourths, it's about 75%,
*  of Palestinians in Gaza saying that they had run out of food and lacked the money to buy more at
*  some point during the previous 30 days. So that's three in every four individuals saying that they
*  didn't have enough food to eat. And that number is up significantly from our 2021 survey, where only
*  51%. So about half of Gaza said they couldn't afford to eat. I mean, Gaza has been under
*  blockade. And so this blockade has always posed significant economic challenges. I know there are
*  those out there who sort of think that Gaza could have been Dubai. The truth is, under the conditions
*  of the blockade, that's just not feasible. Before all of this, they were relying on about 500 trucks
*  a day of assistance and aid from the global community and from the international organizations.
*  And we see today some of the global speakers applying the entry of 20 or 30 trucks since the
*  last three weeks of this devastation happening in Gaza. So there are dire, dire humanitarian
*  conditions. And we see this in the poll even before October 7th, Ezra. So you can only imagine
*  today how much worse it is. And so then the question does become, how well is Hamas doing
*  in terms of governing and providing for the people of Gaza? Clearly from our survey, we're not finding
*  evidence that the average Palestinian was very content with the economic situation in Gaza before
*  October 7th. This was one of the most surprising findings between your survey, that when you asked
*  Gazans who they blamed for food insecurity, from the outside, you might think, well, they'll blame
*  Israel because of the blockade, but that isn't what most of them said. How did they think about it?
*  So they did mention the Israeli blockade, but the response that was cited most frequently by
*  Palestinians was basically the Hamas government, the mismanagement of the Hamas-led government.
*  And again, this speaks to the issue that we were talking about, which was levels of corruption.
*  So the average Palestinian might be thinking like, yes, there's this blockade. Yes, this blockade is
*  horrendous. But on top of it, you have mismanagement of the food and the resources of the state that is
*  resulting in an unequal dispersion of resources or foods or aid to people. So they are placing the
*  blame on the Hamas-led government. And one way of reading that might be that this will weaken the
*  Hamas government. But I was looking back at other things you'd written, and you wrote this
*  piece for the Monkey Cage, which was a political science site at the Washington Post back in 2014,
*  co-wrote this piece, where you found that Hamas supporters tended to be in a better position
*  economically. And you suggested that, quote, instead of pressuring Hamas, a key effect of
*  the blockade has been to make life more difficult for opponents of the movement. And those who wish
*  to benefit economically are incentivized to remain tied to Hamas. Tell me a bit about that dynamic.
*  So, and we have evidence of that a little bit, Ezra, in this poll, which is that the poor folks,
*  the really disadvantaged people in Gaza, were most critical of Hamas. So it does lead us to believe
*  that there is this middle-class group of individuals that benefits from close ties with
*  Hamas, and they are invested in seeing that government stay in power. But we see that across
*  the Arab world as well. Ironically, the middle class, which is often sort of seen as the champion
*  of democratization or democratic movements, what we find is that this aspiring class of citizens
*  who believe that, okay, there's some aura of economic stability, therefore I am not going to
*  rock the boat. So on the surface, they're not staunch supporters of authoritarianism or for
*  Hamas or for terrorism. They just find it very beneficial to support a status quo government
*  that is okay for their economic livelihood. These are the people who sort of like will turn a blind
*  eye to the excesses of these regimes as long as their economic conditions are met. It's really
*  the poor disadvantaged citizens across these societies that end up having to bear the brunt
*  of public mismanagement and of a government that is not representing their interests.
*  How much does that turn them towards more radical alternatives? I mean, something I noticed in a
*  couple different polls was very high levels of support for the forming of armed groups like
*  Lion's Den and the Jinnin Battalion. There was a poll from the Washington Institute that found
*  high levels of support for Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is arguably more extreme than Hamas.
*  How much does the frustration with the PA and with Hamas turn people towards more radical movements?
*  These are questions that we sort of analyze all the time like who is more susceptible to
*  radicalization in general. And what we often find is that your average person who has limited upward
*  social mobility tends to sort of be more susceptible to the cause of radicalization. But also what we're
*  learning and what we're seeing in our polls is that people want alternatives to the status quo.
*  If you had an alternative in Gaza today that would say, oh, we're going to fight for the two
*  state solution, but yet that movement is living under blockade. That movement does not have any
*  partners to speak to. That movement has no world support. The average citizen is not going to find
*  that message very appealing. And so unfortunately, groups like then Islamic Jihad, who are more
*  extreme than Hamas, can basically say, and this is what they'll say in their mobilization, look,
*  the PA failed because it wanted peace. Hamas was in a ceasefire with Israel and it's compromised,
*  quote unquote. And then Islamic Jihad, well, yeah, we're like the true terrorists. Join us,
*  because there are no alternatives. I want to make sure that your listeners understand and appreciate
*  this. It is incumbent upon a global society to give people different alternatives to believe in
*  and that track well among their people. The fact that nobody can talk about a two state solution
*  in Gaza, even though we saw that there's support for it, it was before the attacks and before the
*  Israeli attacks on citizens. So this is not out of a moment of desperation. There is some
*  genuine support there. At least there is some support that you can tap into. But that message
*  of two state solution or a peaceful resolution does not track well because leaders and the
*  political process has failed. It's no longer seen as a very legitimate option as well.
*  One thing that alarmed me when I was preparing for this is that I think in America, we're used
*  to an age breakdown where younger people are more liberal, a bit more dovish, a bit more idealistic.
*  And in Israel and in Palestine, you see something different. These are much younger societies than
*  we are. The average age of Israelis is around 30. The average age of a Palestinian is around 20.
*  And young Palestinians appear more open to the formation of armed groups. The anti-judicial
*  reform movement has been older in Israel. The Israeli left skews older at this point.
*  And in surveys I've seen of Gaza and the West Bank, younger respondents seem to be more militaristic,
*  more fatalistic about the possibilities for a two-state solution than older Palestinians are.
*  So first, is that a correct rendering of the polling in your understanding of it?
*  And second, what do you make of it? So I do believe it's correct. You do see these more
*  extreme attitudes among youth populations on both the Israeli and Palestinian side.
*  The truth is, Ezra, at least if I'm correct, and there wasn't extensive polling back on the
*  eve of Oslo, that wasn't the case then. Then you had like groups like Seeds of Peace, you had ideas
*  about reconciliation. It was very common for the youth to talk about the advantages and the
*  possibilities and the dreams and the hopes linked to a two-state solution. So again, what we see
*  today in these polls is really a byproduct of a failed political process and failed leadership
*  on both sides that have pushed their publics to the extreme. So this has a very sad effect on
*  the youth on both sides. But also I want to bring in the role of social media. I look at some of
*  the things I'm seeing on TikTok and elsewhere, and the truth is it just pains me. It pains me as a
*  mother. It pains me as a citizen of the world. It pains me as somebody who still fundamentally
*  believes in a two-state solution that our children could be so ruthless to each other on both the
*  Israeli and the Palestinian side. It just pains me. It pains me, pains me, pains me. When our
*  children are ridiculing the death and suffering of the other side, somebody has done something
*  wrong. And I just hope that we look at this and we say that this is what the failure
*  of reconciliation and peace has brought. There is an active dehumanization campaign going on
*  on both ends, and it's just got to stop. When you look at Palestinian public opinion,
*  I can speak authoritatively on the Palestinian public opinion side of it, it also matters
*  what world leaders say. So when world leaders come around and basically dehumanize Palestinians
*  or legitimate the killing of women and children, or basically do not say anything about the humanity
*  behind these women and children being killed, that hardens their opinions about the peace process,
*  about the state of Israel, about the global community. This is also a population that is
*  desperate for international recognition of their humanity. And you saw this, you saw that Queen
*  Rania basically took to the airwaves with Christiane Amanpour on CNN. And basically her whole message
*  was, I want the West to remember that we, our people, are human beings. They are just human
*  beings. When any leader just simply says, you have to remember that Palestinians are also human,
*  we see changes in public opinion that are far more favorable. So again, Palestinians are
*  frustrated with the lack of humanization of their own children, their own lives, their own plights
*  in this conflict. Does that go the other way too? One thing I've heard from a lot of Israelis,
*  particularly over the last couple of weeks, although you hear it more often too, although I've heard it
*  before also, is that, yes, Israelis are seen as human in much of the West, but they fear that
*  any group that would elect Hamas does not see them as human, that their lives are beyond expendable.
*  And of course the attacks on October 7th seemed like final confirmation of that. I mean, they were
*  butchered. There's often an anger or a fear that they are not seen as human enough by Palestinians,
*  by others in the Arab world to live next to, to live alongside, and as such then they cannot feel
*  safe enough to do so. Is there anything owed to them too?
*  100%. I mean, of course Israelis also are very, are shaken by the core. I mean, what happened to
*  them on October 7th is atrocious. And like you said, they were butchered, they were massacred.
*  It is horrendous. But again, I want to just ask you, Ezra, I mean, the fact that immediately
*  it was well known that Israel was going to retaliate for this in Gaza, Palestinians were told to
*  evacuate and go south and north and east, and we don't know, right? Is it really for Israelis to
*  sit there and wait for the Gazans to talk about this Israeli suffering while they are now going to
*  be suffering as well? I mean, is that the litmus test? So I do believe that Israeli security and
*  the humanity and the dignity of Israeli citizens and the sanctity of Israeli and Jewish life in
*  Israel should not be based on what's happening in moments of war and devastation.
*  This is not the finest moment of the Palestinian-Israeli coexistence. Why? Because for 20
*  years extremists have led this conflict. There's a lot of hatred, a lot of pain, and right now
*  there's the world in the middle of the war. But in general, there is a lot of outrage in terms of
*  what happened in Israel. And so that is the common ground that peacemakers need to bring leaders
*  together to simultaneously condemn and stand with the citizens of Israel, but also stand with the
*  citizens of Gaza who had nothing to do with this. I mean, if Hamas is this organization that is
*  propped up by Iran or is a proxy of Iran, why are you holding accountable innocent children in Gaza
*  for that? Or not you, I'm not saying, why is the world? And so in the end of the day, the political
*  process has not brought our humanity together so that Palestinians can say to Israelis, we are
*  devastated about what happened. We are shocked, we are horrified for you, we will stand with you,
*  but what platform will allow for that exchange or for Israelis to step up? We're seeing this. We're
*  seeing Israelis protesting in Tel Aviv saying that they don't stand by what's happening in Gaza.
*  And that's a powerful point to end on. So then always our final question,
*  what are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  So I recommend a new book by Shibli Talhami, Michael Barnett, Mark Lynch, and Nathan Brown
*  on the one state reality. I also recommend a book by my colleague, I mentioned it, Khalil Shakaaki
*  and Shai Feldman that captures what I was trying to get at as in terms of the public opinion where
*  we see public opinion being softened towards each other and a two state solution. It's called
*  Arabs and Israelis, Conflict and Peacemaking in the Middle East. And for a good primer and a good
*  history of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, I recommend my colleague Mark Tesler's book,
*  A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.
