Video Description: Republicans want to label Kamala Harris as the border czar. And by just looking at a chart, you can see why. Border crossings were low when Donald Trump left office. But when President Biden is in the White House, they start shooting up and up — to numbers this country had never seen before, peaking in December 2023. Those numbers have fallen significantly since Biden issued tough new border policies. But that has still left Harris with a major vulnerability. Why didn’t the administration do more sooner? And why did border crossings skyrocket in the first place?


Harris was not the border czar; she had little power over policy. But to the extent that there is a border czar, it’s the secretary of homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas. So I wanted to have him on the show to explain what’s happened at the border the past few years — the record surge, the administration’s record and what it has revealed about our immigration system.

# The Real ‘Border Czar’ Defends the Biden-Harris Record
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXB0nwUAeKs)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  There's a reason that at the presidential debate, it was on a question about immigration
*  that Vice President Harris uncorked her bait about crowd sizes and crowd interest to try
*  to pull Donald Trump down the road to debate ruins.
*  Immigration is a tough topic for the Biden administration.
*  And you can see why on a chart.
*  The way that we measure the flow of migrants to the southern border is by tracking how
*  many encounters our officials there have with migrants.
*  If you look back to the Bush administration, you see actually fairly high numbers by modern
*  standards about, you know, times 150,000 a month, sometimes even higher than that.
*  Under Obama, it goes quite a bit down to often around 50,000, sometimes even less than that
*  a month.
*  Under Trump, it goes even lower than that.
*  Some very, very sharp lows, although one pretty big bump in the middle of 19, which then again
*  comes down and then after that the pandemic.
*  And then you hit Joe Biden.
*  And the chart just goes wild.
*  It just goes up and up and up.
*  It gets jagged, but we have numbers we've never seen before culminating in 300,000 encounters
*  in December of 2023.
*  Since then, the administration has worked with Mexico and other partners to increase
*  enforcement in those countries.
*  It has passed a series of executive actions on its own and it has brought those numbers
*  down.
*  But why didn't they do it earlier?
*  What led to the very high flows in the first place?
*  You often hear Republicans say that Vice President Harris was the border czar.
*  And she did get called that, although it was never an actual title and she never had any
*  actual power.
*  The portfolio she was given was root causes of migration in Latin America, which she did
*  not have any real power to affect.
*  She could not make Venezuela a non-filled state.
*  She cannot do all that much about gang violence in El Salvador.
*  She cannot change the economic disparities between America and some of these other countries
*  that lead people to make the dangerous journey here.
*  To the extent there's a border czar, or at least somebody with responsibility over the
*  border beyond Joe Biden, it is the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas.
*  And so I wanted to have him on to have a deeper conversation about why the flows under the
*  Biden administration have looked the way they have, what these new policies have meant,
*  what the border bill could have done, and how we should think about immigration going forward.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at NYTimes.com.
*  Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you so much for having me, Ezra.
*  So we had a surge, a significant surge in migrants at the southwestern border during
*  the first three years of the Biden administration.
*  We saw that peak at about 300,000 encounters last December.
*  The highest numbers ever recorded.
*  What made so many more people decide to take the dangerous journey to the United States
*  between 2021 and 2023?
*  So Ezra, I think we have to put that question in its historical context.
*  First and foremost, it is the post pandemic years, I should say the peak year of 2020.
*  And there was a tremendous pent up desire to leave the conditions in which people found
*  themselves.
*  Violence, financial insecurity, corruption, extreme weather events, totalitarian or authoritarian
*  regimes, the consistent drivers of displacement.
*  We've seen an unprecedented level of displacement around the world.
*  It's the greatest level of displacement since at least World War II.
*  And the United States came out of the COVID-19 pandemic year more rapidly than did other
*  countries in our hemisphere.
*  The economy recovered more rapidly.
*  So not only were the forces of displacement present and some unprecedented, but the attraction
*  of the United States was greatest.
*  Let me pick into that a little bit.
*  I take your point on the pandemic, though it really rises most sharply in 2023, not
*  2022 or even 2021.
*  But I've always found myself a little unsure how to take these arguments about hemispheric
*  instability and economics.
*  I'm not a Latin American history expert, but I know enough of it to know that if you look
*  over the past 50, 75 years, there are many points of really significant and far worse
*  poverty certainly, but of civil war, of murderous military juntas.
*  There's been a lot of instability that did not lead in those periods to this level of
*  migration to America.
*  So if it is the instability that is the cause, why is it so much worse now?
*  What is leading to instability making people more likely to migrate than what appears to
*  me to be similar levels of instability in the past?
*  Well, so I'm not exactly in agreement with the fact that it's the same level of instability.
*  And there's another force at play here, too.
*  And I'll get to that in a moment.
*  But let's take a look at two countries where the situation has changed.
*  The first being Ecuador.
*  Ecuador, historically, has not been a source country of migration, has not suffered such
*  a significant gang problem, has not suffered such a significant level of narco trafficking.
*  It was a transit country with respect to drugs, not a country of consumption.
*  That has changed dramatically.
*  President Naboa, early in his tenure, if not immediately upon entering office, declared
*  a state of war internal to Ecuador.
*  And we're seeing a level of migration from Ecuador that we never previously have experienced.
*  Then on the flip side, President Bukele in El Salvador imprisoned more than 70,000 suspected
*  or confirmed gang members.
*  The level of violence in El Salvador has plummeted and the level of migration has plummeted correspondingly.
*  In fact, some of the El Salvadorian diaspora have returned to El Salvador.
*  The other factor that is very different, if we look back as long as 50 years, as your
*  question supposes, is that we also have very organized, sophisticated smuggling organizations.
*  No longer do we have the solo coyote or the loose affiliation of people that are moving
*  others, but we have smuggling organizations that are true organizations and hierarchically
*  established and the like, and they're very sophisticated.
*  And they are using social media and online platforms to communicate to vulnerable people
*  and facilitating their transit.
*  And that is something that has grown exponentially, but it's certainly different than even 15,
*  12 years ago.
*  So I want to zoom in on that question of communication for a minute.
*  In preparation for this conversation, we spoke to a lot of people who are experts on one
*  dimension or another of immigration, and we ended up talking to them a lot about communication.
*  I had heard quite a bit before now about the rise of these transnational smuggling networks.
*  What I didn't understand or had no texture for was the degree to which they act as marketers.
*  It's not just that you go to them in desperation and pay them.
*  They are actually telling you when to go.
*  They are trying to drum up business.
*  You have to go now before the US does its policy change or before it stops having this
*  new policy that we're able to get you through on.
*  There's that.
*  And then there's also the rise of just telecommunications over WhatsApp, over messaging platforms of
*  all different kinds, where people have a lot more information flowing back and forth from
*  relatives who might already be settled in the US, from people who are making the journey
*  right now.
*  They see videos of them.
*  If you're interested, you can go look at TikToks.
*  Tell me a bit about how that has changed the availability of information, but then also
*  the ability to translate what might be a sort of incoit desire to migrate into a plan that
*  has architecture, that has people helping you, that has timing and all the rest of it.
*  Ezra, it is such an important point that you're focused on.
*  And let me say that when we speak of the dissemination of information more rapidly and more broadly
*  than ever before, we're not speaking exclusively of accurate information.
*  To the contrary, there is a tremendous level of disinformation that is being communicated.
*  And the most insidious and tragic example of that is the smugglers communicating false
*  information to intending migrants about the Darien, the land very difficult to traverse
*  between Colombia and Panama.
*  People are deceived into thinking that that journey will be quite facile.
*  Some smugglers style themselves as tour guides when in fact the journey is treacherous and
*  sometimes tragically fatal.
*  But the smugglers have a communication network on TikTok, WhatsApp, other platforms.
*  They reach individuals who are either intending to migrate or who are considering migration
*  and they reach them very effectively.
*  On the other hand, there are individuals here in the United States who are able to remain
*  in the United States during the pendency of their claims.
*  And because our system is so broken and those proceedings languish for between sometimes
*  seven and ten years, they are communicating to their relatives about their ability to
*  work the duration of their proceedings and it's attractive to others.
*  Let me hold on that for a minute.
*  So I grew up in Orange County, California.
*  When I grew up, there was a lot of talk of illegal immigration.
*  And the sort of thing people were talking about, which also fit with the sort of older
*  coyotes, more individual smugglers, was somebody trying to sneak undetected across the border.
*  That was a sort of modal idea of what illegal immigration looked like.
*  That's where you get Donald Trump coming up with a wall, right?
*  If people are physically moving across the border, create a physical barrier that stops
*  them from doing so.
*  That has changed dramatically.
*  And what people are doing is walking up to the border, getting caught on purpose or having
*  an encounter on purpose with a border patrol agent and claiming asylum and getting themselves
*  into this process, which is, as you say, is quite broken and leads to them often being
*  inside the US for five years, seven years, nine years with often work authorization.
*  Tell me what led to that shift?
*  How did we move from illegal immigration is sneaking in to illegal immigration, or at
*  least the kind of immigration people seem to be worried about as a policy question,
*  is presenting yourself in public?
*  The smugglers know the system very well.
*  They have the finger on the pulse.
*  And they're seeing an immigration court backlog only growing year over year.
*  They are seeing the duration of immigration enforcement actions extending longer and longer.
*  And they're able to coach intending migrants that there's not a need to evade law enforcement.
*  But to the contrary, one can approach law enforcement, make a claim of credible fear
*  that initial threshold in an immigration case have a high rate of success under the old
*  standards.
*  We have changed them.
*  And I know we'll get to that in our conversation.
*  But under the old standard, and this is a generalization because it varies according
*  of course, but as a general matter, maybe 70% of the population that claimed credible
*  fear had a successful claim.
*  But ultimately, 20, 25% make a successful claim of asylum at the ultimate merits hearing.
*  But that time in between the initial claim and the ultimate adjudication is many years.
*  And so that realization was marketed and is marketed.
*  So what you're saying in part, and this is interesting to me, is that the smuggler networks
*  may be the communication networks that once they realized the asylum system had broken,
*  had become overwhelmed, and created this possibility to be the United States for an extended period
*  of time before your case ever came up and as such as a much safer way to get here.
*  It was then able to spread that knowledge in a different way and at a different level,
*  which just makes the risk calculus somebody described illegal immigration to be as a mass
*  phenomenon made up of individual risk calculations.
*  It makes the individual risk calculation better.
*  Instead of you have to find your hole in the fence, so to speak, you have this way through.
*  But that it relies on the understanding of not just the American immigration policy system
*  at a high level, but a problem within it.
*  Was it not a problem when I was growing up, right?
*  When I was 12 in Orange County, was the asylum system not broken or was this just not understood
*  about it, such that it was a major factor in people's considerations to migrate?
*  I think that the problem has gotten worse.
*  The system is not built for a higher volume of people and so the pre-existing architecture
*  just continues to break and the backlogs continue to increase.
*  They increased in the prior administration and they have increased now, of course, until
*  this administration took certain actions.
*  The smuggling organizations have also changed the world of asylum writ large because when
*  I first encountered the system from a very, very different vantage point as a prosecutor
*  prosecuting smugglers in federal court, back then the smugglers didn't control the turf.
*  They certainly traversed it, but individuals fleeing their home countries, they would
*  get to the border wherever and however they could.
*  Now, however, the smugglers control the land.
*  The smugglers can control where and when individuals arrive.
*  And I think the lens through which we consider asylum law has to take that into account.
*  So you mentioned the actions the administration has undertaken to change this.
*  I'd like to sort of understand the before and after of this.
*  And so I was hoping you might walk me through what it would be like, what would happen when
*  a migrant comes and claims asylum in February of this year before the June executive actions.
*  And then now, if you came up and presented and said you had a credible fear of returning
*  to your home country, then what was the process and how has that changed?
*  So let's go back before this administration.
*  The status quo has been as follows.
*  An individual is encountered by the Border Patrol at the southern border and an individual
*  makes a claim for relief.
*  They claim persecution by reason of their membership in a particular social group.
*  And that has been an intentionally low bar to meet based on the principle that we would
*  not want to risk returning an individual to a place where indeed they are persecuted.
*  Given their cases pending and as the backlog has grown and grown, their essentially trial
*  date, if you will, the date on which they will make their ultimate merits claim is set
*  years and years away.
*  That was the status quo.
*  We took a number of measures.
*  We sought by way of regulation to empower asylum officers rather than immigration judges
*  that are burdened by overwhelming dockets to make the asylum adjudications.
*  The next thing that major measure that we took was we promulgated a regulation, the
*  circumvention of lawful pathways regulation that said that if one does not avail oneself
*  of the lawful pathways that we have built, there will be a presumption, albeit a rebuttable
*  one, but a presumption of ineligibility for asylum.
*  And we premised that on the fact that we had indeed built very significant, safe, lawful
*  and orderly pathways to reach the United States and access our humanitarian relief laws.
*  We built CBP One app, an app that allows people to make appointments at ports of entry and
*  come at a pre-approved time in an orderly and safe way.
*  We built a parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans that allowed as
*  many as 30,000 individuals from those four countries to be vetted in advance.
*  And if they have a sponsor in the United States to actually travel safely to the United States
*  via air.
*  And then we had the president's proclamation, which basically said that the border in between
*  the ports of entry is not the place to make an asylum claim.
*  The lawful pathways are.
*  And over time, we have built the capacity to process people far more rapidly.
*  We raised the standard for that initial threshold of credible fear.
*  We built the capability to return people to their countries of origin more rapidly.
*  And we changed to use your very correct framing.
*  We changed the risk calculus because if people think they have a 70% chance of success and
*  ability to stay in the United States for multiple years before their final adjudication, that
*  informs a risk calculus.
*  However, if one's chance of success is far, far lower, then the question arises in an
*  intending migrants mind.
*  Do I spend my life savings to pay the smugglers?
*  Do I risk my life on the dangerous journey in the hands of for profit, rapacious individuals,
*  ruthless individuals for a far lower likelihood of success?
*  The question is a very different one.
*  And we have found the answer to be a very different one as well.
*  Correct me if I'm wrong, because sometimes it's hard for me to keep what was in the bill
*  straight and not.
*  But wasn't there also a dimension of these executive actions that shut down the process
*  if encounters or claims on certain days were above certain levels basically created a shutoff
*  valve?
*  Yes, the president's proclamation does have numeric limits.
*  But shutting off is a bit of an overstatement because there are exceptions that account
*  for certain exigencies and acute humanitarian needs.
*  So if somebody, for example, is suffering a severe physical ailment that requires urgent
*  medical care, that is an exception.
*  But rather than focusing on the exception, what is the basic rule?
*  The basic rule says that the border is not the place to make an asylum claim.
*  The standard that one must meet has been heightened.
*  And I think correctly so as a matter of policy.
*  I actually think it's destabilizing not only for our country, not only for the intentions
*  of the asylum system, for the migrants themselves to set an initial standard that is so disparate
*  from the ultimate merits adjudication.
*  I just think it's a completely broken system.
*  And so we closed that gap by raising the standard.
*  And we also accelerated the adjudication process.
*  People are subject to expedited removal.
*  We try to conduct the adjudication while individuals are still in custody.
*  And so we stop the perpetuation of this broken architecture where people are able to stay,
*  even with an inadequate case, unsatisfactory case, where they're able to stay for years.
*  That's just a broken model.
*  So what has happened, as best we can tell, to the volume of migrants, the migrant flow, since June?
*  It has dropped dramatically.
*  The number of individuals encountered at the southern border has dropped more than 50%.
*  The current rate of encounter is lower than the rate of encounter at the same time as
*  in 2019, but we've seen a more than 50% drop in the number of encounters day to day.
*  Dramatic.
*  So I'll admit that this was somewhat surprising to me.
*  So I've been reporting on this back in February.
*  And when I was reporting on this and trying to understand what was happening at the border
*  more deeply, I was hearing a lot about these hemispheric conditions, right?
*  The economic instability, the gang rule, the government collapse in places like Venezuela.
*  And I understood the message of that to sort of be saying, this isn't really up to us.
*  How many people are coming to the border is not up to us.
*  It reflects conditions in other places and we can deal with it more or less humanely.
*  And then there was a bipartisan bill which failed, which we will talk about, and then
*  the June executive actions.
*  And the flow stopped, or at least seems to have halved or more than halved, pretty rapidly,
*  which is interesting because it implies that we actually do have through policy mechanisms
*  a fair amount of control over it.
*  That yes, there's a reality of conditions in other places and that might change the
*  level of motivation to migrate.
*  But migration is a risk calculation and the calculation is based on information that is
*  flowing back in all kinds of different ways about what's going to happen to you and what
*  your likelihood of success is when you get to the border.
*  And that if we change what we're doing at the border, people's decision to migrate or
*  not changes and that that is pretty sensitive to policy.
*  And in fact, if you do believe it's because of the executive actions, it's rapidly sensitive
*  to policy because the fall happened very, very quickly.
*  How do you think about that?
*  I think that that is partly true.
*  I do think the risk calculation is a correct framing, but it is not only our policies.
*  We certainly are now essentially delivering a consequence regime that is realized far
*  more rapidly than previously was the case.
*  And that is a material difference.
*  But that is not all that we have done.
*  And it's very important to place the president's proclamation, the executive action, our successful
*  implementation of it.
*  And I use the term successful because that's a very material term, because we were able
*  to implement it extremely rapidly.
*  And that credit goes to the men and women in the Department of Homeland Security.
*  But there are other legs of the stool, if you will, that are part of the equation.
*  One is the fact that we have indeed presented to intending migrants with asylum claims,
*  alternative means of accessing humanitarian relief in the United States.
*  And that's very important as well.
*  One can't look at the executive action in isolation.
*  One has to take a look at it in the context of a suite of efforts.
*  It is the executive action itself.
*  It is the lawful pathways that we have built, whether it's CBP-1, the Cuban-Haitian-Nicaraguan-Venezuelan
*  parole process, our family reunification processes with other populations, the safe mobility
*  offices, essentially triage centers that we have established in Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala,
*  Costa Rica, where people can come and make their claim for relief there, whether it be
*  a claim for urgent humanitarian relief, whether it be a claim of refugee status, whether it be
*  seeking to access our agricultural or non-agricultural unskilled labor visas under the
*  H-2A and H-2B program.
*  We have labor pathways not only to the United States, but to other countries, Canada and Spain.
*  I want to interrupt on this because I feel like you're trying to complicate this away from the
*  June actions. And I'm not saying these other actions were not important.
*  But as a policy guy from other areas, I tend to look at the timeline.
*  And a lot of things you're talking about happened much earlier.
*  And the drop, which is sharp and disjunctive inside the data, follows the more enforcement
*  oriented executive actions of June.
*  Okay. Let me give you another leg, though.
*  You cited at the beginning, you said 300,000 people in December of 2023, the highest on record.
*  The number plummeted in January.
*  What executive action did we take between December and January?
*  Well, I was going to ask you about this.
*  My understanding is this works in cooperation with Mexico and other transit countries.
*  So Ezra, the third leg of the stool is in fact our work with other countries in the region,
*  countries that have been countries of transit and working with them to ensure that they apply
*  their laws of humanitarian relief, as well as their laws of border enforcement.
*  And the December numbers in 2023 were so high because the Mexican enforcement agency,
*  Inami, ran out of funds.
*  And therefore there was no interdiction efforts on the Mexican side.
*  And President Biden engaged with President Lopez Obrador.
*  President Biden dispatched Secretary Blinken and me to Mexico.
*  President Lopez Obrador obtained new funding for Inami and the trains.
*  Now the conductors of the trains were accompanied by a member of the military
*  that prevented bribes from being paid, migrants from boarding trains and arriving quite fastly
*  at our southern border.
*  There were mirror patrols that were once again equipped to interdict individuals along the
*  migratory path.
*  And so the Mexicans were able to ramp up their enforcement and the numbers plummeted in January.
*  And so I adhere to the position that a policy action in isolation would not necessarily work,
*  though be of material impact.
*  And remember the risk calculus.
*  The risk calculus is not in a vacuum.
*  Should I or shouldn't I?
*  The migrants also say, you know what, should I or shouldn't I?
*  Place my life and my life savings in the hands of smugglers.
*  Or, and the disjunctive is important here, or am I willing to wait
*  and seek access to the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, Venezuelan parole program?
*  Am I willing to wait and take my chance at a safe mobility office?
*  And so it's not do I or don't I, but it's do I or don't I?
*  And if I don't, do I consider one of the alternatives that have been made available to me?
*  That perhaps previously were less attractive, but now have become more attractive because
*  of the executive action that has been taken.
*  In 2019 under Donald Trump, and I've asked people about that moment on the chart,
*  because you're looking at the time series here.
*  In 2019, it goes way up.
*  That's an incredible spike.
*  And they tell me basically that the cruelties of the family separation program had come to light,
*  that they sort of eased off because of that.
*  The smugglers took that as an opportunity.
*  But then the Trump administration turned around and threatened a bunch of countries
*  south of the border, primarily Mexico, but not only with very significant tariffs.
*  They didn't crack down on flow, which is what brought down the numbers again.
*  And then in 2023, my understanding is you guys did not go to our partners with tariffs
*  and tried to do it punitively.
*  But when it got very high, the significant first move for one of them was to try to rebuild
*  an integrated mechanism here.
*  So what keeps our partners in partnership with us?
*  What keeps them keeping their own enforcement regimes up?
*  What do they want?
*  How do you sort of not have a cycle where after it becomes a very big deal for us and we do
*  deal making, they pay attention to this for a bit, but then, you know, let up on it because
*  it's of less use to them.
*  What are the diplomatic dimensions of this?
*  So they are varied.
*  But let me cite two principles.
*  One, of course, is fundamental, which is the measures that we take must adhere to our values.
*  And I would respectfully and vigorously submit that that distinguishes us from many of the
*  measures that were taken in the prior administration that did not adhere to our values.
*  And the most notable example is one that you have referenced, the family separation policy,
*  the zero tolerance policy that actually called for the separation of children from their parents
*  for the express purpose of deterring other parents from migrating with their children
*  to the United States.
*  A horrific, indefensible policy.
*  With respect to the other countries, there's a reality here, which is that irregular migration
*  while the United States might be the destination of choice because in this administration,
*  our economy has rebounded and is prospering far more rapidly and to a far greater degree than
*  that of any other country in the region.
*  We are the ultimate choice of destination.
*  But the reality is that we're not the only one.
*  And the countries of transit realize and understand that they too are places of destination,
*  not perhaps the top choice, but a choice.
*  And so irregular migration strains Mexico as well because of people settling in Mexico.
*  It strains Costa Rica, Panama as well.
*  Colombia has regularized more than two million Venezuelans.
*  So it is a regional challenge that everyone understands requires a regional solution.
*  So you mentioned a second ago, the cruelty of many of President Trump's measures, so you
*  didn't necessarily identify the name.
*  And I agree with that.
*  But I do want to get your response to the thing I hear often from people who are, I would say,
*  more sensibly on the right of this issue, which is what they say when they look at the
*  data of migrant flows is that Donald Trump was in office.
*  He made very clear, both in policy, but also in word, in deed, in signal, that America
*  was unfriendly to migration in general, but illegal migration in particular.
*  And so fewer people came for the most part.
*  And when things spiked, he acted very, very quickly to lean on our partners and twist
*  our arms to bring that spike back down.
*  And then Democrats won in 2020.
*  Donald Trump's actions had pushed the party to be a much more pro-immigrant party than
*  it had been in the past.
*  The sort of rhetoric you would have heard from Bill Clinton was not how Democrats
*  sounded in 2020 about this.
*  The belief was that the Biden administration was a much more compassionate administration,
*  was rolling back some of what Donald Trump did.
*  And the migration number soared.
*  And that that itself was a kind of policy failure.
*  That it was not, in a weird way, more compassionate to be more compassionate because it created
*  this sort of chaotic situation that has pushed the politics of immigration in this country
*  quite far to the right.
*  Where what we are talking about now is not comprehensive immigration reform anymore.
*  It's how to kind of tighten the asylum system and better lock down the border.
*  How do you respond to that?
*  Well, I mean, first of all, it's difficult to not be more compassionate than the prior
*  administration.
*  We, as I said a moment ago, a principle of this administration's governance is that we
*  will adhere to our values.
*  And that is a fundamental principle.
*  It's foundational.
*  I don't believe that rhetoric was the draw to people.
*  We were in a period of recovery from COVID.
*  I spoke of the forces that led people to come to the United States.
*  The reality is if there is a magnet, if you will, to use that term, it's not a term I
*  like very much, but just for the sake of conversation, the greatest magnet is the
*  broken system that we have.
*  And this administration has taken actions to remedy that.
*  The challenge is that our remedies are not necessarily durable because they are
*  challenged in court.
*  And the enduring solution rests in the hands of Congress.
*  And so we are going to be more compassionate because we ascribe to and execute on our
*  values.
*  And we will not allow ourselves to be unmoored from them because to do so, I think,
*  threatens much more of our country's identity than how we handle irregular migration.
*  So by late 2023, the flow at the border is a crisis when I'm talking to members of the
*  Biden administration.
*  Nobody's saying it's a Fox News invention.
*  There is a real sense that the policy needs to be fixed.
*  You mentioned a second ago that the more durable solutions are not executive actions,
*  which is what you would end up doing subsequently, the legislation.
*  Negotiations begin again late 2023 in the Senate between Senator Lankford,
*  a Republican from Oklahoma, Senator Sinema from Arizona, and Senator Murphy from
*  Connecticut.
*  And the administration gets involved.
*  I believe you were quite involved yourself, particularly as the year went on.
*  When that compromise deal was finished, what was it able to do?
*  What would it have done?
*  What would it do if it passed today that you've not been able to do through executive
*  action?
*  Well, not only would that bipartisan legislation have achieved the outcomes that we are now
*  achieving through executive action, but it would have done much more.
*  And one primary thing it would have done, which would have been transformative, is
*  resource the immigration system that has been perennially underfunded.
*  It would have resourced us to have 1500 more enforcement agents.
*  It would have allowed us to hire over 4000 more asylum officers.
*  It would have funded the immigration court system with more immigration judges.
*  Just a remarkable shift in addressing some of the gaping shortcomings in the workings of our
*  country's immigration system, at least in the context of asylum and border enforcement.
*  Transformative changes.
*  So something I have heard from people who've worked on that bill is that the timing was off.
*  By the time it was locked, the 2024 election was in swing.
*  Donald Trump, and he deserves tremendous blame on this, called congressional allies and killed
*  the bill.
*  At the same time, the bill did not have to, or some deal here, some engagement here, did not
*  have to wait all the way until the end of 2023.
*  The problems at the border were evident well before then.
*  At the debate, David Meir asked the vice president a version of this, something I've
*  heard from border Democrats as well.
*  Why didn't the administration do something here sooner, try to build the deal here sooner,
*  or even do the executive actions sooner?
*  It could have been done in early 2023 and 2022.
*  I didn't quite hear her answer, so I wanted to pose the same question to you.
*  Why did it take until the final quarter, roughly, of 2023, and then after that,
*  Bill died until late, actually, in 2024, or June 2024, for the change in policy to happen here?
*  Why didn't you all do this sooner?
*  So let me break that down, if I may, Ezra.
*  Let's first talk about the negotiations.
*  The fact of the matter was that the senators were not lone actors acting untethered to
*  their respective colleagues, but were rather, and importantly, representative voices.
*  And those negotiations were difficult, and they were ultimately successful.
*  And because those senators had achieved significant compromise, but a really transformative
*  piece of legislation for the first time since 1996, we did not foresee that that bipartisan
*  negotiation that involved a great deal of compromise that delivered a solution for the
*  American people would actually be torpedoed, because some forces did not want a solution,
*  but rather would like the problem to persist for political purposes.
*  So that is first, let me just articulate that.
*  Then let me step back and speak about the timeline, because this administration was not
*  passive until those negotiations began.
*  Quite to the contrary, first, let's take a look at what was the reality at the border.
*  Please remember that until May of 2023, we were operating under the force of Title 42,
*  the public health order created by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the fact that people were subject
*  to expulsion under Title 42, an issue that was quite contested, frankly, by different
*  constituencies. So until May of 2023, we were subject to the Title 42 public health order.
*  In addition, and during that time, we did issue, we did promulgate the asylum officer rule,
*  empowering asylum officers to adjudicate cases. We did promulgate the circumvention of lawful
*  pathways rule immediately upon the end of the Title 42 order. People expected pandemonium,
*  and pandemonium did not result. And then we went to Congress and we sought additional funding
*  for the immigration system in a supplemental funding request. That did not succeed.
*  Once again, Congress failed to act. This administration went to Congress again,
*  and again sought supplemental funding. Congress failed to act, and we went shortly thereafter
*  into the negotiations for bipartisan legislation in the United States Senate. So we certainly
*  were not passive. Not only did we promulgate the regulations, we built the lawful pathways
*  that I referenced earlier. We built operational capacity that never previously existed,
*  the ability to remove or return people more rapidly. In one year, we've removed or returned
*  a greater number of people than in any year for, I don't recall the precise number, but certainly
*  stretching well into the prior administration. We've built operational capabilities on the
*  enforcement side that were unprecedented. And is your view that those capabilities were
*  necessary for what came later to work? Because I take your point. I'm not saying that you all were
*  seized by an action, but there's a force to what you did in June. Obviously, the cooperation with
*  partners that happened sort of more around December or the new year was very significant as well. And
*  there are a lot of Democrats. I mean, I speak to some of them who are governing in border states,
*  who say, you know, my life would be easier if they had done this earlier, if it was in their power
*  to tighten the border as they now have. And the flow is as responsive to that as it appears to
*  have been. We could have been here earlier and immigration wouldn't be such a tough issue for
*  me right now. A couple of things. Ezra, I don't want to minimize the impact of the executive action
*  that the president took in June. So please understand that it has had a material, a very
*  significant impact, but we cannot view that in isolation. And please remember that the executive
*  action is the subject of ongoing litigation. We actually have a hearing in that litigation
*  coming up. So the durability is subject to challenge. And it's also important to remember,
*  and this goes back to what we've been discussing, that the phenomenon of migration is by no means
*  static. So had we not had as robust an alternative in lawful pathways as we do now, having built
*  those safe mobility offices, seeing them now really deliver results for people from the countries
*  of origin, from the countries of challenge. We've exceeded the number of refugee admissions for this
*  region than ever before. Building the operational capacity. I don't know that the executive action
*  would necessarily have been as materially impactful had we done it earlier than we've done it now.
*  And to do the executive action at a time when Title 42 is in operation, it's very difficult
*  to take this action out of its temporal and operational context, place it in another point
*  in time and assume the exact same results would occur. I just don't think migration works that way.
*  I want to end here by zooming out a little bit to the immigration system as a whole.
*  The fact that Democrats and Republicans now agree that certainly the asylum system is broken,
*  it sort of obscures, I think, their disagreement. James Langford and Chris Murphy might have
*  now similar views on what you could do to tighten asylum, but in general, Republicans largely just
*  want less immigration. Certainly Donald Trump, I think, just wants to get as close to a closed
*  border as he possibly can. Democrats, I think, have a more complicated set of motivations here.
*  And the immigration system does a more complicated set of things. There's the part of it that is
*  humanitarian. There's a part of it that is treating immigration as a strategic resource for America,
*  a point of national competitiveness. We can get the best and brightest from the whole world here.
*  And then there's the question of us being able to decide who becomes an American and who comes into
*  our borders. How do you think about what the system should do from your perspective or from
*  the Biden administration's perspective? What is the point of America's immigration system as a whole,
*  or at least what should it be? I think its goals are actually well defined. We just don't achieve
*  its goals because the system has not been fixed to meet the times in which we live and how we have
*  developed as a country. The three goals are basically economic prosperity, family unification,
*  and humanitarian relief. And let's take, we've been talking about humanitarian relief in the
*  asylum system, which is a companion to the refugee system. They are distinct, but let's take a look
*  at economic prosperity. There is agreement, bipartisan agreement, that our economy benefits
*  from migrant labor. Take the non-agricultural, unskilled visa, the H-2B. Republican and Democratic
*  governors, senators, House members, implore me to deploy the maximum number of visas available.
*  And they all decry the fact that that maximum number is woefully inadequate to meet their
*  respective jurisdictions' needs. And that's because the numeric limits were set in 1996.
*  We're in 2024 now. If we look north to Canada, Ezra, Canada needed this year to fill its labor
*  needs. 700,000 jobs to be filled by migrant labor because those jobs could not be filled
*  by the domestic workforce. And so Canada decided to invite as many as a million migrant laborers
*  to Canada for the benefit of its economic prosperity. We're stuck in 1996.
*  Talent from all over the world comes to be educated in the United States. It's some of our best
*  colleges and universities. They develop skills that our companies need and desperately want.
*  The individuals themselves, the students now skilled, want to stay, and our immigration
*  system does not provide them with an avenue to do so. And we lose them to other countries
*  that end up competing with us. What a broken system. And it's broken in terms of all three
*  goals that underlie it. And when you say that we know what the goals are, we just haven't
*  just haven't rebuilt the system or updated the system to achieve them. I recognize this might be
*  a significant question, but what would it mean to update the system to achieve them? I mean,
*  my understanding of the immigration system as a policy architecture is that it has been some time
*  since it has had a fundamental overhaul. There were attempts under Obama, under George W. Bush.
*  What it has instead are a series of patches and updates and tweaks and emergency bits
*  layered and band-aided and grafted on. And so the whole thing has developed a somewhat unwieldy
*  dimension to it. To say nothing now over a series of administrations, the many, many
*  immigration-oriented executive orders. What would actually need to be done here if we know what we
*  need to do? It would be a very significant overhaul that touches all three goals. Look,
*  there are, of course, voices in our country that don't agree with those three goals. There are
*  voices that don't believe in immigration to the United States, that want to change the very
*  identity of this country in that regard. I think that would render our country far, far weaker
*  and far less valued in the world. But it requires an overhaul. I will tell you, I grew up in terms of
*  my federal government service of more than 20 years. I grew up in the Department of Justice
*  as a federal prosecutor. And the criminal codes had three goals, punishment, deterrence, and
*  rehabilitation. And certainly not all of those goals are always achieved. But one took a look
*  at the criminal code and it drove to those goals in a rather consistent way, if you will.
*  When I was introduced to the Immigration and Nationality Act as the Director of U.S. Citizenship
*  and Immigration Services, the statutes governing our immigration system, I saw to your correct
*  characterization patches and band-aids and bridges sometimes broken. One can see a provision
*  promulgated during one administration in tension with another statutory provision codified in a
*  different administration with a different outlook. And those two are in tension, if not in conflict
*  sometimes. It is a reality that an individual can be simultaneously eligible for deportation. We use
*  the word removal now. Simultaneously eligible for removal and naturalization. And when I came to U.S.
*  Citizenship and Immigration Services, the outcome that that individual encountered was dependent
*  upon which office was adjudicating the case. That is not functional. And there's what the system wants.
*  How do you understand what the public wants here? And two data points I'd be curious to hear you
*  reflect on. One is that we had a very low percentage, I think historically low percentage, of
*  the U.S. population being foreign-born in 1970. It's about 4.7 percent. By 2022, it was about 14 percent.
*  I've seen estimates for today that it's above 15 percent, which is levels last seen during the
*  late 1800s. Which I think explains some of why immigration has been so central to our politics
*  in recent years. It really has been in people's lifetimes. A very sharp increase in the proportion
*  of Americans who are foreign-born. But there's also these rapid swings in public opinion. So
*  when Joe Biden came into office, about a third of Americans wanted immigration to increase legal
*  levels here. About a third wanted to decrease. By June 2024, these are both Gallup polls, more than
*  half wanted legal levels to decrease while only about 16 percent wanted it to increase. It's a
*  very sharp swing against higher legal levels. How do you think about the both change in the
*  composition of the country, but also the sort of shifting public opinion around this issue
*  as you do your work? Ezra, I'd want to understand those numbers a little bit better and also
*  try to learn of the polled individual's understanding of what they're being asked and
*  what they're answering. Because I question whether they actually believe in a decrease
*  in the amount of legal immigration as distinguished from reacting to the situation at the southern
*  border. I do think that the public wants order and an orderly system that is functional. And that is
*  not exclusively the province of governance. It is critically also the province of legislation.
*  I think that is a good place to end. Always our final question. What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  Let me say this because that's a sweeping question. One of the books that I have read in the past two years,
*  that has impacted me considerably and that I consider to be absolutely exquisite in its writing
*  and in its power and in its message is The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead. That is one of the best books I've ever read.
*  What I have on my nightstand right now is motivated by the US Open. I have David Foster Wallace's String Theory
*  and the book that I have as its companion is The Dictionary. I have a book called The Dictionary.
*  Thank you very much.
