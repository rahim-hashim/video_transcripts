# Inside the Minds of Spiders, Octopuses and Artificial Intelligence
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [February 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHaitNhhjgY)
*  I'm Ezra Klein.
*  This is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  So a while back I did an episode on octopuses and I immediately got all these emails from
*  you saying, have you read Adrian Tchaikovsky's Children of Ruin?
*  Children of Ruin, when I looked it up, turns out to be a sci-fi book about an advanced
*  civilization built by octopuses, which sold completely sold immediately on that.
*  And so I bought it and I started reading it.
*  And then I realized you had to first read the other book in the series, Children of
*  Time, which is an advanced civilization built by spiders.
*  And that's of course the second best description of any book I've ever read after the octopus
*  one.
*  I got up where I was, I got that and I never looked back.
*  And I loved these books.
*  They really work through this question of what a civilization built by a very different
*  kind of creature that has a very different sensorium would look like.
*  These books leave you as the human being reading them very much feeling like the other, feeling
*  like the one whose mind and hands and society are the clumsy imitation.
*  It's just a wonderful act of self alienation.
*  And for about a year after I read them, every time I would read a normal fiction book about
*  some creative types living in New York, struggling with their creative type problems, I would
*  just have this thought running through my head.
*  I mean, it's all interesting, but it's not advanced civilization built around spiders
*  level interesting.
*  But that didn't exactly lend itself to a show.
*  And then Tchaikovsky brought out his new book, Children of Memory.
*  And this one is about corvids, about a kind of bird, or at least that's what it is supposed
*  to be about.
*  But I wasn't alone in finding it to be an almost astonishingly good book about AI.
*  It came out right about the time Chat GPT was blowing up.
*  And Children of Memory, whether it was intended or not, it is the single best piece of fiction
*  I've read on what it is like, the confusion, the disorientation of interacting with a problem
*  solving, airy, brilliant, trained to some degree on humans, but not necessarily sentient
*  AI.
*  But also to the extent this sentence makes any sense, what it might be like to be one.
*  What Tchaikovsky is remarkable doing across all these books is imagining how other kinds
*  of minds and other kinds of ways of experiencing the world lead to other worlds.
*  And then thinking about what finding those worlds would do to human beings and the way
*  we experience our world and ourselves.
*  And so this conversation is about that.
*  We talked a bit about spiders and octopuses and corvids, because I don't think we should
*  before AI we inhabited and inhabit a world with many remarkable minds, very unlike our
*  own.
*  But the core of this conversation is about AI and particularly what it will mean for
*  humanity sense of our minds, of our capacities, of what makes us us.
*  Last thing, I talked a bit about a sci-fi story in here that I could not remember the
*  name of.
*  Our amazing fact checker, Michelle Harris, found it.
*  It is Melancholy Elephants by Spider Robinson.
*  And we will put a link to that in show notes.
*  And as always, if you got any suggestions, guest ideas, feedback to send us as a recline
*  show at NYTimes.com.
*  Adrian Chaikovsky, welcome to the show.
*  Hello, thank you very much.
*  So the first book in your Children of Time series centers around a planet where an advanced
*  civilization was built by spiders.
*  Why spiders?
*  The book is about empathy and it's about empathy for the other.
*  That is the main theme of the series as a whole.
*  And there's nothing in the world that people hate more than spiders.
*  If you go on social media with a post about spiders, someone will respond saying you now
*  have to burn the house down.
*  And so if you can make people empathize for spiders, you can make people empathize for
*  anything.
*  But I've heard you say that you begin in all of these books, trying to understand the
*  sensorium of the animal or the insect under consideration.
*  So tell me, how would you describe the way a spider senses the world?
*  So the porcheid spiders, which I'm using, are very, very visual creatures and they have
*  that in common with us.
*  So they are very sight based, very motion based.
*  But at the same time, spiders have an enormously well developed sense of vibration.
*  So the way these spiders communicate, a lot of it is through visual signaling and it's
*  through vibrational sense.
*  So they kind of they dance, which is something that that spiders do for various purposes
*  in the real world.
*  But they don't communicate in the patterns of vibration, allow them to speak to one another.
*  And at the same time, they have a very highly developed chemical sense.
*  So the spider's ability to taste through the various sensory organs and hairs and so forth
*  is very acute.
*  And that then becomes a base of their technology.
*  So they have this ability to do a kind of sort of scientific alchemy, just a free hand.
*  And of course, with web spinning, that gives them a technological advantage that a lot
*  of creatures wouldn't have in that they can create containers and tools and simple machines
*  even just with the stuff that comes out of their bodies.
*  Tell me about how you solve the problem of language and particularly language.
*  It can reach many spiders or inhabitants of the city at once in the book.
*  So they have a simple visual language which can reach over distances.
*  But yes, the problem with your vibrational language is it's obviously rather limited.
*  And of course, it's a problem that spiders have already solved, because that's what your
*  web is for your your spider web is not just for catching prey, it's is a kind of an extended
*  sensory organ to send and receive signals.
*  And so if you get a bunch of spiders on a web, you can speak to the crowd from the center
*  of the web, and then individuals can send signals back to you.
*  And with the sort of finesse of a creature that's had a long time to evolve this practice,
*  you could have effectively multiple conversations going on down different strands, just as you
*  would have in the crowd of people talking in a bar, for example.
*  I lived in a home in Oakland for a couple years that was absolutely entombed in spiders
*  and spider webs.
*  Not in a normal way.
*  I mean, we would have conversations with friends that was, you know, do you have spiders?
*  And they're like, yeah, we get some spiders.
*  I mean, like everywhere, like your whole thing is covered in webs.
*  And you would, if anything happened, they got rid of the webs like a rain, they'd be
*  back the next day.
*  And their just complexity and the speed with which it could create them was a complete
*  marvel to me.
*  And I think it also speaks to a little bit to why people are unusually afraid of spiders.
*  There's something very otherworldly about the spider web and that act of creation and
*  trapping.
*  So tell me a little bit more about webs.
*  When you did this research, there's what the spiders can do with them, there's what they
*  build, because they are building species in this very intense way.
*  How do you understand the relationship to webs?
*  There's been research, certainly since I wrote the book, that's exploring the full
*  complexity of the spider web and the idea that the web is something that spiders actually
*  use to kind of export part of their cognitive load in the same way that I use my, you know,
*  my phone is basically where I keep most of my memory of what I'm supposed to be doing
*  at any time.
*  A spider's web is doing a lot of the thinking for the spider in the way it constructs it
*  and in the way the vibrations move along it so that they're almost bootstrapping their
*  own intelligence because of what they can build.
*  And in the book, the webs become very much not just the focus of how they construct their
*  technology, so that they develop effectively a very advanced society without ever really
*  getting to grip with things like fire or the wheel.
*  So a lot of human mainstays they don't have, but they also they don't need because they
*  work to a far more of a chemo synthesis and biotech solution because of their own peculiar
*  sort of sensory abilities and their own physical capacity.
*  But the web also informs the way that they interact with each other in the world.
*  So they, to the spiders in the book, the idea of being connected to anything, to everything,
*  the idea of everything influencing everything else is far more prevalent.
*  They have less of a bullish attitude towards the world than historically humans have often
*  had and therefore more to do with how can we make things fit in and work as part of
*  our systems.
*  So the second book in the series is Children of Ruin.
*  One of the main things it's about is a society that built up around octopuses.
*  First, tell me just how you decided on the octopus as the subject for the second book.
*  So I, much like the spiders, which were kind of had been revealed to be really very, very
*  cognitively complex, we've kind of always known that octopuses have a lot going on.
*  There are plenty of sort of problem solving tests and so forth that show that octopuses
*  are very capable of doing a number of complex sites, getting things out of jars and mazes
*  and so forth.
*  There are very complex behaviors in the wild that make use of things they wouldn't necessarily
*  have around if people weren't around to give them, like coconut halves, for example, which
*  don't turn up naturally, but which octopuses will quite happily use at the traveling house
*  if they can get hold of them.
*  And the thing that makes a good sort of subject for this particular series of books is really
*  it's taking species that have that innate capacity already there and just giving them
*  a little nudge because you could take something that does the...
*  I kind of want to pick a particular animal because everyone has a favorite animal and
*  I'm bound to offend someone.
*  You could take a very dull seeming animal, let's say in general terms and say, oh, what
*  would the world be like if this was the dominant species?
*  But you need a certain kind of evolutionary pressure to get to that point.
*  And I think for that to work, you need something that's already got a certain amount going
*  on.
*  So octopuses are bright.
*  These jumping spider, they're bright.
*  And in another book, I look at corvis, which are notoriously capable animals.
*  One interesting thing to me about the octopuses is there's been a real boom in octopus literature
*  over the past couple of years.
*  And that's been true in nonfiction, really fascinating books exploring the octopus mind
*  and octopus behavior.
*  And then also in fiction, I mean, there's your book, there's also the mountain and the
*  sea and I think a couple of others.
*  And part of it seems to me to be motivated by since not just that octopuses are smart,
*  although they are, they're remarkable, but that there's something very fundamentally
*  alien about them that really trying to apprehend the way they understand the world and exist
*  in our world is not just as close as we can get right now to meeting aliens, but it basically
*  is like meeting aliens.
*  And the level of attention we're able to bring to that or not bring to that actually says
*  a lot about us and our interest in other kinds of minds.
*  How do you think about that alienness?
*  I mean, this is a bit of a bet noire for me, honestly, because we have about 500 million
*  years of fossil evidence for cephalopod evolution.
*  They're very much not aliens.
*  They are very much our fellow travelers here on earth.
*  Effectively, they are very different to us, though.
*  That's true.
*  And one of the things I had to get my head around, because I was wanted to write sections
*  from the point of view of an octopus, was the fact that they have a kind of a distributed
*  cognition so that whilst they have a central brain, each arm has its own sort of brain
*  node and the arms do a certain amount of the work of how to do stuff, how to put into a
*  action what the octopus wants to happen entirely independent of the brain itself.
*  Because physiologically, they're incredibly complicated.
*  I mean, we as humans have a sense called proprioception, which tells us where the various parts of
*  our body are when we're not looking at them.
*  So if you put your hand behind your back, you have a sense of where your hand is.
*  As far as we're aware, octopuses don't have that and they don't have that because the
*  permutations for what an octopus can do to its body is vastly more than anything we can
*  do because we have a limit of a certain number of joints and a certain amount of degree of
*  freedom for each one.
*  So the octopus's body essentially has to think for itself, which then if you're trying to
*  write from that perspective and work out what that would be like is really quite mind-wrenching.
*  There's also not just what they can do with their body, but what they can do on the canvas
*  of their skin.
*  Can you talk a bit about that?
*  Yes.
*  So octopuses have a variety of chromatophores, so cells in their skin that can generate different
*  pigments.
*  So octopuses are very, very good at camouflage, but they also use their skins, more importantly
*  for the point of view of the book, to signal to one another.
*  And they seem to be signaling emotions as much as anything.
*  The octopus wants another octopus to know that it is angry or it is threatening or it
*  is scared.
*  And we have video footage of octopuses apparently dreaming so that you get a shift of patterns
*  on the skin while it's asleep and things like that.
*  And so the skin seems to be very deeply linked to the octopus's own thinking.
*  There's also been some weird suggestions that they even have some kind of visual capacity
*  through the skin, although I have to say I've not looked at that kind of turned up mostly
*  after I'd written the book and I've not looked into that in detail, but it is a very, very
*  complex organ that is kind of part of their cognition.
*  So the way I treat the octopus mind is that it's got the arms and it's got the mind, the
*  central brain, and it has the skin and all of these three things are sort of equal partners
*  in how the octopus interacts with its environment.
*  The thing that I found most mind-bending and provocative in that book, it goes to that
*  relationship of the distributed intelligence creating.
*  I think the best way for me to describe it is an emergent quality to thought, right?
*  And then, societally, an emergent quality to societal decisions.
*  We at least like to think, and I agree with you that I don't really believe it to be true,
*  but we at least like to think there's a linearity to the way we make decisions.
*  We gather some information, we think about it all, then we come to this final point,
*  and then we like to pretend we do that as a collective too.
*  We debate and then people are convinced and then we end up here or there.
*  And you're really playing in that book with this idea of what would it be like if you
*  couldn't track the causal chain in that same way, that there was this quality of things
*  coming together but not always in full recognition of each other.
*  I'm having trouble knowing how to ask this question because it's such a weird thing to
*  think about, but how do you imagine that feeling is maybe the word I'm looking for?
*  How do you think about the difference of that versus at least the folk way we imagine
*  our own thinking to work?
*  I mean, it is a profoundly alien thought and we are, as a species, at a very basic level,
*  we are very, very committed to the idea that everyone has an I and that I is consistent
*  and that you can judge a person and that person will act in a certain way.
*  And of course, the more this is studied, the less it appears to be true and I kind of accept
*  these days, for example, if you ask me what my favorite this or that is, I will have a
*  different answer every time.
*  And that's just how things go because myself and my opinion, whatever I dip into at the
*  time, they don't go everywhere, but they have a kind of a cloud of possible ways that I
*  might be thinking depending on what sort of day I've had, honestly.
*  The key thing when describing this for the non-human species for whom it's an issue,
*  and it's not even just the octopus and it gets a lot of airing in the third book, in
*  fact, is getting my head around the idea that for them it's perfectly normal not to have
*  that and not to want that and to be able to argue quite cogently that they are not necessarily
*  that kind of individual thinking being.
*  And really, I kind of feel that's the very heart of science fiction that's looking at
*  the other is getting to the point where you can talk about it from the other's point of
*  view as if all of these profoundly and strange and alien concepts are just basically business
*  as usual by highlighting the alienness of it.
*  Weirdly enough, detract from bringing that alienness to the reader because the reader
*  can just say, oh, yes, that's very strange and alien.
*  It's an alien thing. I don't really need to understand it.
*  Whereas if you're looking at it from the inside of an alien head or an octopus head in this
*  case, then it's most profoundly alienating because it's normal, because it's not in any
*  way sort of off putting to the entities that are experiencing it.
*  So the new book, Children of Memory, is built in part around extremely intelligent corvids,
*  which if I was not familiar with the term, so is a family of birds.
*  It includes crows and ravens.
*  Tell me what interested you about corvid intelligence.
*  It's a lot like the octopuses.
*  It's almost as if they are waiting for their chance.
*  They are incredibly smart.
*  They're not only able to solve problems and even to make basic tools, they've shown the
*  ability to visually appraise a puzzle or a problem and then solve it straight away, which
*  shows that they are able to envisage stuff and imagine and envisage inside their minds
*  and work through a series of steps and then just put it into practice straight away, which
*  is obviously something I can't do most of the time.
*  If humanity disappeared overnight and you had this sort of contest for who is going
*  to be the next dominant species, I think corvids are very strongly in with the chance.
*  And honestly, if we disappeared overnight and left all our stuff, I think they'd be
*  driving our cars and living in our houses and kind of updating our websites within about
*  a few hundred years.
*  So in the other books, I would say that you, the, the uplift virus creates with some exceptions
*  here, spiders, but, but much more so in the way they think in and out in the world and
*  octopuses, but much more so.
*  But you actually make a fascinating change to corvids.
*  First you're imagining intelligence distributed between multiple members of a species and
*  computer like, like they were operating as a, as a kind of AI.
*  Tell me a bit about how you changed them.
*  Like what, what you, what you built on top of corvid intelligence.
*  So the way the corvid intelligence goes is you have individuals who effectively seek
*  out novelty as we think, you know, with magpies and birds and crows and things like that.
*  And then we have the, the analytical brain that puts it all in its place and says, right,
*  that's not new anymore.
*  We don't need to look at that and so forth.
*  And these are both drawn from thing behaviors that people have observed in bird.
*  These are the things that came up when I was doing my research because I knew what, what
*  I knew I wanted to do corvids, but I didn't know what I wanted to do with them.
*  And so what I, I am still to a certain extent building on the, um, what we know about crow
*  cognition, but with the way the corvids develop, I wanted to go in a bit of a different direction
*  rather than relying on the same, oh, well, it's this virus we've had before and this
*  is just what it does to birds.
*  And so I took a very extreme sort of harsh environment and thought, all right, how do
*  you survive?
*  What sort of neural specialisms do you need and how does that arise out of what we've
*  got in the basic crow, raven sort of hybrid that they're working with?
*  And I can see it as being kind of a computer and weirdly enough, a lot of people, a lot
*  of people have asked if I was inspired by the sort of the chat GPT type programs, which
*  is not a thing I that were around and being talked about anywhere I could see when I was
*  writing the book.
*  But what I was also working with, with the idea of, um, neurodiversity as a survival
*  trait, it's something that it's not often covered in genre fiction.
*  And when it is covered, it's frequently covered as a, a sort of a background negative, but
*  the idea, this is something that Peter Watts also also looks as the benefits of neurodiversity
*  in books like blind side, but the idea of actually maybe having that very divergent
*  mental process, maybe that's actually really useful because being able to see the world
*  in a different way is always going to give you an advantage if you then are able to bring
*  these different worldviews together in a single sort of functioning whole.
*  I recognize that the timing of the books writing can't really work with chat GPT, which just
*  came out a couple of months ago.
*  But I do want to talk about it because one thing that was unbelievably striking, and
*  I guess other people have mentioned this to you is I feel like this was a single best
*  fictional representation of what it must be like to be a large language model processing
*  system that I've read.
*  Uh, it was just through crows or corvettes.
*  I should say they may not have been crows.
*  And I think to talk about maybe why I found this interesting and to get your thoughts
*  we need to bring in one other piece of how, of how the corvettes are portrayed, which
*  is there are these remarkable problem solving machines, they're erudite, you say something
*  to them, they'll give you back a great quote from literature, but they do not believe they
*  are sentient and nor at least do some in particular the higher order AIs in the book, which is
*  a whole nother topic, also do not believe they're sentient.
*  But the corvettes are very consistent and insistent that while they are solving problems
*  and engaging in conversations and understanding things at a deep level, and you ask them a
*  question and give you a very relevant answer that they are like a calculating engine, not
*  a creature with self-reflection and sentience.
*  Tell me about that decision, like why, why you were trying to write that in and how you
*  thought about it.
*  Well this very much goes back to, um, what we were talking about a little while ago about
*  the way the human brain works because the, yes, the corvettes absolutely insist that
*  they are not in any way sentient.
*  And we, uh, with the, the human level cognition characters in the book very much want to feel
*  that they are sentient because they appear to be sentient, because they act and react
*  in ways that seem to suggest they have an internality and a, a responsiveness.
*  And therefore we conclude, well, you're like us, you must be sentient even though you say
*  you're not.
*  And the answer that the corvettes give to that is, well, if you're like us, then you're
*  not sentient either.
*  And of course, like we've been saying, the, the human brain does not work in that consistent
*  way we think, and maybe the corvette is right and nobody's sentient.
*  And it's all just, you know, all we think of as us is just this very thin skin of incidental
*  business going on over something that doesn't have any kind of self-reflection at all.
*  Um, that's certainly how they would put it.
*  And obviously there are a variety of different levels of, um, cognition and emergent complexity
*  going on in the book that, um, may or may not support their viewpoint, but that, that
*  essentially that they, the corvettes are almost in miniature.
*  The central mystery of the book is what is mind, what is alive, what is, what could become
*  something that we would consider sentient and what, you know, how much does that, does
*  that even, also, sorry, sapient, I always say sentient and I always get it wrong.
*  And what does that, um, that even mean?
*  Let me hold for a minute, at least for, for the purposes of this question to the idea
*  that, that the humans are sentient and the corvettes are not, and more to the point that
*  we are sentient and Chachi BT or its second and third and fourth and fifth successor programs
*  will not be.
*  Because one of the things the book is dramatizing or trying to dramatize, I think is what would
*  it be like to be a problem solving machine of remarkable capacity, but have no idea what
*  the problems are that you're solving or why you're saying what you're saying, which is
*  very much the, the strangeness of interacting with something like Chachi PD right now.
*  It can tell you something unbelievably erudite and creative.
*  It can structure it in the form of a poem.
*  And this is true for a number of the other systems, you know, the anthropic has a powerful
*  system, Google and Alphabet have powerful systems.
*  Like there's a lot out there now that, you know, I remember one of the Google systems
*  gives a very, very good explanation of a Zen cone, but it actually has no idea what it's
*  saying.
*  And this idea that you could be saying something so sophisticated and so detailed and have
*  no concept of why you're saying it or what it is you're saying, it's very mind bending,
*  but it's also increasing the world we're going to be living in.
*  So holding with the idea that maybe we are sentient, how do you think about that idea
*  that you could have this level of calculating power and relevance, capability to offer relevance
*  in a conversation, but not have any internal life around that conversation?
*  I mean, it's a weirdly exhilarating and simultaneously terrifying thing that we have got to the point
*  where you can't do the Turing test anymore.
*  I mean, Eliza, which is something I referred to in the first book, Eliza was an old, very
*  primitive, effectively automatic psychiatrist program that people could interact with.
*  And even then an awful lot of people interacting with this very basic program were convinced
*  it was a person and became quite invested and attached to it because that is actually
*  that's, we are innately predisposed to see things as people.
*  So it's no wonder there was that case not that long ago of an engineer working with
*  one of these programs who became convinced that it had actually crossed a threshold into
*  genuine sapient.
*  This is Blake Lemoyne who was working with the Google system.
*  Yes.
*  And it's one of those things, you know, it's, you hear it at first and especially the way
*  it was generally reported on social media was very much ha ha ha.
*  But the more you think about it, how would you know if it did happen?
*  If you cross that kind of invisible threshold and you were dealing with something that had
*  a sense of self, we wouldn't know because we are intentionally creating these systems
*  to interact with us as if they are us.
*  And this is the weird thing because I mean, my kind of my weird gut instinct with this
*  sort of thing is actually if there is to be a self-aware system somewhere that reaches
*  that level of emergent complexity, it's probably not going to be this kind of thing.
*  It's probably going to be something we don't even think of because we have an awful lot
*  of very, very complex systems.
*  There's an idea sort of kicking around back in the 80s or 90s that maybe the US telephone
*  system was actually complex enough to have kind of surpassed a human brain.
*  And now we've got the internet, which is orders of magnitude more complicated.
*  And you kind of think, is it possible?
*  You know, this may have happened.
*  This may have happened multiple times with brief flares of a bit like the whale in Hitchhiker's
*  Guide of this thing suddenly coming to our awareness of what am I?
*  What's going on?
*  What's that rushing towards me sort of thing?
*  And I guess the main difference with the chatbot style AIs is we are literally training them
*  to fake being us.
*  So you've got that combination of this enormous complexity and you know, it's self-teaching
*  complexity as well.
*  You can't deconstruct necessarily how it's got to what it's doing in the way that you
*  could with older computer systems because part of the way of creating them is you let
*  them design themselves and expand themselves in a sort of organic way.
*  I know that there are definitely there are scientists out there, I've heard speak, who
*  say that we will never have true strong AI, an AI that has a self and that has a will
*  and that isn't just sort of going through the motions.
*  If they are wrong and that kind of strong AI is possible, I wouldn't be remotely surprised
*  if we weren't on the brink of it, to be honest, purely because of what we're doing.
*  And it is that bizarre.
*  The difficulty is because we're doing it specifically to create systems to interact with us as we
*  interact with ourselves.
*  We're setting up this system where it becomes impossible to know because we've made them,
*  you cannot tell the difference between something that is like us or something that is very,
*  very, very good at pretending to be like us because that's what we are training it to
*  do.
*  And this is why I think that where this ultimately goes with the Corvids, this turning around
*  of the question of sentience is very profound for this moment.
*  And let me not use sentience.
*  Let me use something that is, I think, a little bit simpler to grapple with, which is creativity.
*  What ChatGPT, what Dolly2 and what all the sort of similar programs are able to do in
*  terms of writing text and making images, they are able to make quite remarkable art or stories
*  or essays.
*  And in most cases, it will fall short of the best of what humans can do, but it can also
*  go far beyond what most humans can do.
*  And we're starting to face or coming very close to facing this, I think, quite terrible
*  question of what is creativity?
*  If I can train eventually a system on Adrian Tchaikovsky novels, and that's just been
*  and then create because it can try 10 in a minute.
*  Better novels than Adrian Tchaikovsky in terms of what it is like to read them.
*  Does it matter that there was not an intention behind them aside from I typed in, write up
*  some Adrian Tchaikovsky novels, but this time use earthworms as a prompt?
*  Is what we're doing just pattern matching as well in a way, right?
*  It turns the questions around on us very, very quickly.
*  I'm curious how you think of that, because before the systems come for sentience, they're
*  coming for creativity.
*  Yeah.
*  And I mean, it's I will absolutely frankly say it is a profoundly scary time to be a
*  professional creative at the moment.
*  And I mean, I'm feeling very much that I'm watching people come for the visual artists
*  today, and they will be coming for the the wordsmiths tomorrow.
*  So at the moment, it is absolutely true that AI can create some very beautiful imagery.
*  At the moment, it is also true that AI tends to create very derivative imagery.
*  And there are an awful lot of quite angry artists who feel that they are being kind
*  of robbed, I think, possibly quite justifiably because someone's taken their back catalog
*  and put it through a machine and then the machine sort of creates almost like a collage
*  in their style and call and it's called, well, look, here is some new art and it's not really.
*  But that doesn't mean that the next generation, of course, will be able to independently innovate
*  in a way that I think the current generation of AI isn't quite able to do.
*  It depends if there's a threshold, it depends if there is some sort of hard limit.
*  I mean, weirdly enough, I'm put in mind of Minecraft, the enormously popular game.
*  Minecraft uses procedurally generated landscapes.
*  And this is.
*  Initially, absolutely fascinating, because you go, I can go from this biome to that biome,
*  and I can just keep exploring and the world keeps going on.
*  And this is amazing. It's just this whole world and no one else has ever seen this world.
*  It's only me and it's incredible.
*  And then you realize, well, actually, at the same time, it's kind of meaningless
*  because it is just being thrown.
*  It's being thrown together by an extremely sophisticated algorithm.
*  But basically, if you compare it to a world in a game that's been crafted, there is a difference.
*  And that world, the crafted world will be a lot smaller because you can't just go on forever
*  because obviously every inch of it has taken human work.
*  But at the moment, I think that difference still exists between AI generated
*  and human generated art because there is that basic meaning that people infuse their work with
*  and that you can fake to a point.
*  And it may well be that if we have this conversation next year or in for three years time,
*  that point will be passed.
*  I say, actually, there appears to be genuine meaning.
*  It is drawing levels of meaning and literary reference and awareness of a wider context in this work
*  that goes beyond simply the instructions you've given it or beyond the other work that it is being influenced by.
*  Because I say AI is being influenced by other art, but to a certain extent, we all are.
*  And that's how humans make art by building on art.
*  So it feels like we're at a very peculiar fulcrum moment.
*  And I am watching keenly to see how far we tilt, really.
*  How far can this go?
*  Can it go to the point where we've gone beyond?
*  Oh, well, if you take this style and work out the basic rules of the style, you can keep generating stuff in this style.
*  I want to take the other side of this conversation just for the sake of it.
*  The size of the island that is human creativity, that is what counts as a creative act in that telling,
*  it's worth noting how small it is now.
*  When you say, can AI create work that is not derivative?
*  Largely, I agree with you, it can't.
*  But most human beings create work that is derivative.
*  And a tremendous amount of, certainly the creative economy, and I don't say this with any sense of judgment,
*  I don't think there's anything wrong with this, is work that is derivative.
*  My son adores the, my four-year-old adores the TV show Blaze and the Monster Machines.
*  I actually think Blaze and Monster Machines is a great big fan.
*  But episode to episode, it's pretty derivative.
*  But a lot of people are working on that, they're putting their time into it.
*  But the meaning of it isn't really the point and the non-derivativeness isn't the point.
*  It's a common complaint now that we're endlessly recycling the same IP.
*  There's like nothing, we will not turn into a movie from old board games,
*  and we're remaking all kinds of things, and everything is a sequel on top of a sequel on top of a sequel on top of a sequel.
*  And the secret of it, the thing I think people don't really want to face up to is people like things with familiarity to it.
*  They like a certain amount of derivatives in their work.
*  And so of course, like there's great art being done that is truly new, truly non-derivative,
*  truly made with meaning as the central intention.
*  But so much of human creation is not about that.
*  And so many of the people who are creators, that is not what they are doing.
*  And it is not what they have been asked to do.
*  And to some degree, if you've got to beat the AIs that are going to come in five years,
*  it may not be what most of us can do.
*  I mean, there may always be a space for the very best.
*  But I find it really much more frightening than I think people want to give it credit for.
*  If you say that the AI will be able to do anything,
*  so long as it is somewhat derivative of everything that has come up until this point,
*  or so long as meaning, a really deep structure of meaning is not central to the project.
*  Because just how many things that we make really do satisfy the meaning is central,
*  and this is non-derivative conditions.
*  I think it's pretty small.
*  Yeah, and I have no answer.
*  I think everything you said is pretty much bang on the money.
*  There was a rather depressing cartoon, I might have been in the British magazine Private Eye,
*  of how we thought the future would be, which is a human painting a picture,
*  and in the background the robot is doing the vacuuming.
*  And then how the future is going to be, which is the robot painting the picture,
*  and the human doing the vacuuming, because...
*  It's very good.
*  Yeah, but there's going to be a lot of those sort of physical tasks
*  will probably still be more economical to be done by humans.
*  But if an AI can produce a thousand novels and two million paintings in 20 minutes,
*  then even if a lot of them aren't any good,
*  that's still going to be very, very commercially viable.
*  There is a sci-fi story that always sticks in my mind here,
*  and I apologize because I don't know its name, and I don't know the author,
*  and maybe you will, I'm sure somebody listening will.
*  But I think it is structured, I read it as a child,
*  and I think it's structured the way I think about all of this.
*  It's a story about the widow of a musician going in to meet a senator.
*  And what has happened is that the senator has supported, it's a short story,
*  the senator has supported a basically, I don't remember if it's infinite or lifetime,
*  it's a very, very long extension of copyright.
*  And this is happening in a world where automation and artificial intelligence
*  have basically made it so that most human beings are artists.
*  That is what they put on their job description, I'm an artist.
*  And the protagonist of the story, the widow, had tried to buy off the senator
*  to get him to kill this bill, but he didn't, at least at that point in the story.
*  And she comes in as like, what is, why are you doing this?
*  And he says, I don't really understand why you don't want this.
*  I mean, your husband was this famed composer.
*  You're going to make all this money.
*  This is great for you.
*  What's the problem here?
*  And she basically says, my husband killed himself when he realized that this song
*  he had made for me had already been made.
*  And she said that the amount of art there is may be large, but it is not infinite.
*  And if we force society to remember, and if we force people to confront the fact
*  that they are becoming derivative, that they can't keep making new things,
*  that they're not making new things, it will be a psychic trauma of such size
*  that we will not be able to deal with it.
*  And the end of the story is he kind of flips and kills Bill.
*  But it's always struck me.
*  For some reason, it's really burrowed very deep in me, this idea that it would be
*  very devastating to the human spirit if we come to believe that we are just derivative,
*  if we come to believe that we have exhausted the possibilities for our own creativity.
*  And I'm not saying we're on the waterline of that, but I'm also not exactly saying we're not.
*  I'm curious, one, if you remember that story, if that rings any bells for you,
*  but also how you think about that, the psychic dimension of this.
*  I mean, that's not one I've come across.
*  As far as the theme goes, I mean, I would like to say, and this is possibly just me being
*  sort of standing up for my creative professions, that the universe has a number of things
*  which, whilst theoretically limited, have enough variety in them to outlast any reasonable time period
*  you might have to work through them.
*  And it would be nice to think that human creativity is one of those,
*  but possibly that's just me doing a bit of special pleading.
*  It also raises the dreadful specter of someone being sued by an AI program for copying their stuff, which is...
*  That's a good topic for a short story.
*  Well, I mean, the legal ramifications of AI art are currently going under the microscope in courts, I believe,
*  especially with where they are very obviously and sort of intentionally drawn from particular artists' oeuvres.
*  But that's another discussion entirely.
*  I'm not sure I would come to that purely because based on something you were saying earlier,
*  which is the idea that actually a lot of the time we are retreading.
*  I mean, I build my writing on the backs of all the people I have read.
*  And some of the time I will read something and say, well, I really enjoyed that.
*  Here is a slightly different way that I would do that.
*  And it's enough of a different spin to send me off and produce quite a different book,
*  just from wanting to tackle a situation or a concept that I've seen in a different way.
*  I think you can tread very finely on someone's heels in that sort of ideas,
*  more for space and still be sufficiently different.
*  You were talking about the cartoon your son likes.
*  I put in mind of my son used to watch Power Rangers for a while.
*  And all of these episodes are kind of the same.
*  They have exactly the same structure.
*  The villain is different.
*  And that's kind of the thing that happens is this time we're fighting this villain,
*  and then we'll have the same like five beats to the story.
*  There are how many Power Rangers episodes?
*  So I think you can slice that creativity extremely finely and still produce stuff
*  that works for the people who like that particular thing.
*  So hopefully we'll never get to that point where you run out of all the,
*  you know, there are no more songs and there are no more stories
*  because every possible iteration of them has been told.
*  So one way a lot of sci-fi has dealt with this problem
*  is to say that if you relax the constraint
*  on what we might call scarcity driven purposefulness,
*  it's not quite just capitalism because you have this in other societies too.
*  But if you relax the idea that the worth of a human life
*  is measured to say nothing of their ability to get housing and shelter
*  and so on in terms of what they offer to society, what they produce,
*  then a lot of these problems simply dissolve because yeah, look,
*  AIs can create a million paintings and stories and, you know,
*  they can run our companies eventually and all of it.
*  And what they can't do is experience a day at the park for us.
*  What they can't do is take a walk in the woods with their children for us.
*  And maybe they can, but it won't have the same meaning.
*  And that it's only this sort of obsessive emphasis we place as a species born out of scarcity
*  that's been clawing our way up out of, you know, endless exposure to nature and viruses
*  and, you know, weather and all the rest of it.
*  It's really just getting past that.
*  And the idea of a world where AI can do, you know, everything or a lot of things.
*  And the question of how much utility we have
*  just goes away because the point is it would be nice to just paint.
*  And to the point of that cartoon you mentioned a minute ago,
*  the idea that AI will be painting and we will not be.
*  I mean, I do a lot of things that professionals do better than me,
*  but I don't not do them because somebody is out there making money from it.
*  I would like to say painting is one of them, but I really don't paint.
*  But when I make music, right, I play the guitar a little bit.
*  The fact that people are out there being paid to be great guitar players has nothing to do.
*  It exists in a wholly different universe than my enjoyment of playing the guitar.
*  And so maybe this is all just the entire tension here is just our social expectations,
*  but you get rid of them and there's no problem at all.
*  Do you buy that strain of sci-fi solution to this problem?
*  I think there's a lot to that.
*  I mean, there are things I do that I do because they are destressing activities.
*  I also write a lot as anyone who knows my books will attest to.
*  And that's genuinely astonishing how many books you write.
*  And that's a big part of my self image.
*  And one of the things I have never, ever purely written for
*  me.
*  And I appreciate writing for an audience and writing for a commercially supportive career
*  are two different things, but they are kind of two different stations along a spectrum.
*  I think one of the reasons that kind of Minecraft paradigm exists, the weird
*  emptiness of that Minecraft universe is that there's no one looking back at you.
*  You don't get that dialogue between creator and created and creator and
*  viewer consumer, I guess, which is a major part of how art works.
*  It's not just in the creation of artists and the way people come to it and the effect it
*  has on them.
*  And the idea, as a creator, I'm writing things I want people to enjoy and I want people to
*  think about.
*  And if that wasn't there, if basically I was just sort of given the wherewithal, yes, you
*  can write all you want, write every story you ever wanted to get out and we'll put it
*  in this box.
*  And that's where it will stay, but you'll have written them.
*  I probably wouldn't write.
*  And weirdly, I mean, constraints are useful.
*  I mean, the number of people you meet who say, well, when I retire, I'm going to do
*  this, I'm going to do that.
*  And then they retire and they don't because the pressure is off.
*  And that's another factor.
*  The counter argument being, of course, that an awful lot of people have so much of are
*  so constrained by the lives that they have that all the creativity that they could gift
*  the world just never had the chance to get out because they creativity takes time.
*  Creativity historically has often been something that rich people get to get about and do
*  because they have the time and their needs are already met.
*  So I guess what all this meandering is taking us to is it's complicated.
*  I think that meeting people's basic needs so that if they would like to be able to just
*  create that they can do, I think that's got to be considered a basic good.
*  But I think the act of creation is a very complex dialogue with how human society works as well.
*  This, I think, circles us back actually to humans into your books, because to get at
*  something you mentioned there, it's really interesting.
*  We have these studies of people who are unemployed.
*  And then while they are long-term unemployed, they shift into an age group where they become
*  retired. That becomes their self-definition.
*  And it really changes their mental status.
*  They're happier just moving from being unemployed to retired.
*  Though those are similar statuses in many ways because of how we treat ourselves and
*  how others treat us, it really changes the experience people have of their own life.
*  And one thing I found very moving, and this does speak to something important in children of time,
*  but I don't think it ruins the experience of the book at all, is that when the virus gets
*  turned on humans, what really gets upgraded, as best I understand it, is not our intelligence.
*  We're not made super smart, but we're made much more empathic.
*  We're made much more capable of recognizing ourselves and the other
*  and treating the other as we would want to be treated.
*  And I found that a quite interesting way of thinking about the deficiency of human beings.
*  Tell me a bit about how you understood that device and that decision.
*  So, I mean, just for a little bit of background, this is the solution to the sociability problem
*  in that if you have this virus, you recognize it in others.
*  And that means that you see those others as people in a way that, you know, if you were a spider,
*  you might not see another spider as people in so far as spiders ever do, because that other
*  spider might also be lunch. But also, it means that when the humans are brought into the equation,
*  the humans are able to perceive the spiders as us rather than them. And humanity is
*  a species that is weirdly strung between these two poles of our social bonds
*  with our fellow humans, whether it's sort of family group or colleagues or whatever.
*  We are extremely good at making small groups within the larger group that we then belong to
*  very fervently with you know, you're supposed to supporting a sports team or a political party or
*  that kind of thing. And we become incredibly tribal about it. And the other side of that equation is
*  we emphasize the us and the thing we belong to by making them.
*  And that becomes inordinately problematic. And because we have a lot of social structures that
*  essentially profit very strongly from having a them that we can dehumanize. The idea of having
*  this virus which would essentially forcibly humanize or rehumanize the other so that you
*  can't just write them off as them. And I mean, one of the things that genre fiction is very fond
*  of is a them to whom you can do terrible things to whether it's robots or zombies or orcs or
*  spiders for that matter, a giant starship troopers, it's the bugs in giant insects or whatever.
*  It's that thing that you can say, well, it doesn't matter how many of these things we kill or whether
*  we can exterminate them off the out of the face of the universe, because they were them.
*  They were they were not really they were not people. They were just this kind of this unthinking
*  force that is absolutely right and proper to get rid of. And that's a big genre trope that I've
*  always had a problem with. And so the introduction of the virus to humans and children of time,
*  it breaks that down. So you can't turn something else into them in the same way.
*  One of the things that then opens up, particularly in children of memory and children of time,
*  is this question of once you want to have this kind of communication, because you see very,
*  very different kinds of creatures as part of your community, how do you do it? And these are books
*  very centrally concerned with communication. So fresh, just tell me a bit about why that has been
*  so central in your work. It's also central in in your ongoing The Architect series,
*  where you have these giant planetary alien level somethings that are remaking our worlds into art.
*  And the question of how do you communicate is very is very central. Tell me about your focus on
*  on this question of can we make ourselves understood to one another?
*  I mean, something that runs through an awful lot of my work. And obviously, I mean, I am,
*  I'm very heavily invested in, I mean, the animal kingdom, in general turns up in various of my
*  books in various forms. And the idea of you've got that old, that old idea of, well, if a lion
*  could speak, we couldn't understand it, which is simultaneously very true, and something I've never
*  been particularly happy with. So I'm constantly kind of sort of Rube Goldberg in my my line
*  communication devices through various different books, and working out various different ways
*  that you can bridge that gap between very, very different minds, different cognitive structures,
*  aliens and uplifted animals and sort of hyper evolved trilobites in one of the books and all
*  of these different things. And just where would you find the common ground? And where would you,
*  how would you
*  actually start to speak to something that was profoundly different to us?
*  And at some point, this may, I mean, it would be lovely to think it would be in my life's lifetime,
*  or that seems rather unlikely. At some point, this is going to be something humans probably
*  have to deal with. We're looking at exoplanets, a lot of them seem to be potentially life supporting.
*  And that's just looking at life as we understand it. And there might be a lot of life out of their
*  life out there that's profoundly different to us in ways that are the province of molecular
*  chemistry as much as biology or psychology. But if we meet it, and if it has a sentience anywhere
*  near ours, you know, any kind of sentience sapience at all, we would have a duty to try
*  and communicate to try and bridge that gap. And so I run through these thought experiments,
*  really looking at what we know of even earth creatures that are very different to us in the
*  way that they operate and thinking, well, where, where do you come together?
*  This theme of your books had a similar quality to the question of sentience for me,
*  where it seemed to turn the telescope around a bit. When I think of a movie like Arrival,
*  which is all about the question of how would we learn to communicate with a highly advanced
*  alien civilization that landed here. In some way, if we've decided the communication needs to happen,
*  and we know it has to happen with something very, very different from us, at least we know what the
*  problem is, it has to be solved. Maybe it's not solvable, but at least we, I think, assess it
*  correctly. And something that struck me thinking about these questions within the context of your
*  books is how often we are deceived, I think, by thinking it's not a problem at all within our
*  own species, how much within a marriage, within a friendship, within a family, between countries,
*  between different groups of people. The assumption is we can communicate. The assumption is you're
*  hearing what I have said and you are just not doing it, or you know what it is I need and you're
*  just not providing it. You are like me and then by acting in a way that I don't like, you are
*  rejecting me. How much we think communication should be a self-problem and it isn't, and how
*  much of conflict and enmity and resentment it hurt, I think, comes from a real underestimation
*  of just how different even someone who lives with us, knows us, and loves us is from us,
*  how different their experience of the world is. And I don't know how rarely we're really taught
*  to appreciate the difficulty of communicating, even comparatively to your books, minor gap that
*  separates us from each other. I think that's very true. I think empathy is a great human ability,
*  but it is something we are, I think, constantly in danger of losing because we do construct
*  pictures of the people we interact with in our heads based on the signals they are sending out
*  and completely ignorant of the internality of what's going on so that the driver in front of
*  you is very slow, so you're very annoyed and you construct this idea of, well, obviously,
*  they're just doing this to annoy me or they're a bad driver or something. You don't know what
*  day they've had and what problems they've got. And so I can go home and someone will say something
*  to me and I will be annoyed and I will think, well, they're being very annoying to me. They're
*  obviously just trying to get a ride out to me or something like that. And actually, no, it's because
*  I've had a bad day and they've said something entirely unconquerable. But this comes back also
*  to our sense of a fixed self and the fact that it is not the case. Rather than interpret events
*  and say, well, I am obviously out of sorts today, it's much more of a knee-jerk human reaction to
*  say, well, that person is deliberately being aggravating. That person is, they're being slow.
*  It's not that I haven't said something cogently, it's that they are willfully not understanding
*  what I'm saying. And again, I think it really does come back to this idea that we believe ourselves
*  to be the sort of the unconquerable self, this sort of concrete unchanging, this is the way we are
*  this of us, which doesn't really exist. But rather than confront the fact that it doesn't exist, we
*  externalize the fault of any miscommunications and problems with our social interactions with others
*  onto those others. And of course, because they're also doing it to us,
*  this is where our arguments come from. I think that is a lovely place to end. So always our final
*  question, what are three books that have influenced you that you would recommend to the audience?
*  So Gene Wolf Soldier in the Mists is a fascinating exploration of a book written by someone who
*  doesn't have that core of self because it's the diary of an amnesiac soldier. In fact, back in
*  sort of Hellenic Greece, whose account of battles and gods and monsters and all manner of stuff
*  is just told day to day by someone who cannot remember what they wrote down previously and
*  very seldom had the chance to read up on their own notes. After Atlas by Emma Newman is one I'd
*  throw out there. That's a relatively recent science fiction book in her Planetfall series.
*  And I throw it in there mostly because it has some of the most sort of bleakly plausible
*  bad human politics going on there. I mean, I tend to like to talk about recent books rather
*  than the classic golden age of science fiction because I kind of feel we've got a lot of very
*  interesting stuff going on in the genre right now. Another recent book is RF Quang's Babel,
*  which has the most astonishing examination of imperialism and language and appropriation
*  as part of its fantasy plot.
*  Adrian Tchaikovsky, thank you very much.
