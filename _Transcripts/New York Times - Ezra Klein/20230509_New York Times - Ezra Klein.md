# Best Of: Why Adults Lose the ‘Beginner’s Mind’
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [May 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-53O38848U)
*  Hey, it's Ezra. I'm out today, but I wanted to share a past favorite episode with the
*  psychologist Alison Gopnik recorded in April 2021. One thing I like about this particular
*  episode is that there are parts of it and you're going to know which ones they are that
*  are more relevant today and relevant for very different reasons than when we recorded it.
*  I like episodes that age well. Enjoy.
*  I'm Ezra Klein and this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  It probably won't surprise you that I'm one of those parents who reads a lot of books
*  about parenting and they're mostly bad, particularly the books for dads. So many of those books
*  have this weird, dude, you're going to be a dad bro tone. It's a, it's a terrible literature,
*  but one of the great finds for me in the parenting book world has been Alison Gopnik's work.
*  Gopnik runs the Cognitive Development and Learning Lab at UC Berkeley. She's in both
*  the psychology and philosophy departments there. She's part of the AI working group
*  there. And one of the things about her work, the thing that sets it apart for me is she
*  uses children and studies children to understand all of us. She takes childhood seriously as
*  a phase in human development and why not, right? You're watching consciousness come
*  online in real time. You're watching language and culture and social rules being absorbed
*  and learned and changed, importantly changed. Her books haven't just changed how I look
*  at my son. They've really changed how I look at myself, how I look at all of us. And one
*  of them in particular that I read recently is The Philosophical Baby, which blew my mind
*  a little bit because what she does in that book is show through a lot of experiments
*  that there is a way in which children are a lot smarter than adults. I think it's the
*  right way to say that. A way in which their strangest, silliest seeming behaviors are
*  actually remarkable. This is her core argument. Children are tuned to learn. And when you
*  tune a mind to learn, it actually is to work really differently than a mind that already
*  knows a lot. The efficiency that our minds develop as we get older, it has amazing advantages.
*  Unlike my son, and I don't want to brag here, unlike my son, I can make it from his bedroom
*  to the kitchen without any stops along the way. I can just get right there. But also
*  unlike my son, I take so much for granted. I have so much trouble actually taking the
*  world on its own terms and trying to derive how it works. I've learned so much that I've
*  lost the ability to unlearn what I know. And that means I've also sometimes lost the ability
*  to question things correctly. So this isn't just a conversation about kids or for parents.
*  It's a conversation about humans for humans. We spend so much time and effort trying to
*  teach kids to think like adults. A message of Gopnik's work, and one I take seriously,
*  is we need to spend more time and effort as adults trying to think more like kids. As
*  always, my email is eserclineshow.com if you've got something to teach me. But here is Alison
*  Gopnik.
*  You write that children aren't just defective adults, primitive grownups who are gradually
*  attaining our perfection and complexity. Instead, children and adults are different forms of
*  Homo sapiens. How so?
*  Well, from an evolutionary biology point of view, one of the things that's really striking
*  is this relationship between what biologists call life history, how our developmental sequence
*  unfolds, and things like how intelligent we are. And there's a very, very general relationship
*  between how long a period of childhood an organism has and roughly how smart they are,
*  how big their brains are, how flexible they are. And an idea that I think a lot of us
*  have now is that part of that is because you've really got these two different creatures.
*  So you've got one creature that's really designed to explore, to learn, to change. That's the
*  child form. And then you've got this other creature that's really designed to exploit,
*  as computer scientists say, to go out, find resources, make plans, make things happen,
*  including finding resources for that wild, crazy explorer that you have in your nursery.
*  And the idea is that those two different developmental and evolutionary agendas come with
*  really different kinds of cognition, really different kinds of computation, really different
*  brains. And I think with very different kinds of experiences of the world. So the very way that
*  you experience the world, your consciousness is really different if your agenda is going to be
*  get the next thing done, figure out how to do it, figure out what the next thing to do after that
*  is versus extract as much information as I possibly can from the world. And I think adults have the
*  capacity to some extent to go back and forth between those two states. But I think that babies
*  and young children are in that explore state all the time. That's really what they're designed to
*  do. They're like a different kind of creature than the adult. You know, you sort of might think about,
*  well, are there other ways that evolution could have solved this explorer exploit trade-off,
*  this problem about how do you get a creature that can do things but can also learn things really
*  widely? And Peter Gottfried Smith's wonderful book I've just been reading, Metazoa, talks about the
*  octopus. And the octopus is very puzzling because the octo's don't have a long childhood. And yet
*  they seem to be really smart. And they have these big brains with lots of neurons. But it also turns
*  out that octo's actually have divided brains. So they have one brain in the center in their head,
*  and then they have another brain or maybe eight brains in each one of the tentacles. And if you
*  actually watch what the octo's do, the tentacles are out there doing the explorer thing. They're
*  getting information, figuring out what the water is like. And then the central head brain is doing
*  things like saying, okay, now it's time to squirt. Now it's time to get food. So my thought is that
*  we could imagine an alternate evolutionary path by which each of us was both a child and an adult.
*  So, you know, imagine if your arms were like your two-year-old, right? So that you are always trying
*  to get them to stop exploring because you had to get lunch. I suspect that may be what the
*  consciousness of an octo is like. Now, we're obviously not like that. But I think even human
*  adults, that might be an interesting kind of model for some of what it's like to be a human
*  adult in particular. So I think we have children who really have this explorer brain and in this
*  explorer experience, they're kind of like our tentacles. They're going out and figuring things
*  out in the world. And then we have adults who are really the head brain, the one that's actually
*  going out and doing things. But I think even as adults, we can have this kind of split brain
*  phenomenon where a bit of our experience is like being a child again and vice versa.
*  I feel like that's an answer is going to launch a hundred science fiction short stories.
*  People imagine this race that you're describing here. One of the things I really liked about this
*  is that it pushes towards a real respect for the child's brain. If one defined intelligence
*  as like the ability to learn and to learn fast and to learn flexibly, a two-year-old is probably a
*  lot more intelligent right now than I am. I have more knowledge and I have more experience and I
*  have more ability to exploit existing learnings, but they have more capacity and flexibility and
*  changeability. Is that right? And to the extent it is, what gives it that flexibility? What are
*  the trade-offs to have that flexibility? Yeah. So I think a really deep idea that
*  comes out of computer science originally, in fact, came out of the original design of the computer,
*  is this idea of the explorer exploit trade-off is what they call it. So if you're thinking about
*  intelligence, there's a real genuine trade-off between your ability to explore as many options
*  as you can versus your ability to quickly, efficiently commit to a particular option
*  and implement it. And it turns out that, you know, even if you just do the math,
*  it's really impossible to get a system that optimizes both of those things at the same time,
*  that is exploring and exploiting simultaneously because they're really deeply in tension with
*  one another. And the way that computer scientists have figured out to try to solve this problem
*  very characteristically is give the system a chance to explore first, give it a chance to figure out
*  all the information, and then once it's got the information, it can go out and it can exploit
*  later on. So it's explore first and then exploit. And I think that evolution has used that strategy
*  in designing development, human development in particular, because we have this really long
*  childhood. But I think you can see the same thing in non-human animals and not just in mammals,
*  but in birds and maybe even in insects. So you see this really deep tension, which I think we're
*  facing all the time, between how much are we considering different possibilities and how
*  much are we acting efficiently and swiftly. There's, again, an intrinsic tension between how much you
*  know and how open you are to new possibilities. So again, just something you can formally show
*  is that if I know a lot, then I should really rely on that knowledge. And I should, to some extent,
*  discount something new that somebody tells me. Whereas if I don't know a lot, then almost by
*  definition, I have to be open to more knowledge. But I think it's more than just the fact that you
*  have what the Zen masters call beginner's mind, that you start out not knowing as much. I think
*  we can actually point to things like the physical makeup of a child's brain and an adult brain that
*  make them differently adapted for exploring and exploiting. Use some work on this. What does look
*  different in the two brains? So there's two big areas of development that seem to be different.
*  So one of them is that the young brain seems to start out making many, many new connections. So
*  what you'll see when you look at a chart of synaptic development, for instance, is you've
*  got this early period when many, many, many new connections are being made. And then you've got
*  this later period where the connections that are used a lot, that are working well, they get
*  maintained, they get strengthened, they get to be more efficient. And then the ones that aren't are
*  pruned, as neuroscientists say, they kind of disappear. The consequence of that is that you
*  have this young brain that has a lot of what neuroscientists call plasticity. It can change
*  really easily, essentially. But it's not very good at like putting on its jacket and getting
*  into preschool in the morning. It's not very good at doing anything that is the sort of things that
*  you need to act well. And it's especially not good at things like inhibition. It's especially not good
*  at doing things like having one part of the brain restrict what another part of the brain is going
*  to do. So that's one change, this change from this lots of local connections, lots of plasticity to
*  something that's got longer and more efficient connections, but is less changeable. The other
*  change that's particularly relevant to humans is that we have the prefrontal cortex. That's the
*  part of our brain that's sort of the executive office of the brain where long term planning,
*  inhibition, focus, all those things seem to be done by this part of the brain. And what happens
*  with development is that that part of the brain, that executive part gets more and more control
*  over the rest of the brain as you get older. So that the ability to have an impulse in the back
*  of your brain and the front of your brain can come in and shut that out, or there's abstraction in
*  the back of your brain, something that is in your visual field that isn't relevant to what you do,
*  and the frontal part can literally shut down that other part of your brain. But that process takes
*  a long time. So when you start out, you've got much less of that kind of frontal control, more of
*  I guess, in some ways, almost more like the octos where parts of your brain are doing their own thing.
*  And then as you get older, you get more and more of that control. And is that the dynamic that leads
*  to this spotlight consciousness, lantern consciousness distinction? And can you talk
*  about that? Because I know think about it all the time. So those are two really, really different
*  kinds of consciousness. One kind of consciousness, this is an old metaphor is to think about attention
*  as being like a spotlight. It comes in, it illuminates the thing that you want to find out about,
*  and you don't see the things that are on your other side. And I think that in other states of
*  consciousness, especially the state of consciousness you're in when you're a child, but I think there
*  are things that adults do that put them in that state as well. You have something that's much more
*  like a lantern. So you're actually taking in information from everything that's going on around
*  you. And the most important thing is, is this going to teach me something? Is this new? Is this
*  interesting? Is this curious? Rather than focusing your attention and consciousness on just one thing
*  at a time. So a lot of the theories of consciousness start out from what I think of as professorial
*  consciousness. So surprise, surprise, when philosophers and psychologists are thinking
*  about consciousness, they think about the kind of consciousness that philosophers and psychologists
*  have a lot of the time. And that sort of consciousness is say you're sitting in your chair,
*  you have the paper to write, you're desperately trying to focus on the specific things that you
*  said that you would do. And then you kind of get distracted and your mind wanders a bit and you
*  start ruminating about other things. And that kind of goal-directed focused consciousness, which goes
*  very much with the sense of a self. So there's a me that's trying to finish up the paper or answer
*  the emails or do all the things that I have to do. That's really been the focus of a lot of theories
*  of consciousness is if that kind of consciousness was what consciousness was all about. And we even
*  can show neurologically that for instance, what happens in that state is when I attend to something
*  when I pay attention to something, what happens is the thing that I'm paying attention to becomes
*  much brighter and more vivid. And I actually shut down all the other things that I'm not paying
*  attention to. You can even see that in the brain. So the part of your brain that's relevant to what
*  you're attending to becomes more active, more plastic, more changeable. And the other nearby
*  parts get shut down, again, inhibited. So there's a really nice picture about what happens in
*  professorial consciousness. That's kind of how consciousness works. And again, maybe not
*  surprisingly, people have acted as if that kind of consciousness is what consciousness is really all
*  about. Like that's really what you want when you're conscious. And what I would argue is there's all
*  these other kinds of states of experience, and not just me, other philosophers as well,
*  there's all these other kinds of ways of being sentient, ways of being aware, ways of being
*  conscious that are not like that at all. So one interesting example that there's actually some
*  studies of is think about when you're completely absorbed in a really interesting movie, you're
*  kind of gone, yourself is gone. You're not deciding what to pay attention to in the movie, the movie's
*  just completely captivating. In the state of that focused goal-directed consciousness, those frontal
*  areas are very involved and very engaged. And there seem to actually be two pathways. One of them is
*  the one that sort of hears the goal-directed pathway, what they sometimes call the task-dependent
*  activity. And then the other one is what's sometimes called the default mode. And that's the sort of
*  ruminating or thinking about the other things that you have to do, being in your head, as we say,
*  as the other mode. When you look at someone who's in the scanner, who's really absorbed in a great
*  movie, neither of those parts are really active. And instead, other parts of the brain are more
*  active. And that brain, the brain of the person who's absorbed in the movie, looks more like the
*  child's brain. But now, whether you're a philosopher or not, or an academic or a journalist, or just
*  somebody who spends a lot of time on their computer or a student, we now have a modernity
*  that is constantly training something more like spotlight consciousness, probably more so than
*  would have been true at other times in human history. And something that I took from your book
*  is that there is the ability to train or at least experience different kinds of consciousness through
*  different kinds of either experiences like travel or you talk about meditation. But one of the
*  thoughts that triggered for me is that somebody who's been pretty involved in meditation for the
*  last decade or so, there's a real dominance of Vipassana style concentration meditation,
*  single point meditations, just watch the breath, just think about the breath right at the edge of
*  the nostril. And without taking anything away from that tradition, it made me wonder if one reason
*  that has become so dominant in America and particularly in Northern California is because
*  it's a very good match for the kind of concentration that our consciousness and our economy is
*  constantly trying to develop in us is sort of, you know, this get things done, you know, be very
*  focused, don't ruminate too much, you know, like a neoliberal form of consciousness. Do you think
*  there's something to that? I think that there's a paradox about, for example, going out and saying,
*  I am going to meditate and stop trying to get goals because I have this goal, which is I want
*  to be a much better meditator. And I have done a bit of meditation and workshops. And it's always
*  a little amusing when you see, you know, the young men who are going to prove that they're
*  better at meditating, they can sit for longer than anybody else can. But I think it's important to
*  say when you're thinking about things like meditation, or you're thinking about alternative
*  states of consciousness in general, that there's lots of different alternative states of consciousness.
*  So it isn't just a choice between lantern and spotlight. There's lots of different ways that
*  we have of being in the world, lots of different kinds of experiences that we have. And I suspect
*  that they each come with a separate, a different kind of focus, a different way of being. And in
*  meditation, you can see the contrast between some of these more pointed kinds of meditation versus
*  what's sometimes called open awareness meditation. So open awareness meditation is when you're not
*  just focused on one thing, when you try to be open to everything that's going on around you. And the
*  phenomenology of that is very much like this kind of lantern that everything at once is illuminated.
*  And I think that kind of open-ended meditation and the kind of consciousness that it goes with
*  is actually a lot like things that, for example, the romantic poets like Wordsworth talked about.
*  So there's this lovely concept that I like of the numinous. And sometimes it's connected with
*  spirituality, but I don't think it has to be. It's this idea that you're going through the world and
*  often quite suddenly, if you're an adult, everything in the world seems to be significant
*  and important and important and significant in a way that makes you insignificant by comparison.
*  My colleague, Dr. Keltner, has studied awe, and awe is kind of an example of this. But the numinous
*  sort of turns up the dial on awe. And part of the numinous is it doesn't just have to be about
*  something that's bigger than you, like a mountain. It could just be your garden or the street that
*  you're walking on. And suddenly that becomes illuminated and everything around you becomes
*  illuminated and you yourself sort of disappear. And I think that's kind of the best analogy I can
*  think of for the state that the children are in. And it's worth saying, it's not like the children
*  are always in that state. So the children, perhaps because they spend so much time in that state,
*  also can be fussy and cranky and desperately wanting their next meal or desperately wanting
*  comfort. They're not always in that kind of broad state. But I think they spend much more
*  of their time in that state. That's more like their natural state than adults are.
*  TITLE CARD SCREEN Do you think for kids that play
*  or imaginative play should be understood as a form of consciousness, a state?
*  DR. KELTNER Yeah, that's a really good question. So there's really a kind of coherent whole about
*  what childhood is all about. So if you think from this broad evolutionary perspective about these
*  creatures that are designed to explore, I think there's a whole lot of other things that go with
*  that. So one thing that goes with that is this broad-based consciousness. But another thing that
*  goes with it is the activity of play. And if you think about play, the definition of play is that
*  it's the thing that you do when you're not working. Now it's not a form of experience and consciousness
*  so much, but it's a form of activity. It's a form of actually doing things that nevertheless have
*  this characteristic of not being immediately directed to a goal. If you look across animals,
*  for example, very characteristically, it's the young animals that are playing across an incredibly
*  wide range of different kinds of animals. Sometimes if they're mice, they're play fighting. And if
*  they're crows, they're playing with twigs and figuring out how they can use the twigs. So what
*  goes on in play is different. But it's really fascinating that it's the young animals who are
*  playing. And all of the theories that we have about play are plays another form of this kind
*  of exploration. So it's another way of having this explore state of being in the world. Now it's not
*  so much about you're visually taking in all the information around you the way that you do when
*  you're exploring. Now it's more like you're actually doing things on the world to try to explore the
*  space of possibilities. You know, another thing that people point out about play is play is fun.
*  There's a certain kind of happiness and joy that goes with being in that state when you're just
*  playing. And again, it's not the state that kids are in all the time, but the state that they're in
*  a lot of the time and a state that they're in when they're actually engaged in play.
*  One of the things that's really fascinating that's coming out in AI now, and I've been
*  spending a lot of time collaborating with people in computer science at Berkeley who are trying to
*  design better artificial intelligence systems, the current systems that we have, I mean, the
*  languages, they're designed to optimize. They're really exploit systems. What you do with these
*  systems is say, here's what your goal is. Now you go out and maximize that goal. And it turns out
*  that if you have a system like that, it will be very good at doing the things that it was optimized
*  for, but not very good at being resilient, not very good at changing when things are different.
*  Right. I've been really struck working with people in robotics, for example, you know, when people
*  say, well, the robots have trouble generalizing, they don't mean they have trouble generalizing
*  from, you know, driving a Tesla to driving a Lexus. They mean they have trouble going from
*  putting the block down at this point to putting the block down a centimeter to the left. Right.
*  I mean, you know, they really have trouble generalizing even when they're very good.
*  And it turns out that if you get these systems to have a period of play where they can just be
*  generating things in a wilder way or get them to train on a human playing, they end up being much
*  more resilient. They're much better at generalizing, which is of course the great thing that children
*  are also really good at. I was thinking about how a moment ago you said play is what you do when
*  you're not working. And I was thinking, it's absolutely not what I do when I'm not working.
*  I'm constantly like you sitting here, be like, don't work. And that's not playing. And in fact,
*  I think I've lost a lot of my capacity for play. You know, I've trained myself to be productive
*  so often that it's sometimes hard to put it down. And it takes like actual dedicated effort to not
*  do things that feel like work to me. What's lost in that? Because I think there's cultural pressure
*  to not play. But I think that your research and some of the others suggest maybe we've made a
*  terrible mistake on that by not honoring play more. Yeah, I think there's a lot of evidence for that.
*  And it's interesting that, as I say, the hard-headed engineers who are trying to,
*  you know, do things like design robots are increasingly realizing that play is something
*  that's going to actually be able to get you systems that do better in going through the world.
*  Part of the problem, and this is a general exploit problem, part of the problem with play
*  is if you think about it in terms of what its long-term benefits are going to be,
*  then it isn't play anymore. And if you sort of set up any particular goal, if you say,
*  oh, well, if you play more, you'll be more robust or more resilient. And you say, okay,
*  so now I want to design you to do this particular thing well, then you're always going to do better
*  by just optimizing for that particular thing than by playing. So what play is really about is about
*  this ability to change, to be resilient in the face of lots of different environments, in the face of
*  lots of different possibilities. It's about dealing with something new or unexpected. And it's
*  interesting that if you look at what might look like a really different literature, look at
*  studies about the effects of preschool on later development in children. So when they first started
*  doing these studies where you looked at the effects of an enriching preschool, and these were play
*  based preschools, the way preschools still are to some extent and certainly should be and have been
*  in the past. So, you know, basically you put a child in a rich environment where there's lots of
*  opportunities for play. And it turned out that if you looked at things like just how well you did
*  on a standardized test, after a couple of years, the effects seem to sort of fade out. And that was
*  an argument against early education. But it turns out that if you look 30 years later, you have these
*  sleeper effects, where these children who played are not necessarily getting better grades three
*  years later, but they're not going to prison, and their health is better, and their salaries are
*  higher. And what that suggests is things that having a lot of experience with play was letting
*  you do was to be able to deal with unexpected challenges better, rather than that it was allowing
*  you to attain any particular outcome. And it really makes it tricky if you want to do evidence based
*  policy, which we all want to do. And that's optimistic. Well, or what at least some people
*  want to do any kind of metric that you set, almost by definition, if it's the metric, you're going to
*  do better if you teach to the test. So there's always this temptation to do that, even though the
*  advantages that play gives you seem to be these advantages of robustness and resilience. So for
*  instance, if you look at rats, and you look at the rats who get to do play fighting versus rats who
*  don't, it's not that the rats who play can do things that the rats who can't play can't, like every
*  specific fighting technique the rats will have. But if you look at their subtlety, at their ability
*  to deal with context at their ability to decide when should I do this versus that? How should I
*  deal with the whole ensemble that I'm in? That's where play has its great advantages.
*  Do you play? Well, I was going to say when you were saying that you don't play,
*  you read science fiction, right? And you watch the Marvel comic universe movies. I do do that.
*  And I think for grownups, that's really the equivalent of the kind of especially the kind
*  of pretend playing and imaginative play that you see in children. And those two things are very
*  parallel. There's even a nice study by Marjorie Taylor, who studied a lot of this imaginative play
*  that when you talk to people who are adult writers, for example, they tell you that they
*  remember their imaginary friends from when they were kids. Everybody has imaginary friends,
*  but you know, it's sort of like, they keep them in their Rolodex, they keep in touch with their
*  imaginary friends. And I think for adults, a lot of the function, which has always been kind of
*  mysterious, like why would reading about something that hasn't happened help you to understand
*  things that have happened? Or why would it be good in general? I think for adults, a lot of that kind
*  of activity is the equivalent of play. And I don't do that as much as I would like to, or as much as
*  I did 20 years ago, which makes me think a little about how the society has changed. But I do think
*  that counts as play for adults. And of course, you've got the best play thing there could be,
*  which is if you've got a two year old or a three year old or a four year old, they kind of force
*  you to be in that state, whether you start out wanting to be or not. Yeah, there's definitely
*  something to that. I'd have to spend a lot more time thinking about pickle trucks now.
*  One of the arguments we make throughout the book is that children play a population level role,
*  right? We're talking here about the way a child becomes an adult, how do they learn,
*  how do they play in a way that keeps them from going to jail later. But you sort of say that
*  children are the R&D wing of our species and that as generations turn over, we change in ways and
*  adapt to things in ways that the normal genetic pathway of evolution wouldn't necessarily predict.
*  And we do it partially through children. Can you talk a bit about that? What this sort of period
*  of plasticity is doing at scale? Yeah, so I think that's a good question. And we don't really
*  completely know what the answer is. But again, the sort of baseline is that humans have this
*  really, really long period of immaturity. So we have more different people who are involved
*  and engaged in taking care of children. And all that looks is if it's very evolutionary costly.
*  So there's a question about why would it be now, of course, it could just be an epiphenomenon, but
*  it seems to be a really general pattern across so many different species at so many different
*  times. So what kind of function could that serve? Well, if you think about human beings,
*  we're being faced with unexpected environments all the time. One way you could think about it is
*  our ecological niche is the unknown unknowns. That's really what we're adapted to are the
*  unknown unknowns. That's what we're all about. And of course, once we develop culture, that just gets
*  to be more true because each generation is going to change its environment in various ways that
*  affect its culture. And that means that now the next generation is going to have yet another
*  new thing to try to deal with and to understand. So I think more and more, especially in the cultural
*  context, that having a new generation that can look around at everything around it and say,
*  let me try to make sense out of this, or let me understand this and let me think of all the
*  new things that I could do given this new environment, which is the thing that children,
*  and I think not just infants and babies, but up through adolescence that children are doing,
*  that could be a real advantage. And then once you've done that kind of exploration of the
*  space of possibilities, then as an adult, now in that environment, you can decide which of those
*  things you want to have happen. Does this help explain why revolutionary political ideas are so
*  much more appealing to sort of teens and 20 somethings? And then why so much revolutionary
*  political action comes from those age groups, comes from students, it's partially this ability
*  to exist within the imaginarium and have a little bit more of a porous border between what exists
*  and what could than you have when you're 50? So we actually did some really interesting
*  experiments where we were looking at how these kinds of flexibility develop over the space of
*  development. And one of the things that we discovered was that if you look at your
*  understanding of the physical world, the preschoolers are the most flexible and then they get less
*  flexible at school age and then less so at adolescence. But if you look at the social world,
*  there's really this burst of plasticity and flexibility in adolescence. And the neuroscience
*  suggests that too. So if you look at the social parts of the brain, you see this kind of rebirth
*  of plasticity and flexibility in adolescence. And I think that that's exactly what you were saying,
*  exactly what that's for, is that it gives the adolescents a chance to consider new kinds of
*  social possibilities and to take the information that they've got from the people around them
*  and say, okay, given that that's true, what's something new that we could do? What's something
*  different from what we've done before? And if you look at the literature about cultural evolution,
*  I think it's true that culture is one of the really distinctive human capacities. There's
*  this constant tension between imitation and innovation. So to have a culture, one thing you
*  need to do is to have a generation that comes in and can take advantage of all the other things
*  that the previous generations have learned. But of course, what you also want is for that new
*  generation to be able to modify and tweak and change and alter the things that the previous
*  generation has done. And I think the period of childhood and adolescence in particular
*  gives you a chance to be that kind of cutting edge of change. And empirically, what you see is that
*  very often for things like music or clothing or culture or politics or social change, you see that
*  the adolescents are on the edge for better or for worse. And again, there's this kind of trade-off
*  tension between all us cranky old people saying, what's wrong with kids nowadays? Because there's a
*  reason why the previous generation is doing the things that they're doing. And the sense of here's
*  this great range of possibilities that we haven't considered before.
*  What is this somewhat deeper understanding of the child's brain imply for caregivers? What does
*  taking more seriously what these states of consciousness are like, say about how you should
*  act as a parent and uncle and aunt or grandparent? Well, I think here's the wrong message to take,
*  first of all, which I think is often the message that gets taken from this kind of information,
*  especially in our time and our place and among people in our culture. The wrong message is, oh,
*  okay, they're doing all this learning, so we better start teaching them really, really early. We better
*  make sure that all this learning is going to be shaped in the way that we want it to be shaped.
*  And we better make sure that we're doing the right things and we're buying the right apps and we're
*  reading the right books and we're doing the right things to shape that kind of learning in the way
*  that we as adults think that it should be shaped. And that's not the right thing. That's actually
*  working against the very function of this early period of exploration and learning.
*  But I do think something that's important is that the very mundane investment that we make as
*  caregivers, you know, keeping the kids alive, figuring out what it is that they want or need
*  at any moment, there's things that are often, you know, very time consuming and require a lot of
*  work. It's that context of being secure and having resources and not having to worry about
*  the immediate circumstances that you're in, that context that caregivers provide, that's absolutely
*  crucial. It's absolutely essential for that broad-based learning and understanding to happen.
*  So just by doing, just by being a caregiver, just by caring, what you're doing is providing the
*  context in which this kind of exploration can take place. And, you know, we're pretty well designed
*  to think it's good to care for children in the first place, but I think especially for, you know,
*  sort of self-reflective parents, the fact that part of what you're doing is allowing that to happen
*  is really important. And then the other thing is that I think being with children in that way is a
*  great way for adults to get a sense of what it would be like to have that broader focus. So going
*  for a walk with a two-year-old is like going for a walk with William Blake. You know, you go to the
*  corner to get milk and part of what we can even show from the neuroscience is that as adults,
*  when you do something really often, you become habituated, you do the same thing over and over
*  again, it kind of disappears from your consciousness. You're not doing it with much experience. And again,
*  that's a lot of the times, that's a good thing because there's other things that we have to do.
*  But if you do the same walk with a two-year-old, you realize, wait a minute, this three blocks is
*  just amazing. It's so rich. There's dogs and there's geese and there's pizza flyers and there is plants
*  and trees and there's airplanes. I'm sure you've seen this with your two-year-old with this
*  phenomenon of sort of plane, plane, plane. And then you suddenly realize airplanes. Oh, wait a minute.
*  He's like a radar. I didn't know that there was an airplane there, but now that you pointed out,
*  sure enough, there is one there. So I think the other thing is that being with children can
*  give adults a sense of this broader way of being in the world. So I think both of you can appreciate
*  the fact that caring for children is this fundamental, foundational, important thing
*  that is allowing exploration and learning to take place. Rather than thinking that that's just kind
*  of the scot work and what you really need to do is go out and do explicit teaching. That's a way
*  of appreciating it. And I think having this kind of empathic relationship to the children who are
*  exploring so much is another. What should having more respect for the child's mind change, not for
*  how we care for children, but how we care for ourselves or what kinds of things we open ourselves
*  into? If I want to make my mind a little bit more childlike, aside from trying to appreciate the
*  William Blake-like nature of children, are there things of the child's life that I should be trying
*  to bring into mind? Well, we know something about the sort of functions that this childlike brain
*  serves. So one thing is being able to deal with a lot of new information. And if you think about
*  something like traveling to a new place, that's a good example for adults where just being some
*  place that you haven't been before, or another example is just trying to learn a skill that you
*  haven't learned before. Even if you're not very good at it, someone once said that if something's
*  worth doing, it's worth doing badly. Just trying to do something that's different from the things
*  that you've done before, just that can itself put you into a state that's more like the childlike
*  state. And again, there's trade-offs, because of course we get to be good at doing things,
*  and then we want to do the things that we're good at. But setting up a new place, a new technique,
*  a new relationship to the world, that's something that seems to help to put you in this childlike
*  state. And to go back to the parenting point, socially putting people in a state where they
*  feel as if they've got a lot of resources, and they're not under immediate pressure to
*  produce a particular outcome, that seems to be something that helps people to be in this,
*  helps even adults to be in this more playful, exploratory state.
*  CB What do you think about the twin studies
*  that people use to suggest parenting doesn't really matter? Do you buy that evidence,
*  or do you think it's off? MS I think it's off,
*  but I think it's off in a way that's actually kind of interesting. So what I've argued is that
*  if you think that what having children does is introduce more variability into the world,
*  so it actually introduces more options, more outcomes. Each of the children comes out
*  differently. You get this different combination of genetics and environment and temperament,
*  and each one of them is going to come out to be really different from anything you would expect
*  beforehand, which is something that I think anybody who has had more than one child is
*  very conscious of. But if you think that part of the function of childhood is to introduce that
*  variability into the world, and that being a good caregiver has the effect of allowing children to
*  come out in all these different ways, then the basic methodology of the twin studies is to assume
*  that if parenting has an effect, it's going to have an effect by the child being more like the
*  parent and by, say, the three children that are the children of the same parent being more like
*  each other than, say, the twins who are adopted by different parents. That's the basic rationale
*  behind those studies. But if you think that what being a parent does is not make children more
*  like themselves and more like you, but actually make them more different from each other and
*  different from you, then when you do a twin study, you're not going to see that. In fact,
*  one of the things that I think people have been quite puzzled about in twin studies is this idea
*  of the non-shared environment. It turns out that you look at genetics, and that's responsible for
*  some of the variants, and you look at parental environment, and that's responsible for some of
*  it. But a lot of it is just all this other stuff, right? And no one quite knows where all that
*  variability is coming from. But if you think that actually having all that variability is not a bad
*  thing, it's a good thing, it's what you want, it's what childhood and parenting is all about, then
*  having that kind of variation that you can't really explain either by genetics or by what
*  the parents do, that's exactly what being a parent, being a caregiver is all about, is for.
*  So you gestured earlier in the conversation that you began doing a lot of work around AI,
*  and I find the direction you're coming into this from really interesting that there's this idea
*  we just create AI, and now there's increasingly a conversation over the possibility that we will
*  need to parent AI. Tell me a little bit about those collaborations and the angle you're taking on this.
*  KS So I've been collaborating with a whole group of people. It's been incredibly fun at the Berkeley
*  Artificial Intelligence Research Group. And what we've been trying to do is to try and see what
*  would you have to do to design an AI system that was as smart as a two-year-old, basically, right?
*  That could do the kinds of things that two-year-olds can do. And it's kind of striking
*  that the very best state-of-the-art systems that we have that are great at playing Go and playing
*  chess and maybe even driving in some circumstances are terrible at doing the kinds of things that
*  every two-year-old can do. And the idea is maybe we could look at some of the things that the
*  two-year-olds do when they're learning and see if that makes a difference to what the AIs are doing
*  when they're learning. So one way that I think about it sometimes is it's sort of like, if you
*  look at the current models for AI, it's like we're giving these AIs hyper helicopter tiger moms.
*  There's a programmer who's hovering over the AI and saying, oh yeah, yeah, you got that one right.
*  That one's a cat. That one's a dog. That one's another cat. That one's another dog. Or you have
*  the AI that's saying, oh, good, your Go score just went up, so do what you're doing there. But nope,
*  now you lost that game, so figure out something else to do. And as you might expect, what you
*  end up with is AI systems that are very, very good at doing the things that they were trained to do
*  and not very good at all at doing something different. So they can play chess, but if you
*  turn to a child and said, okay, we're just going to change the rules now so that instead of the
*  night moving this way, it moves another way, they'd be able to figure out how to adopt what
*  they're doing. And it's much harder for AI systems to do that. Now, one of the big problems that we
*  have in AI is what's come to be called the alignment problem is how can you get the AI
*  values to be aligned with the values of humans? So the famous example of this is the paper clip
*  apocalypse, where you try to train the robot to make paper clips, and it just goes around and
*  turns everything in the world, including all the humans and all houses and everything else into
*  paper clips. If you've got this kind of strategy of here's the goal, try to accomplish the goal
*  as best as you possibly can, then it's really kind of worrying about what the goal is, what the
*  values are that you're giving these AI systems. And one idea people have had is, well, are there
*  ways that we can make sure that those values are human values? But of course, one of the things
*  that's so fascinating about humans is we keep changing our objective functions. What counted
*  as being the good thing, the value 10 years ago might be really different from the thing that we
*  think is important or valuable now. We keep discovering that the things that we thought
*  were the right things to do are not the right things to do, and we change what we do as a result.
*  And it seems as if parents are playing a really deep role in that ability. So if you think about
*  what it's like to be a caregiver, it involves passing on your values. That's a really deep
*  part of it. But it also involves allowing the next generation to take those values, look at them in
*  the context of the environment they find themselves in now, reshape them, rethink them, do all the
*  things that we were mentioning that teenagers do, consider different kinds of alternatives.
*  And it's having a previous generation that's willing to do both those things, that's willing
*  to both pass on tradition and tolerate, in fact, even encourage change, that's willing to say,
*  here's my values, but your job is to figure out your own values. That's what lets humans keep
*  altering their values and goals, and most of the time for good. So the question is,
*  if we really wanted to have AIs that were really autonomous, and maybe we don't want to have AIs
*  that are really autonomous, but if we wanted to have AIs that had those kinds of capacities,
*  they'd need to have grandmoms. They'd need to have someone who would tell them,
*  here's what our human values are, and here's enough possibilities so that you could decide
*  what your values are and then hope that those values actually turn out to be the right ones.
*  Something that strikes me about this conversation is exactly what you were touching on, this idea
*  that you're going to have one objective function, the A will have one goal and that will never change.
*  You look at any kid, right, and I think it's called social reference learning. I mean,
*  they're constantly doing something, then they look back at their parents to see if their parent is
*  smiling or frowning, then they do something else and they look back. And this constant touching back,
*  I don't think I appreciated what a big part of development it was until I was a parent,
*  and I just saw how constant it is just all day doing something, touching back,
*  doing something, touching back like a hundred times an hour. And it seems like that would be
*  one way to work through that alignment problem, to just assume that the learning is going to be
*  social. It's not just going to be a goal function, it's going to be a conversation.
*  A.I. people love acronyms, it turns out. So the acronym we have for our project is MESS,
*  which stands for Model Building Exploratory Social Learning Systems. So one piece that we
*  think is really important is this exploration, this ability to go out and find out things about
*  the world, do experiments, be curious. One of the things that we're doing right now is using some
*  of these kind of video game environments to put AI agents and children literally in the same
*  environment. So the AI is trying to work through a maze in unity and the kids are working through
*  the maze in unity, and we can compare what it is that the kids and the AIs do in that same environment.
*  So one thing is to get them to explore, but another thing is to get them to do this kind
*  of social learning. So look at a person who's next to you and figure out what it is that they're
*  doing. And in robotics, for example, there's a lot of attempts to use this kind of imitative
*  learning to train robots. But here's the catch, and the catch is that innovation imitation trade-off
*  that I mentioned. And in empirical work that we've done, we've shown that when you look at
*  kids imitating, it's really fascinating because even three-year-olds will imitate the details of
*  what someone else is doing, but they'll integrate, okay, I saw you do this, I saw this other person
*  do something a little different. I have some information about how this machine works, for
*  example, myself, and the children will put all those together to design the next thing that would
*  be the right thing to do. So they're constantly social referencing, they imitate literally from
*  the moment that they're born, they're imitating us, they're paying attention to us, they're seeing
*  what we do. But then they're taking that information and integrating it with all the other information
*  they have, say, from their own exploration, and putting that together to try to design a new way
*  of being, to try and do something that's different from all the things that anyone has done before.
*  CB So the meta message of this conversation of what I took from your book is that learning a lot
*  about a child's brain actually throws a totally different light on the adult brain. As you've been
*  learning so much about the effort to create AI, has it made you think about the human brain differently?
*  BT Well, I have to say, actually being involved in the AI project, in many ways, makes the
*  differences more salient than the similarities. Because over and over again, something that is so
*  simple, say, for young children, that we just take it for granted, like the fact that when you go into
*  a new maze, you explore it, that turns out to be really hard to figure out how to do with an AI
*  system. Or to take the example about the robot imitators, this is a really lovely project that
*  we're working on with some people from Google Brain. They thought, okay, well, a good way to get
*  a robot to learn how to do things is to imitate what a human is doing. So what they did was have
*  humans who were, say, manipulating a bunch of putting things on a desk in a virtual environment,
*  and the robot is sitting there and watching what the human does when they take up the pen and put
*  it in the drawer in that virtual environment. And it turned out that the problem was if you train
*  the robot that way, then they learn how to do exactly the same thing that the human did. But
*  as I say, and this is always sort of amazing to me, you know, you put the pen five centimeters to
*  one side, and now they have no idea what to do. But it turns out that if instead of that, what you
*  do is you have the human just play with the things on the desk, you tell the human, I just want you to
*  do stuff with the things that are here. Just play with them. Just do the things that you think are
*  interesting or fun. And then you use that to train the robots, the robots are much more resilient.
*  So part of it is kind of goes in circles. So it's also for the children imitating the more
*  playful things that the adults are doing, or at least for robots, that's helping the robots to be
*  more effective. I think anyone who's worked with human brains and then goes to try to do AI, the
*  gulf is really pretty striking. And the difference between just the things that we take for granted
*  that say children are doing and the things that even the very best most impressive AI systems can
*  do is really striking. Now here's a specific thing that I'm puzzled about that I think we've learned
*  from looking at the AI example. In AI, you sort of have a choice often between just doing the thing
*  that's the obvious thing that you've been trained to do, or just doing something that's kind of
*  random and noisy. Those are sort of the options. The amazing thing about kids is that they do things
*  that are unexpected. They're not just doing the obvious thing, but they're not just behaving
*  completely randomly. And I think it's a really interesting question about how do you search
*  through a space of possibilities, for example, where you're searching and looking around widely
*  enough so that you can get to something that's genuinely new, but you aren't just doing something
*  that's completely random and noisy. I've been thinking about the old program, kids say the
*  darndest things. If you just think about the things that kids say, collect them. A lovely example that
*  one of my computer science postdocs gave the other day was that her three-year-old was walking on the
*  campus and saw the Campanile at Berkeley. So the Campanile is the big clock tower at Berkeley.
*  And he looked up at the clock tower and he said, there's a clock at the top there. There's a clock
*  way, way up high at the top of that tower. And then he said, I guess they want to make sure that
*  the children and the students don't break the clock. So they put it really, really high up.
*  It's very funny.
*  And that's exactly the example of the sort of things that children do. It's not something he's
*  ever heard anybody else say. It kind of makes sense. It's not random, but of course it's not
*  something that any grownup would say. In a sense, it's a really creative solution. And I think that
*  for AI, the challenge is how can we get a system that's capable of doing something that's really
*  new, which is what you want if you want robustness and resilience, and isn't just random, that is new
*  but appropriately new.
*  I always wonder if the AI two-year-old, three-year-old comparisons are just a
*  category error there in the sense that you might say a small bat can do something that no children
*  can do, which is it can fly. GPT-3, the open AI program, can do something that no two-year-old
*  can do effortlessly, which is mimic the text of a certain kind of author. Is it just going to be
*  the case that there are certain collaborations of our physical forms and molecular structures and
*  so on that give our intelligence different categories? I always wonder if there's almost
*  like a kind of comfort being taken at how hard it is to do two-year-old style things. And meanwhile,
*  I don't want to put too much weight on it's beating everybody at go, but that what it does seem
*  plausible it could do in 10 years will be quite remarkable. Now again, that's different than a
*  conscious agent that has to make its way through the world on its own. I'm curious how much weight
*  you put on the idea that that might just be the wrong comparison. This is the old point about
*  asking whether an AI can think is like asking whether a submarine can swim. It feels like it's
*  just a category error. And of course, as I say, we have two-year-olds around a lot, so we don't
*  really need more two-year-olds. We should be designing these systems so they're complementary
*  to our intelligence rather than somehow being a reproduction of our intelligence. But on the other
*  hand, there are various, again, just take something really simple, like it would be really good to
*  have robots that could pick things up and put them in boxes, right? Like that doesn't seem like such a
*  highfalutin skill to be able to have and that could pick things up and put them in boxes.
*  And now when you gave it a screw that looked a little different from the previous screw and
*  a box that looked a little different from the previous box, that they could figure out,
*  oh yeah, no, that one's a screw and it goes in the screw box, not the other box. And it turns out
*  that even to do just these really, really simple things that we would really like to have artificial
*  systems do, it's really hard. And those are things that two-year-olds do really well. And we can think
*  about what is it? On the other hand, the two-year-olds don't get bored knowing how to put things in boxes.
*  So what is it that they've got? What mechanisms do they have that could help us with some of these
*  kinds of problems? And another example that we've been working on a lot with the Bay Area Group
*  is just vision. So just look at a screen with a lot of pixels and make sense out of it. And
*  as you probably know, if you look at something like ImageNet, you can show, say, a deep learning
*  system, a whole lot of pictures of cats and dogs on the web, and eventually you'll get it so that
*  it can most of the time say this is a cat and this is a dog. But then you can give it something
*  that is just obviously not a cat or a dog, and they'll make a mistake. And they won't be able
*  to generalize, even to say a dog on a video that's actually moving. So even if you take something as
*  simple as that you would like to have your systems actually, you know, you'd like to have a computer
*  in your car actually be able to identify this is a pedestrian or a car, it turns out that even those
*  simple things involve abilities that we see in very young children that are actually quite hard
*  to program into a computer. Some of the things that we're looking at, for instance, is with
*  children when they're learning to identify objects in the world, one thing they do is they pick them
*  up and then they move around, look at them from different angles, look at them from the top, look
*  at them from the bottom, look at your hands this way, look at your hands that way, walk around to
*  the other side, pick things up and get into everything and make a terrible mess because
*  you're picking them up and throwing them around. But it turns out that may be just the kind of
*  thing that you need to do, not to do anything fancy, just to have vision, just to be able to
*  see the objects in the way that adults see the objects. I think it's a good place to come to a
*  close. So let me ask you a variation on what's our final question. What are three children's books
*  you love and would recommend to the audience? Yeah, so I was thinking a lot about this and I actually
*  had converged on two children's books and then yesterday I went to see my
*  grandchildren for the first time in a year, my beloved grandchildren, and I was really pleased
*  because my intuitions about the best books were completely confirmed by this great reunion with
*  the grandchildren. So my five-year-old grandson, who hasn't been in our house for a year, first said,
*  I love you, Grandma, and then said, you know, Grandma, do you still have that book, you know,
*  that book that you have at your house with a little boy who has like this white suit and he
*  goes to the island with the monsters on it and then he comes back again and I said, you mean
*  Where the Wild Things Are? That's the one with the wild things with the monsters. Do you still have
*  that book? Could we read that book at your house? So I figured that's a pretty serious endorsement
*  when a five-year-old remembers something from a year ago. So that's the first one, especially for
*  the younger children. All of them are Ascentex books, but especially Where the Wild Things Are
*  is a fantastic, wonderful book. And then for older children, that same day my nine-year-old,
*  who is very into the Marvel universe and superheroes, said, could we read a chapter
*  for Mary Poppins, which is again something that Grandmom reads and we had a marvelous time reading
*  Mary Poppins and he said, you know, the book is so much better than the movie and he was absolutely
*  right and the reason is that when you actually read the Mary Poppins books, especially the later
*  ones like Mary Poppins in the Park and Mary Poppins Opens the Door, Mary Poppins is a much
*  stranger, weirder, darker figure than Julie Andrews is. So if you've seen the movies, you have no idea
*  what Mary Poppins is about. Essentially what Mary Poppins is about is this very strange, surreal
*  set of adventures that the children are having with this figure who, as I said to Augie, is much
*  more like Iron Man or Batman or Doctor Strange than like Julie Andrews, right? You know, who's this
*  powerful, mysterious, sometimes dark, but ultimately good creature in your experience. So I keep
*  thinking, oh yeah, now what we really need to do is add Mary Poppins to the Marvel universe and that
*  would be a much better version. And let me give you a third book, which is much more obscure.
*  There's a book called The Children of Green No, K-N-O-W-E. I like this because it's a book about a
*  grandmother and her grandson and he comes to visit her in this strange old house in the Cambridge
*  countryside and gradually it gets to be clear that there are ghosts of the history of this house.
*  And what I like about all three of these books in their different ways is that I think they capture
*  this thing that's so distinctive about childhood. The fact that on the one hand, you're in this
*  safe place. So with The Wild Things, you know, he's in his room where mom is, where supper is
*  going to be, and all the time sitting in that room, he also adventures out in this boat to these
*  strange places where wild things are, including he himself as a wild thing. And the same thing's true
*  with Mary Poppins. So there are these children who are just leading this very ordinary British
*  middle-class life in the thirties and they're going to the greengrocer and the fishmonger.
*  And yet there's all this strangeness, this weirdness, this surreal things just about those
*  everyday experiences. And the same way with The Children of Green No, you're going to visit your
*  grandmother in her house in the country. And then it turns out that that house is full of
*  spirits and ghosts and traditions and things that you've learned from the past. All three of those
*  books really capture what's special about childhood. It's that combination of a small,
*  safe world. And it's actually having that small, safe world that lets you explore a much wilder,
*  easier, stranger set of worlds than any grownup ever gets to.
*  Alison Gopnik, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Ezra.
*  Thank you to Alison Gopnik for being here. I'm going to keep it up with these little
*  occasional recommendations after the show. I'm a writing nerd. I mean, obviously I'm a writer,
*  but I like writing software. When I went to Box Media, partially I did that because of their great
*  CMS or publishing software, Chorus. And I'm always looking for really good, clean composition apps.
*  I find Word and Pages and Google Talks to be just horrible to write in and having a good
*  space to write in. It actually helps me think. But I found something recently that I like,
*  and I'm not getting paid to promote them or anything. I just like it. It's called Calmly
*  Writer. You can just find it at calmlywriter.com. And it's the cleanest writing interface, simplest
*  of these programs I've found. So if you're looking for a real lightweight, easy place to do some
*  writing, Calmly Writer. But I'd be interested to hear what you all like because I've become a little
*  bit of a nerd about these apps. That's it for the show. Thank you for listening as always. If you
*  want to help the show out, leave us a review wherever you are listening to it now, or send
*  this episode to a friend, a family member, somebody you want to talk about it with. It really does help
*  the show grow. The Ezra Klan Show is a production of New York Times Opinion. It is produced by
*  Roja Karma and Jeff Geld, fact-checked by Michelle Harris, original music by Isaac Jones, and mixing
*  by Jeff Geld.
