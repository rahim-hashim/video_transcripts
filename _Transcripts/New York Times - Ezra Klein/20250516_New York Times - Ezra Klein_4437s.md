Video Description: Is Donald Trump eroding American democracy and consolidating power for himself? Or is he trying to do that and failing? Is this what sliding toward authoritarianism looks like? Or is this what a functioning democracy looks like? And how can you tell the difference?
Two articles came out recently that offer very different perspectives on these questions. In Vox, Zack Beauchamp wrote a piece called “Trump Is Losing,” which argues that Trump’s efforts to cow his enemies and consolidate power are not organized or strategic enough to make a serious dent in our democratic system. In The New Yorker, Andrew Marantz published a piece that he reported in Hungary, about how life in a modern authoritarian regime doesn’t look and feel like you might expect: “You can live through the big one, it turns out, and still go on acting as if — still go on feeling as if — the big one is not yet here,” he writes.
So I invited both Beauchamp and Marantz on the show to debate these big questions: What timeline are we on? What signs are they looking at? If we’ve crossed the line into authoritarianism, how would we know? Is Trump losing? Or is it possible he’s already won?

# Is Trump Losing? A Debate | The Ezra Klein Show
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28)
*  A question we talk about a lot amongst ourselves on the show right now is what timeline are we in? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=0.0s)]
*  And how will we know? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=7.2s)]
*  Are we watching the fundamental erosion of American democracy? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=8.88s)]
*  You're not going to be a dictator, are you? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=12.92s)]
*  I said no, no, no, other than day one. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=14.52s)]
*  Of its liberties? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=17.16s)]
*  He posted online a picture of himself in a crown with the phrase, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=18.28s)]
*  long live the king. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=21.8s)]
*  Of its safeguards? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=24.36s)]
*  I don't know. I think I'm not allowed to run again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=25.44s)]
*  I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Are we on a path that is quickly becoming irreversible? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  Or are we in the timeline where the Trump administration is doing a lot? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=34.0s)]
*  But to the extent it has a fundamental plan to reformat the way the American political system works, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=38.32s)]
*  that is simply running into too much opposition and it has too little power to succeed. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=44.36s)]
*  As we approach the 100-day mark, he has the lowest approval rating of any president in the past 80 years. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=50.28s)]
*  Today was another day of just loss after loss after loss for Donald Trump in court. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=54.68s)]
*  Two pieces recently came out that I thought created an interesting tension and interesting ways to look at this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  In Vox, Zach Beacham wrote this piece called Trump is Losing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=66.88s)]
*  Beacham has covered slides of authoritarianism before. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=71.2s)]
*  His book, The Reactionary Spirit, is great on the international perspective for this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=74.12s)]
*  And his recent piece says, it doesn't look like it's happening. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=79.0s)]
*  That Trump is losing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=83.84s)]
*  That if you think that what he is trying to do is consolidate a certain kind of power [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=85.0s)]
*  to fundamentally change the nature of how America works, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=89.16s)]
*  that he is facing the kind of opposition that does not look surmountable. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=92.92s)]
*  In The New Yorker, Andrew Morantz wrote a similar piece, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=97.68s)]
*  but from a very different place, from Hungary, where it already did happen. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, strong country, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=105.28s)]
*  run by a very powerful, tough leader, tough guy, best as I like, I'm crazy stuff. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=109.44s)]
*  And I've read a thousand pieces on Hungary at this point. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  But this one gave me this felt sense of the way in which, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=118.32s)]
*  when this kind of authoritarian breakthrough succeeds, it may not feel the way you think. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=122.32s)]
*  You can still be there in the opposition, saying the things you want to say in a nice fancy cafe, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=127.12s)]
*  drinking your Negroni, but the nature of your system is gone. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=132.56s)]
*  And while you've lost something fundamental, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=137.32s)]
*  you haven't lost the day-to-day texture of the world in which you lived. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=139.52s)]
*  And that's kind of why you didn't realize you were losing it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=144.12s)]
*  This conversation is not an attempt to answer the question. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=147.48s)]
*  We are not going to know what we are living through until long after it's over. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=150.32s)]
*  But it is an effort to check in on the moment. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=153.84s)]
*  Because what moment people think they are living through, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=157.08s)]
*  even in the time they are living through, it matters for the decisions they make [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=160.08s)]
*  and for what ultimately happens. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=164.88s)]
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at mytimes.com. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=167.24s)]
*  Zach Beecham, Andrew Marantz, welcome to the show. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=176.56s)]
*  Hey, thanks. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=179.04s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=180.2s)]
*  So, Zach, you wrote this piece arguing that, at least from a certain perspective, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=181.6s)]
*  Trump is losing, that he is not on track to achieve at least one version of his goals. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=186.4s)]
*  Right, a case for me. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=193.64s)]
*  So, the argument is that Trump's central goal of his administration, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=194.88s)]
*  he wouldn't put it in these terms, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=198.6s)]
*  but I think that it's sort of pretty fair to say that this is what their policies indicate towards, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=200.24s)]
*  right, is changing the American regime, right, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=204.6s)]
*  is turning what was a democratic government and has long been a democratic government [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=206.84s)]
*  into some species of non-democratic government [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=210.4s)]
*  in which power is wielded primarily through the executive with basically few checks. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=212.92s)]
*  And potentially even down the line, the fairness of elections is compromised. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=217.12s)]
*  And that means not just Trump saying that he is doing things to consolidate power, right, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=221.6s)]
*  but actually doing it, right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=227.2s)]
*  And so I think that you can use a series of benchmarks. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  It's a brief checklist, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=231.68s)]
*  First is that I looked into sort of quantitatively the court rulings against Trump. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=233.16s)]
*  And I found that not only did he lose vastly more than he won whenever there was an actual decision, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=237.04s)]
*  but in most situations, the administration has complied with the something like four to one ratio [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  of court orders where they've lost. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=246.84s)]
*  Look at the cases of the students that have been targeted, right? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  Courts have been consistently ruling in their favor, right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=250.76s)]
*  They've issued statements publicly saying we will never back off from defending what is right. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=253.68s)]
*  And it looks most likely, I think, based on the current legal trajectory, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=257.84s)]
*  that they're going to be released, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=262.4s)]
*  In fact, courts have ordered a significant number of student visas that have been taken away restored. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=264.84s)]
*  And the State Department has complied with that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=269.76s)]
*  So that's one thing, right, failing to consolidate institutional power. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=271.96s)]
*  A second thing is failing to neutralize sources of opposition. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=275.48s)]
*  And so I think the press is a really good example. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=280.20000000000005s)]
*  Like one of the first things that any of these guys does when they want to try to move towards an authoritarian state [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=282.12s)]
*  is suborn the press in some way, silence it, make sure there is an effective criticism coming out of the media. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  There are instances of self censorship by the media, of Trump putting pressure on media organizations. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  But on the whole, if you look at the media landscape in the United States, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=298.24s)]
*  there's no shortage of Trump criticism. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=301.0s)]
*  We aren't having the entire country turning into Fox News, right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=303.12s)]
*  And the third thing is civil society. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  And here, the thing that really changed my mind is universities, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=308.76s)]
*  Where you had at first Columbia basically doing whatever Trump wanted to try to get the threat of funding cuts, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=314.36s)]
*  federal funding dollars being shut off off their back. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=319.96s)]
*  But then it looked like Harvard might be about to do the same thing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, Harvard becomes the leader of the resistance, right? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=325.08s)]
*  They're organizing this thing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=327.56s)]
*  There's a compact among Big Ten schools that's been ratified by faculty senates in which they pledge, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=328.8s)]
*  basically they call it a NATO for mutual legal defense. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  If Trump comes after one of them, they'll all defend each other with resources. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=338.04s)]
*  There's a strategy group privately for Ivy League and other top tier elite schools [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=341.04s)]
*  where they're planning collective resistance against the Trump administration. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  This is not what happens when you effectively consolidate power. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=348.32s)]
*  And you can see this in a number of different spheres ranging from business to law. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=352.44s)]
*  So let me ask one other question about what you said at the beginning. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=355.56s)]
*  Because another interpretation is that we are being unfair to Donald Trump. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=358.72s)]
*  And he doesn't want authoritarianism. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=363.72s)]
*  That he wants the literal things he's going after. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=365.72s)]
*  He wants his concessions from universities because he or the people who work for him or advise him [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=367.96s)]
*  think they became anti-Semitic and woke. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=372.44s)]
*  He wanted to push the press on certain things, but he actually does not want to destroy the free press. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=375.2s)]
*  He's always said he will abide by court orders. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=380.32s)]
*  And as you say, largely, though not, I think entirely is that one reason it's not going the way you fear [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=382.47999999999996s)]
*  is that the model in your head, Victor Orban in Hungary or Modi in India, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=390.24s)]
*  is actually not the right model. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=396.32s)]
*  It is a hysterical resistance lib fear casting onto Donald Trump. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so I thought about this. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=404.08s)]
*  And it's unfair to Donald Trump. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=405.2s)]
*  No, I thought about this objection a lot while I was working on the piece. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=406.44s)]
*  Because, you know, Trump has never said, I'm going to be an authoritarian or like this is my grand-son. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=410.11999999999995s)]
*  He said he'd be dictator on day one. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  On day one. Just on day one. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=415.11999999999995s)]
*  And terminate the Constitution. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=417.76s)]
*  A little bit of dictatorship as a treat for his fans. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=419.28s)]
*  But Victor Orban doesn't say I want to seize control of the Hungarian government and make myself dictator. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=422.8s)]
*  Right. It's in the structure of modern authoritarianism when you're dealing with backsliding from democracy [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=428.56s)]
*  that they want to claim democratic bona fides. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. They want to be able to say I'm still ruling on behalf of the people. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=436.2s)]
*  Elections are still legitimate. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=438.92s)]
*  In fact, my legitimacy flows from my popularity. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=440.2s)]
*  So the way that you assess whether or not backsliding is happening is you look at the cumulative intent [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  of the different policies put together. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=450.68s)]
*  Right. What would the output be if these policies all succeeded? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=453.24s)]
*  Right. If Trump actually got what he wanted in these cases. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=456.96s)]
*  And we can see what that would look like. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  Right. It would look like a series of deals like the ones that Columbia and Paul Weiss made. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=462.52s)]
*  It would look like the courts declining to challenge him for fear that they wouldn't be obeyed in this case. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=466.32s)]
*  It would look like the media self-censoring. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=472.24s)]
*  I mean, we're on this podcast saying that Trump is an authoritarian and none of us are afraid [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=474.08s)]
*  that Donald Trump is going to shut us down because we were on this podcast. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=478.4s)]
*  Right. That to me is a significant marker of failure. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=482.35999999999996s)]
*  I think that the sort of are they losing thing. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=485.52s)]
*  I sort of have a few issues with it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=489.88s)]
*  One is just I sort of disagree with some of the particulars of the way we're accounting for the checklist. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=493.2s)]
*  Like, you know, the fact that they're losing court cases four to one. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=498.67999999999995s)]
*  It depends on what the strategy is. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=504.32s)]
*  If the strategy is to win every court case, then that's not a winning strategy. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=506.16s)]
*  I don't think their strategy is to win every court case. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=510.32000000000005s)]
*  I think there's a little bit of a heads I win, tails you lose kind of strategy where Trump has done a lot of losing of court cases in his life. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=512.52s)]
*  He doesn't really seem to mind it that much. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=520.44s)]
*  If he loses, maybe he loses partially. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=522.96s)]
*  Maybe it's a splitting the baby kind of partial victory. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=525.72s)]
*  And then he wins a few court cases and he can take that as a victory. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=529.08s)]
*  I think if you lose sight of the felt experience of what it is like to be an American right now and you just go to the checklist and you go to the norms and institutions, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=533.28s)]
*  I think you're missing a key part of it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=540.8s)]
*  Like, I can tell you the chilling of speech is working. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=542.16s)]
*  It is working. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=545.88s)]
*  Whether they lose every court case or not, people's speech is chilled. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=547.32s)]
*  Whose speech? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=550.96s)]
*  Students that I've spoken to. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=552.28s)]
*  Do you think the media is chilled? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=554.92s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, so. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=556.24s)]
*  See, I don't. Is the New Yorker being chilled? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  Blink twice, Andrew. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=561.0s)]
*  The New Yorker so far is not. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=563.12s)]
*  Well, this is another thing, which is where are we on the timeline? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=564.48s)]
*  Yes, where are we on the timeline? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=567.68s)]
*  If we're 100 days in, I mean, you totally could have gone to Orban's Hungry 100 days in and said, he hasn't taken control of the media. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=568.64s)]
*  It took him seven or eight years to get control of the media. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=576.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, if you had The Washington Post killing editorial cartoons and changing its editorial mission ahead of a new regime coming into office, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't say the media is totally cooked, but I would say that doesn't look great. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=591.2s)]
*  So, Andrew, I think it's always important to actually be clear on what is the operative metaphor happening in analyst minds. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=595.48s)]
*  And the operative metaphor, I think, in this era has been hungry. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=601.24s)]
*  You wrote this piece that I think exists in an interesting tension with Zach's where you went to Hungary and you spent a lot of time with the opposition, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=605.4s)]
*  opposition media, opposition figures. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=614.16s)]
*  You went to these universities that have been shut down, but they exist in this strange liminal space. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=616.24s)]
*  What emerged out of that piece for me was a felt sense that losing may not feel or look like what you think it feels or looks like. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=622.3199999999999s)]
*  Tell me about that trip. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  The felt sense was really, as you say, this liminal, you know, another term people use is hybrid regime and the hybridity, the ambiguity, the plausible deniability. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=633.88s)]
*  It's all around you. So, you know, you take the example of the universities. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=643.04s)]
*  One thing that one reads about Hungary is Victor Orbán didn't like CEU, Central European University. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=647.56s)]
*  He didn't like it because he was waging this kind of propaganda war against George Soros or the figure of George Soros, who was funding that university. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=654.64s)]
*  And so he got rid of it. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=662.12s)]
*  He kicked it out. And then you go there and you go to a building that says CEU on the front of it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=663.64s)]
*  And it has a big plaque that says George Soros funded this university. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=669.64s)]
*  And you walk in and you're in the university that you were told was kicked out of Budapest. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=672.68s)]
*  So right there, I was like, what's going on exactly? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=676.8s)]
*  And I was talking like you just said, I was talking to dissidents in the middle of Budapest, criticizing the regime and calling it autocratic. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=679.68s)]
*  And they weren't fearing that they were going to get stuffed into a van. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=686.12s)]
*  And I found this really actually confusing, but also instructive because I didn't then leave and say, oh, Orbán has lost. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=690.12s)]
*  He has failed to consolidate control. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=699.92s)]
*  I just thought, oh, what that means is maybe different than the notion I had in my head. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=702.92s)]
*  So it doesn't mean that in order to get rid of CEU, you have to raid the building, put a padlock on the door and sell it to, you know, become a barracks or something. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=707.32s)]
*  It means CEU is no longer a degree granting institution in Budapest. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=718.4s)]
*  So it's this kind of, I call it Potemkin University. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=722.52s)]
*  It's kind of hollowed out from within. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=724.84s)]
*  Then I come back to the US. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=727.12s)]
*  Trump is inaugurated and he starts going after Columbia University, saying there are all these foreigners here. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=731.72s)]
*  They have these strange foreign ideas. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=738.0s)]
*  We don't like it. It's too woke. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=739.76s)]
*  It's too anti-Semitic. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=741.52s)]
*  Interestingly, the way they use the trope of the international Jew is kind of different in Hungary and in the US, but, you know, same, same. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=742.8s)]
*  And then he starts levying these kind of informal attacks on Columbia University, but they don't take the form of an executive order that says Columbia University no longer exists. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=749.4s)]
*  He doesn't send in the army to raid Columbia University. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=761.8s)]
*  He says, because you're too woke and anti-Semitic, we are going to freeze these funds from you. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=764.6s)]
*  And I think if I had seen that through a lens of is this Iran in 1979 or is this 1930s Germany, I would have said, oh, it's not happening here. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=770.0s)]
*  But seeing it through the lens of competitive authoritarianism, I thought, OK, he's not going to get everything he wants. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=779.84s)]
*  He's not going to wipe Columbia University off the map if that's even something he desires. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=785.0s)]
*  But will he weaken it? Will he chill people's speech? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=789.6s)]
*  I think he already has succeeded at doing that. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=792.92s)]
*  What it really felt like reporting from Columbia University a few weeks ago was just this pervasive sense of fear and confusion about where the lines actually were, where formal and informal power was. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=795.8s)]
*  And that really reminded me of what it was like to be in Budapest. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=808.08s)]
*  There's this kind of invisible lines that are being made up as you go along. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=811.08s)]
*  So if you had told me on March 6th, I'm afraid to leave my apartment because I think jackbooted thugs are going to show up in an unmarked van and stuff me in the van. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=815.0s)]
*  And I'll never see my family again. And then when my wife asks where I'm going, they say we're taking him somewhere because we didn't like his political speech. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=825.4s)]
*  See you later. I would have said, you're insane. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=833.28s)]
*  This is the United States of America. What are you talking about? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=836.0799999999999s)]
*  There's no law anywhere that says they can do that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=838.88s)]
*  If you told me that on March 9th, after they did that to Mahmoud Khalil, I would have said, yeah, you're right. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=841.92s)]
*  You shouldn't go outside. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=846.56s)]
*  And this is something else to say on the piece, but that some of what is happening here is worse than what is happening. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=848.36s)]
*  There are places where you can say, well, they've not figured out how to consolidate control in the way Viktor Orban has. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=855.0s)]
*  There are also places where they're going much further with the power of the state than Viktor Orban seems to have dared. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=861.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think that's one of them. I think the disappearing of political prisoners for squarely protected political speech, that's more out of the Bukele or Duterte or Pinochet playbook than out of the Orban playbook. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=865.92s)]
*  And so it's a patchwork, right? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=878.4s)]
*  It's sort of it's not all of one or all of the other. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=880.68s)]
*  I mean, the Hungarians I spoke to were like, whoa, what is that? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=884.4s)]
*  We are not familiar with that, which was pretty shocking to me. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=887.24s)]
*  But also, as Zach says, in other pillars like the media, we're faring way better than they are. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=891.36s)]
*  Let me talk to you about that felt sense, because I think it's really important. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=897.5600000000001s)]
*  And let me lay out my own position, which I don't think we know what timeline we're in, because it is not coherent into a timeline yet. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=900.5600000000001s)]
*  It's too early. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=907.12s)]
*  We're in quantum superposition. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=907.6s)]
*  A lot of things might happen. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=909.32s)]
*  We'll see who opens the box. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=910.4s)]
*  One reason I take Zach's argument on this seriously, though, is that the felt sense of it has changed a little bit for me, for where we were three months ago. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=911.6s)]
*  One of the things that I've been watching for myself is does it feel like opposition is weakening or strengthening? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  Are people losing backbone or are they gaining it? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=930.32s)]
*  My impression, and I'm not saying my impression is right, is that they're gaining it, not losing it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=933.32s)]
*  That the view is that the law firms that folded are embarrassments, that they'll go down in history with a black mark, that the ones who stood up are looking better. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=939.76s)]
*  It's just a story the other day. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=949.24s)]
*  We don't really know what's behind it, but it is notable Microsoft moving some core work from one of the law firms that folded to one of the law firms that was fighting. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=950.72s)]
*  That struck people as an interesting sign. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=958.5600000000001s)]
*  Harvard looking a lot better than Columbia and sort of creating more backbone among other universities and the Trump administration coming out and saying, oh, this was a mistake. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=960.52s)]
*  Maybe we could just go back to the table together. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=968.04s)]
*  And when I look at the media, I was quite concerned about when you saw the settling of the defamation cases, when you saw what Bezos was doing, when he came out and said, well, we're going to have this free markets and individual liberties opinion page. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=970.52s)]
*  That could mean a lot of things, depending on how you defined it. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=986.8s)]
*  But you've not seen a purge of the liberal writers from the Washington Post opinion page. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=988.96s)]
*  I'm not saying there's not a lot to worry about here, but the thing that feels to me like it's happening. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=993.6s)]
*  Is there is more cohearing of like coordination among the administration's targets rather than less. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=998.52s)]
*  The students are completely different. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1007.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1008.92s)]
*  And you know, some of the. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1009.2s)]
*  But I'm asking, do you think as a felt sense, when you try to feel the zeitgeist of the moment, does it feel to you like the opposition is breaking its core or it's coherent? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1010.56s)]
*  I think you could, I mean, I'm with you that this week, as compared to a couple of weeks ago, the wind seems to be shifting in that direction. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1019.48s)]
*  But I think in terms of assessing which timeline we're on, I'm not sure that it's that material where the winds are shifting this week or last week or last month. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1026.32s)]
*  I think it's just too early to know. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1035.24s)]
*  So I think if we're on a timeline that is anything like competitive authoritarianism, the first year or two or three might be the period we should look at rather than the first hundred days. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1036.56s)]
*  Just so we have it on the table. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1048.92s)]
*  When we talk about competitive authoritarianism, how do you define that? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1050.52s)]
*  The competitive part means you still have elections. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1054.44s)]
*  They may be free, but not fair elections. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1057.24s)]
*  They may be heavily gerrymandered elections, but it's not the totalitarian thing where the tanks roll in and it's emergency law forever and you rip up the Constitution. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1059.64s)]
*  It's a more subtle thing that political scientists tell you is happening before you kind of realize it's happening. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1068.3600000000001s)]
*  So, you know, Orban is looked at as the model, the most successful consolidation of power. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1073.96s)]
*  He didn't get what he wanted right away. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1081.04s)]
*  He doesn't even get everything he wants now. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1082.44s)]
*  He could lose the next election. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1084.72s)]
*  I mean, maybe, maybe. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1086.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, he could. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1087.8400000000001s)]
*  But, but even on a micro scale, there was a radio station that he wanted to get rid of when he first came into office. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1089.24s)]
*  It was tied up in the courts until 2021 and then he finally shut it down. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1097.44s)]
*  So I think sure the fact that the wind seems to be at the back of some of the resistance stuff this week is notable and I think hopeful. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1102.2800000000002s)]
*  And to be clear about my position, I don't think it's like we're cooked and it's over. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1111.3200000000002s)]
*  But, you know, I think we have to be attentive to, I mean, basically what I think the goal should be is, you know, there's one of these great Orwell aphorisms that's sort of overused, but I think for a good reason. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1115.88s)]
*  Seeing what's in front of one's nose needs a daily struggle. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1128.76s)]
*  And I think to see things clearly, you need to not be writing backwards from the end of the story. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1131.72s)]
*  I want to pick up on the way anti-Semitism popped up here for a minute, Zach. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1136.96s)]
*  You've covered a lot of the ways anti-Semitism works in illiberal movements. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1140.12s)]
*  And the way it is working in this one is very strange. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1145.76s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1148.12s)]
*  But it's also the one end to become the excuse for a lot of what they're doing, right? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1148.8799999999999s)]
*  They need to, you know, break Columbia, break Harvard because of all the anti-Semitism. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1152.04s)]
*  On the other hand, there is this, you know, throw open the doors of X to neo-Nazis and a movement that includes many anti-Semitic or anti-Semitic adjacent people. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1156.7199999999998s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump at one point had dinner with Nick Fuentes. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1166.08s)]
*  You track this pretty closely. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1170.4399999999998s)]
*  How do you understand the sort of both the usage of anti-Semitism as a rationale and rise of anti-Semitic figures in that movement at the same time? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1172.52s)]
*  I mean, anti-Semitism has since, I mean, honestly, since the existence of Christianity, been a conspiracy theory. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1184.6799999999998s)]
*  Started with the idea that the Jews collectively killed Jesus and has become an explanatory framework for everything bad that has happened since. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1191.9599999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1198.9199999999998s)]
*  And in that way, it's, it's protean, right? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1199.6s)]
*  Because anti-Semitism can be adapted as an explanation for whatever bad thing you want to happen. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1201.6s)]
*  You can blame it on the Jews. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1206.6s)]
*  But we can also do is reconstruct the figure of who the Jew is and what they are doing in ways that are useful for your political project. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1208.16s)]
*  So it also centers on an old idea, but one that is Trump has explicitly appropriated the idea of there being good Jews and bad Jews. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1216.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1223.8s)]
*  And the good Jews are one that fit the dominant political characteristics and acceptable political characteristics at the time. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1224.12s)]
*  Right? Of this area. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1229.36s)]
*  You see this in Hungary, actually, right? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1230.12s)]
*  The there's a sort of there's an Orthodox community led by Chabad that's aligned in many ways with the regime. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1231.32s)]
*  And they get paraded out at events. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1236.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1238.2s)]
*  See, we're so tolerant. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1239.04s)]
*  We've made the country safe for Jews. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1240.32s)]
*  And that, you know, that figure of Jewish allies is really useful because anti-Semitism now after World War II, right? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1242.2s)]
*  Explicit racial anti-Semitism is a real no-no in a lot of places because of the legacy of Nazism. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1250.84s)]
*  Sounding like a Nazi is politically very bad for you. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1259.32s)]
*  It fractures your coalition. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1263.36s)]
*  It makes you look harmful. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1265.0s)]
*  And yet there are lots of Nazis who are in the or people who at least have Nazi aligned beliefs about race science, about Jews who are in the Trump coalition. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1266.8799999999999s)]
*  So they're playing a game. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1275.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1277.3999999999999s)]
*  And the game goes something like this. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1277.76s)]
*  It's we can use our opposition to the pro-Palestine movement and to the elements of those movements that are themselves anti-Semitism. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1279.76s)]
*  Anti-Semitism exists in all different political movements in different degrees. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1286.88s)]
*  And we can use it as proof that though we're associated with those people, you can't tar us with the Nazi slur that is so often directed at right-wing political movements. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1290.88s)]
*  In fact, we can appropriate the power of anti-Semitism as a justification for power grab. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1301.6000000000001s)]
*  And then the flip side of this, of course, is that these power grabs target institutions and even arguably the sort of entire liberal ideology. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1307.68s)]
*  That has been the cornerstone of American Jewish flourishing. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1316.44s)]
*  Andrew, what's your take on that? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1319.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think that basically sounds right. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1321.76s)]
*  And it explains how the figure of Soros or the international Jew is kind of used in different ways. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1324.0s)]
*  I mean, you don't have to look much further than Elon Musk doing what looked a lot like something that sort of seemed like a Roman salute. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1329.56s)]
*  And then, and then Steve Bannon doing it and then Steve Bannon doing it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1336.96s)]
*  And then Elon Musk at a different point when somebody was just offering extremely vile anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on Twitter. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1340.84s)]
*  You have said the absolute truth. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1347.6399999999999s)]
*  You can be a friend of Israel and be anti-Semitic. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1349.1599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1351.6799999999998s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1352.1999999999998s)]
*  Breaking that news here. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1353.0s)]
*  But I do think that it's important to have that framework. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1354.04s)]
*  It gets to this point of ambiguity, hybridity, plausible deniability. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1358.1599999999999s)]
*  What are you? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1362.6799999999998s)]
*  Are you anti the Jews or are you for the Jews? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1363.28s)]
*  You know, it cuts against this idea of a kind of clean, quantifiable checklist. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1365.8s)]
*  And also it cuts against the idea of, you know, did Columbia fully exceed and did Harvard fully join the resistance, right? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1370.76s)]
*  Before Harvard became the hero of the resistance, they adopted the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1379.12s)]
*  They kicked out the head of their Middle East study center. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1384.48s)]
*  All of this, you know, what Tim Snyder would call anticipatory obedience. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1387.6399999999999s)]
*  And then the administration pushed them too far, maybe by accident. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1391.24s)]
*  And then they joined the resistance. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1394.9599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1396.6799999999998s)]
*  So it's always hybridity all the way down, I would say. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1396.84s)]
*  Your first book was about the online, the rise of the online, what now is a MAGA, right? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1400.3600000000001s)]
*  And you have these great scenes of being on these neo-Nazi podcasts. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1408.0800000000002s)]
*  And there's a strangeness in the degree to which that is broken through, which I'd be curious to hear how you've absorbed. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1411.3200000000002s)]
*  So you have much more mainstream figures now, like Joe Rogan having these World War II revisionist historians on. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1421.2s)]
*  I've seen arguments, Madaglacius made this point that there is a generalized sense on the right that you need to question the foundational, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1428.32s)]
*  what they see as myth or rationale of modern liberalism, which is that the Nazis are bad and the worst thing that can happen is Hitler. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1436.32s)]
*  And in this effort to be completely uncensored, it's like, well, this is the last taboo and it needs to be broken. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1444.08s)]
*  What do you think is going on there? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1451.1599999999999s)]
*  Look, I used to we used to call it the alt right. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1453.36s)]
*  Now it's called the right. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1455.56s)]
*  And they are playing with taboos in ways that I think are multiple things at once. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1456.96s)]
*  Some of it is just, you know, the old fashioned troll, you know, can't you take a joke? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1463.44s)]
*  You know, this isn't actually what you think it is. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1468.5200000000002s)]
*  Or can't you take a conversation? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1470.44s)]
*  Can't you? Yeah. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1471.68s)]
*  Are you too scared to talk about taboo things? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1472.44s)]
*  Can't we just push the boundaries? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1475.2800000000002s)]
*  Right. Those things all kind of redound to the political benefit of the movement that is, you know, transgression and the thrill of forbidden knowledge is one of the most appealing things in the rhetorical playbook. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1476.5600000000002s)]
*  But it also, I mean, just to stick on the Hungary example, first time I did a reporting trip to Hungary was 2022 when they announced that CPAC was going to be held in Hungary, the first European CPAC. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1487.1200000000001s)]
*  And I first heard that and said, that must be a troll. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1500.6000000000001s)]
*  Like that's too on the nose. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1503.2800000000002s)]
*  You wouldn't have CPAC in the only authoritarian country in Europe if it's 2022 and you're trying to win reelection. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1504.64s)]
*  But they did. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1513.8000000000002s)]
*  And I went and there was this whole saga about whether they would let me in. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1514.48s)]
*  And they kind of, again, with the sort of gaslighting and the hybridity, they were like, sure, sure, we love independent media. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1518.4s)]
*  You can surely come in. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1523.44s)]
*  And then in the end, they didn't let me in. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1524.3200000000002s)]
*  And then I had to sneak in. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1526.2s)]
*  It was a whole thing. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1527.44s)]
*  But while I was there, Orban had just been reelected. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1528.6000000000001s)]
*  The resistance, the sort of popular front against him thought they had a chance to beat him and it turned out they really did not. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1534.4s)]
*  And one of his first speeches in Parliament, he did a whole thing about the Great Replacement Theory, which used to be this fringe alt-right idea that the international Jew, among others, are trying to engineer this whole conspiracy to let in these scary brown hordes and overwhelm majority white nations with invaders. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1540.32s)]
*  That used to be like crazy, crazy fringe 4chan stuff. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1559.44s)]
*  And over the time that I had been covering it, it went from the fringe discredited theory known as Great Replacement Theory to the thing Tucker Carlson is saying every night on his show to the thing Victor Orban is saying in Parliament to now the things that members of Congress are saying in the U.S. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1563.76s)]
*  Yeah, the righteous beliefs. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1579.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1580.64s)]
*  I want to go back to those disappearances, because this is a thing I thought about when I read your piece to Zach. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1581.6s)]
*  You know, the old William Gibson line, the future is here, it's just unevenly distributed? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1588.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1592.48s)]
*  I think one way to look at the moment is authoritarianism is here, it's just unevenly distributed. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1592.8s)]
*  That, yes, on the one hand, you can be you and me and Andrew sitting here on a podcast in the New York Times Citadel talking about authoritarianism, or you could be one of these kids at Columbia doing a pro-Palestinian protest marched into a detention center. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1597.24s)]
*  And there is this effort on the part of the administration, they, I think, want to gear up for mass deportations. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1613.56s)]
*  But before they've had the capacity to do that, what they're trying to create is a regime of fear. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1622.12s)]
*  And they're creating a regime of fear with tactics that are much more authoritarian, even totalitarian than I would have seen coming. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1626.68s)]
*  The photo of Kristi Noem, the Secretary of Homeland Security, at the El Salvadoran prison, with all these prisoners stacked behind her for the photo op. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1636.28s)]
*  Right, the usage of foreign disappearance as a tool of domestic fear. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1647.28s)]
*  Trump having that meeting with Bukele, saying that he would want to send Americans to Bukele's prisons. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1652.56s)]
*  It's just an uneasy tension with the idea that this is failing, because in some cases it's going further than you could have imagined, further than I thought they would have been able to or even would have wanted to. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1658.64s)]
*  Yeah, so I think that's exact evidence that they're failing. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1671.0400000000002s)]
*  In fact, that's the reason why they're failing. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1673.8000000000002s)]
*  So what they're trying to do is to make a show of exacting costs on dissidents. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1675.76s)]
*  And what that's supposed to do, right, is to chill dissent. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1680.24s)]
*  Only it's not working, right? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1683.2800000000002s)]
*  The people that they are targeting are coming out, they're winning in court, and then they're able to publicly say, we're not going to be quiet about this. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1684.76s)]
*  We're not going to stop. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1692.1200000000001s)]
*  That is what it looks like when these kinds of tactics fail, when they're checked. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1693.76s)]
*  They exist inside a system where there is still a meaningful degree of rule of law. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1697.64s)]
*  Had they done just what Viktor Orban did in Hungary, or done this all through very subtle, sophisticated legal machinations, right? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1702.72s)]
*  That would have been a more effective tactic. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1711.68s)]
*  But what happened is they make a big show out of it. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1714.8400000000001s)]
*  They send Kristi Noem to do these really disturbing photo ops. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1716.72s)]
*  They publicly abduct people on the street with, you know, masked men. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1721.0400000000002s)]
*  And when you do those things, you send a signal that what you're doing is authoritarianism. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1725.64s)]
*  What you're doing is terrifying. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1730.6000000000001s)]
*  And if you haven't consolidated control at that point, and you have a country that has really strong democratic institutions and a large section of the public, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1732.8000000000002s)]
*  that cares about those, you invite resistance. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1740.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1743.76s)]
*  It's, I wrote a piece that basically said there are two strategies in Trump's authoritarianism. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1743.96s)]
*  There's the Orban sophisticated, subtle strategy. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1748.2s)]
*  And then there's Trump's own desires, which is to be someone like Naib Bokele, who rules openly, does whatever he wants, iron fist kind of ruling. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1751.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1759.0s)]
*  Trump has openly proclaimed his interest in ruling like a dictator, not just on day one, but also admiration for things like the Tiananmen Square crackdown, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1759.1599999999999s)]
*  or he said a long time ago, and that these strategies contradict each other. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1767.48s)]
*  So the Orban strategy depends on self and subtlety. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1771.08s)]
*  And the Bokele strategy depends on massive, rapid, aggressive shows of force backed by the armed forces of your country. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1774.2s)]
*  The thing about Bokele, and I think this is important for something that you touched on a second ago, Andrew, is Bokele is popular. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1780.6s)]
*  He is overwhelmingly popular. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1787.08s)]
*  Victor Orban has been popular. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1790.36s)]
*  You mentioned a second ago him winning reelection at a time when the opposition thought it was massing an effective case against him. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1792.6s)]
*  Modi is hugely popular. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1798.3999999999999s)]
*  Modi is hugely popular. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1799.36s)]
*  The thing about Trump is that they are not, as best we can tell, conserving popularity or building on it. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1802.36s)]
*  There is a version of this. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1810.08s)]
*  I mean, Trump came in more popular in the second term than he was in his first. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1811.48s)]
*  He came in with allies he didn't have in his first term, and they are spending that popularity very quickly. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1814.48s)]
*  Some of it is on overreach like the, you know, a regular Garcia case. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1819.6s)]
*  But more of it is on a betrayal of this central promise of the Trump campaign, which is that things are going to be cheaper. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1824.12s)]
*  And Trump has lost public opinion, altruistic, very quickly. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1831.6s)]
*  Now he's not up for reelection. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1835.08s)]
*  But Republicans, I know, as far as we know, Republicans, not in the next election anyway, the next one is the midterms. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1836.8799999999999s)]
*  Republicans, I know, think they're going to lose the midterms. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1843.1599999999999s)]
*  They are not operating on the assumption that Donald Trump is going to save them. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1845.92s)]
*  People around Trump that I know have told me explicitly, we've got to do this fast because we're probably going to lose the midterms and then we're not going to be able to do as much after that. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1850.2s)]
*  Some of their blitzkrieg strategy has to do with a view that they are not going to consolidate power. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1859.5600000000002s)]
*  If you ask me what is strengthening the opposition to Trump, I would say it's the tariffs. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1865.2s)]
*  It's not the court cases. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1869.64s)]
*  It's not some invisible change in the winds. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1871.3600000000001s)]
*  It is a fact that Trump is alienating many of his supporters and the business community by lashing himself to the mast of an incredibly dumb economic theory and then seeming to double down and double down on it. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1875.6000000000001s)]
*  Coming out and saying, well, American kids have too many dolls. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1887.92s)]
*  You might have too many pencils. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1890.3200000000002s)]
*  My toilet is made of gold, but you have 30 pencils and you only need five. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1891.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, and so in that case, I mean, so to be clear, I would agree with Zach's broad point that Trump is not doing it the Orban way and that Trump is impulsive. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1896.16s)]
*  And that the tariffs hurt him. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1905.5600000000002s)]
*  And so I do, I think we all broadly agree that the laws of political gravity have not been suspended. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1907.2800000000002s)]
*  I mean, one of the important points that people made to me over and over again, while I was reporting this piece is even if you call it authoritarianism and many of the people I spoke to did, I mean, many of the political scientists I spoke to, including some of the, we spoke to some of the same political scientists. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1913.96s)]
*  They told me flat out America is currently not a democracy. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1929.44s)]
*  And yet in the next breath. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1933.6000000000001s)]
*  America is not a democracy. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1934.44s)]
*  Yeah, they did. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1935.76s)]
*  But I have a lot of issues with the way that that definition was right. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1936.72s)]
*  That was, we should talk about it. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1939.8400000000001s)]
*  We should talk about it. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1940.52s)]
*  When they say, well, let's hold there for a second. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1941.0s)]
*  When they say America is not a democracy at this moment, what do they mean? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1942.4s)]
*  Well, so it was interesting. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1945.44s)]
*  So Steven Levitsky, who was one of the coauthors of How Democracies Die, he also was a coauthor of this really seminal paper where he defined, he invented the term competitive authoritarianism. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1946.44s)]
*  I spoke to him and his coauthor on that paper, Luke Inouye. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1958.48s)]
*  And when I talked to both of them and I said, where are we on the map of history right now? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1962.52s)]
*  They said, we have crossed the line. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1966.52s)]
*  We are no longer a democracy. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1968.24s)]
*  They had written this piece called The Path to American Authoritarianism. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1970.0s)]
*  And they said, we are on that path and we are in fact past the line. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1973.72s)]
*  They didn't say we're past the point of no return because the definition of- [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1976.8400000000001s)]
*  But what is the line? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1980.72s)]
*  It's a little squishy what the line is. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1982.3200000000002s)]
*  To back up, one thing I said, cause I was thinking about metaphors and we were talking about, you know, where in the Schrodinger's cat of democracy are we? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1984.88s)]
*  One thing that I think is a real flaw in the metaphor is, you know, we're writers, we think about metaphors. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1991.8400000000001s)]
*  I think the death metaphor is really misleading because death is the only thing I can think of that is permanent and nothing else is permanent, especially in politics. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=1997.0s)]
*  So I was sort of musing about this to Levitsky and I was surprised at how quickly he threw his title under the bus. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2007.3200000000002s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, actually death is a terrible metaphor. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2011.8400000000001s)]
*  I shouldn't have called the book that. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2013.72s)]
*  Democracies don't die. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2015.48s)]
*  They can always be rebuilt. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2016.44s)]
*  He doesn't really believe he shouldn't have called the book that. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2017.48s)]
*  Everybody knows that title worked. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2020.1200000000001s)]
*  Pretty successful book. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2021.3200000000002s)]
*  Now, I mean, on your Brightline question, Ezra, they, Steve and Lukan and Dan Ziblatt wrote an op-ed in the New York Times where they laid it out, I think more formally, right? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2022.4s)]
*  Clearly what the criteria were, right? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2029.8400000000001s)]
*  And the argument is you have crossed the line from a democratic state when opposition has costs, right? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2031.8400000000001s)]
*  When people- [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2036.92s)]
*  When you have to think twice before you speak up and- [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2037.68s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2039.68s)]
*  And that's the Brightline. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2040.5600000000002s)]
*  Now, of course that Brightline is pretty fuzzy, right? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2042.0s)]
*  Like if you're a conservative, you would argue that in the quote unquote woke era, opposition to the reigning moral ideology had costs. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2044.72s)]
*  And on that point, you know, we were talking about we're sitting here in the Citadel and we're not afraid to call it out. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2051.16s)]
*  And that's true. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2056.4s)]
*  I will say, and again, these are very early signs because we're not far enough into the timeline to know. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2058.32s)]
*  No, the New Yorker has not been compromised and no free speech is not dead. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2064.48s)]
*  And yes, it does matter that we have a First Amendment. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2068.56s)]
*  I will say, though, when I was reporting up at Columbia, people were giving me anonymous information and they were saying, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2071.44s)]
*  we're actually sort of scared to give this to you because we don't know what all the harboring laws are. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2078.44s)]
*  We could be sort of making you an accessory to someone who's on the run from ICE or something. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2083.6s)]
*  And I gave the spiel that journalists always give, which is if you're an anonymous source, I will go to the mat to protect you. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2088.32s)]
*  We are willing to go to jail to protect our sources. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2093.52s)]
*  And when those words came out of my mouth, I said, how willing to go to jail am I actually? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2095.4s)]
*  That was the first time I'd had to think about that. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2100.28s)]
*  So I don't think I'm going to jail anytime soon. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2102.2000000000003s)]
*  But the fact that I had to think twice about it, I agree with this. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2104.0s)]
*  I have the same experience. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2106.36s)]
*  I think about things I didn't used to think about. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2108.4s)]
*  Am I going to get it? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2110.44s)]
*  But it hasn't changed my behavior yet. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2111.04s)]
*  Now, different people. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2113.36s)]
*  I mean, I think this is like the it's here, but unevenly distributed argument. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2114.36s)]
*  Different people are in different positions with this. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2117.7200000000003s)]
*  I know people who are writers, who are well-known writers, who are there things they will not write because they're on a green card. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2120.2400000000002s)]
*  If you are on a green card right now, you are living in a different world than if you were born here. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2127.4s)]
*  It's just true. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2132.12s)]
*  If you're here on a work visa, a student visa, you're living in a different world than if you were born here. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2133.36s)]
*  And there are ways that they are going after people who have power in American society too. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2138.2s)]
*  They have had these executive orders going after people like Miles Taylor and John Bolton, who were members of the Trump administration in the first term, who they feel were disloyal. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2144.0s)]
*  They're going after Letitia James, the New York attorney general, because she prosecuted Donald Trump. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2153.8799999999997s)]
*  So there are ways in which that they are trying to make examples of people, make life hard for them, use what money or control they have, use the machinery of the federal government. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2159.0s)]
*  And it's early. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2171.68s)]
*  Now, maybe that stiffens the spine of the opposition. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2173.08s)]
*  Maybe that infuriates people and it backfires on them. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2175.12s)]
*  But they are trying to make the opposition think twice. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2178.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, those are the examples I wish I'd brought up earlier when you were asking me about, you know, how do we know that this is what they're trying to do? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2182.12s)]
*  Well, it's exactly things like that. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2187.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2189.52s)]
*  Those that is evidence of authoritarian intents. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2189.7999999999997s)]
*  The question, though, and the reason why I don't like the framing of we've already crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism is that that implies that those efforts are having the intended effect. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2193.04s)]
*  And I do, Andrew, I take the caution that you're describing that we don't know how things are going to go. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2202.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2208.3199999999997s)]
*  In, you know, a year or two or something like that. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2208.68s)]
*  I don't I can't claim to know that what I'm trying to do is make a judgment about where we're at and what we can extrapolate from sort of the current trajectory of things. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2211.48s)]
*  And it's not just, I think, a couple of days or weeks where we've been seeing this momentum build against Trump. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2220.76s)]
*  It's it's it's over the course of months. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2226.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2228.6s)]
*  And certainly since the tariffs started. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2228.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2232.08s)]
*  Where that has really to your point earlier. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2232.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2234.68s)]
*  The tariffs have supercharged opposition to Trump because it's generated this level of public backlash. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2235.12s)]
*  Well, and so I think we can agree that the tariffs were a bad idea and that they will have a political cost and that generally people don't like it when you tank the economy and that that might cause them to lose the midterms. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2241.2000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, generally speaking, you always lose the midterms when you're in the White House. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2251.1600000000003s)]
*  But by more by more by more. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2255.52s)]
*  But then the question is really what do we mean by losing if they lose the midterms and if Trump doesn't get everything he wants. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2257.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2262.76s)]
*  If Trump doesn't get to be king for life and he doesn't get to hand the scepter and crown to Don Jr. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2262.88s)]
*  And he doesn't get his face on Mount Rushmore. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2267.2s)]
*  Is that losing or because I would argue that they've already not lost in the sense that. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2269.08s)]
*  OK, a couple of the students that they tried to put in jail have been freed. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2275.3199999999997s)]
*  Mahmood Khalil is still last I checked in prison. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2278.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't mean last I checked glibly. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2281.0s)]
*  I mean, like I checked yesterday and I don't know what happened today. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2282.3199999999997s)]
*  Then I don't think on the flip side that one should see as much alarm and hair on fire either everywhere you look. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2284.7999999999997s)]
*  But, you know, there's a little bit of goalpost shifting that I worry about where we'll say, well, what if something really scary happens like defying the Supreme Court? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2291.2799999999997s)]
*  And then we all watch on live TV as they sit in the Oval Office and defy the Supreme Court. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2298.9199999999996s)]
*  And we go, maybe in the future, something scary will happen. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2302.8799999999997s)]
*  Like, I don't know how much more. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2305.68s)]
*  So I think that's right. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2307.9599999999996s)]
*  But I think that's why it's actually worth being. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2308.7599999999998s)]
*  There are many things we can be talking about and losing and winning. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2312.0s)]
*  If you told me that what they're doing is they're in a mad rush to get as much of their agenda done as they possibly can before they lose the power to get it done in the future. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2315.2s)]
*  And that, yes, this will all be American institutions be affected by them. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2325.7999999999997s)]
*  They decapitated USAID. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2330.24s)]
*  They've decapitated the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2332.24s)]
*  But in ways that a Democratic president could simply rebuild it immediately the moment they got into office. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2335.24s)]
*  Right. That is different from. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2340.84s)]
*  They have structurally changed the flows of power, money, safety that allow for a fair election in the future. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2343.32s)]
*  But and this goes back to my piece, Don't Believe Him. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2353.44s)]
*  The question of what people think is happening actually does affect what happens. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2356.28s)]
*  Totally. Look, if they can roll through American society with Americans coming to the view that they cannot be stopped, then they will not be stopped. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2360.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. Whereas if people notice like, OK, when Harvard stood up. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2369.36s)]
*  They sort of backed up and like, I wish we had not made you stand up against us. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2372.6400000000003s)]
*  Like, maybe we could like go back to where we were a week ago and keep having that same conversation. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2377.4s)]
*  That's notable. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2381.32s)]
*  And so that's, I think, where it's meaningful. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2382.84s)]
*  Like, is what is happening in front of our face the consolidation of power or is it a flat out rush to get done what they can to get done before they lose power? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2385.6000000000004s)]
*  Those are those are what people think is happening will affect what is happening. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2393.92s)]
*  So I totally I agree that you don't want to. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2397.6000000000004s)]
*  I think. Don't obey in advance includes don't treat him like a dictator before he's a dictator. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2400.48s)]
*  And I think that's very important. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2407.28s)]
*  And it is also what I worry about when we talk about having crossed a bright line. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2408.7200000000003s)]
*  That's why I push back on the permanence of the death metaphor. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2412.32s)]
*  If we're talking about erosion or rebuilding, then it starts to be a little more clear. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2415.48s)]
*  So I actually if you talk about they lose the midterms or the next president is a Democrat, you know, you say they can instantly rebuild. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2419.48s)]
*  It's hard for me to see how we just go back to normal from here. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2429.7999999999997s)]
*  Part of what I worry about and part of why I worry that we're not plainly saying what's in front of us is the way in which. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2434.56s)]
*  The Trump regime has already gotten some of what it wants in informal ways, precisely because it's not agreeing to the consensus of, you know, it feels very vaporous to talk about norms and institutions. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2441.3199999999997s)]
*  And I am very much not into the norms will save us. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2453.92s)]
*  The courts will save us. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2457.88s)]
*  Like, I get all the critiques of that and I share many of them. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2458.8s)]
*  But to say that Trump doesn't have the formal power to do X, Y or Z, I think ignores the ways in which he's already done those things. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2462.52s)]
*  So can he disappear people? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2471.12s)]
*  Yes, he can. He already has. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2473.16s)]
*  Can he freeze and impound funds? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2475.36s)]
*  Yes, he has. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2477.88s)]
*  And you've written when he did those things. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2479.2s)]
*  I think he's been turned back on a bunch of this. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2481.2s)]
*  They're not sending a bunch more people to the El Salvadoran prison at the moment. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2482.72s)]
*  They've been like that authority got blocked for the moment. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2486.48s)]
*  They're not sending them back either. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2489.4399999999996s)]
*  They're not sending them back. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2490.6s)]
*  But there are policies you can achieve and then the policy is done and there are powers you are claiming. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2491.6s)]
*  But it does matter whether or not those authorities get entrenched. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2495.52s)]
*  Sure. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2499.0s)]
*  I guess what I'm saying is that can you use disappearances as a tactic is different than whether or not you've and I'm as fucking hair on fire about the disappearances as anybody. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2499.8399999999997s)]
*  I get it. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2506.48s)]
*  But what I'm saying is that whether they're entrenched, to me, is not merely a measure of whether they're written down on paper in a judicial order. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2507.4399999999996s)]
*  Whether they're entrenched also has to do with when you do them, what happens informally to you. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2515.7599999999998s)]
*  So all I'm saying is I don't think we're all going to end up in a gulag, but I don't necessarily think that that power is unentrenched because it is informal. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2521.24s)]
*  So let me back up. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2530.08s)]
*  There's this idea of political orders, right? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2532.64s)]
*  I know you're a Gary Gerstel head as am I. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2534.72s)]
*  Gary Gerstel has this whole notion of what a political order is. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2537.3599999999997s)]
*  It's this big hegemonic right. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2540.52s)]
*  So he has this notion that there was the New Deal political order, which was succeeded by the Reagan neoliberal political order. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2542.6s)]
*  It's not just, oh, people used to like Democrats. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2548.7999999999997s)]
*  Now they like Republicans. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2551.2s)]
*  It's the Reagan Clinton neoliberal order. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2552.52s)]
*  If anybody wants to get Gerstel pill and you can search in the archives of the show for our Gary Gerstel conversation before the election. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2554.56s)]
*  Great episode. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2559.7999999999997s)]
*  And so what I sort of see that political order thing as doing is trying to get outside, trying to get on a much bigger timeline. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2560.52s)]
*  And I sort of see, I don't know if Gerstel would cosign this. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2569.12s)]
*  I might be out on a limb here, but I sort of see it as like a structure of scientific revolutions of politics. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2572.24s)]
*  The structure of scientific revolutions where we get paradigm shift from. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2578.92s)]
*  It's not like. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2583.0s)]
*  Is it the book by Thomas Kuhn that coins a term paradigm shift? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2583.96s)]
*  The philosopher of science who, when he's talking about a paradigm shift, he's not talking about, oh, we didn't have microscopes and now we do. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2586.68s)]
*  What a paradigm shift. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2594.16s)]
*  That's really useful. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2595.48s)]
*  He's talking about ideas that are inconceivable, unthinkable, not allowed by like. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2596.2s)]
*  You don't even form them in your mind because they're unthinkable. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2602.48s)]
*  And so if you take that into the structure of political orders and how they shift. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2607.08s)]
*  Things that were unthinkable as an Eisenhower Republican or a Nixon Republican, you know, you don't just attack and defund the welfare state. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2612.72s)]
*  That's not how politics works. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2619.04s)]
*  Then after the Reagan revolution, all you do is different degrees of attack the welfare state. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2621.0s)]
*  Right. So. In that sense, if we want to talk about the timeline of what it would mean for Trump to be winning and reshifting, I think you said the constitutional order. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2625.64s)]
*  Part of what I think about is if the neoliberal order is cracked, as Gerstle says it is, then the question is what will succeed it? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2635.84s)]
*  It could just be that we just sort of muddle through with nothing to replace it. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2645.48s)]
*  And it's just what Gramsci would call the time of monsters, like indefinitely. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2649.44s)]
*  Or it could be. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2653.96s)]
*  Abundance. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2654.76s)]
*  Right. But so you need a vision for what will replace it. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2657.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. As you know. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2660.2000000000003s)]
*  The whole conclusion of the book is about political orders. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2661.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2663.6800000000003s)]
*  And so if abundance liberalism is what succeeds neoliberalism, that's an answer. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2664.2s)]
*  If Trumpist competitive authoritarianism is what succeeds it, that is an answer. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2670.8799999999997s)]
*  And in a way, this is like a little sort of weird to think about, but it may be the case that it's already happened and we just don't know it yet. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2675.64s)]
*  This is kind of the Schrodinger's cat thing. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2682.68s)]
*  I mean, when the rise and fall of the New Deal order came out, the book's introduction said the New Deal order is over, but we don't yet know what will replace it. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2684.84s)]
*  That book came out in 1989. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2695.88s)]
*  So we might be sitting here in a timeline where Trumpism has replaced neoliberalism in 2016 and we just don't know it. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2698.76s)]
*  Well, here's a way in which it has happened, which you've read a whole book about the rise of an international reactionary right. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2706.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2713.36s)]
*  And to go to Andrew's nice line from earlier, we used to call it the alt-right, now we just call it the right. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2714.24s)]
*  One thing that seems completely clear, there's no snapback to an old Republican party. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2719.64s)]
*  You look at 25-year-olds on the right. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2723.56s)]
*  They are completely bought into a very extreme version of this. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2726.4399999999996s)]
*  Like the rising generation of MAGA. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2731.2s)]
*  I mean, the guardrails are completely off. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2735.3199999999997s)]
*  So in that way, it seems like the competition now is between some form of liberalism and some form of illiberalism. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2739.04s)]
*  And that's definitely not going away. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2746.12s)]
*  And like maybe you survived this term, but then, you know, like how do you see that? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2747.56s)]
*  Well, like I agree that the current, the former parameters of American politics have been blown apart in the beginning of this administration. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2751.76s)]
*  The question is, are they doing something to effectively consolidate a new vision for the political order, as you suggested? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2760.0s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the way of going after the media, even within that first year, right, Orban had developed a new state-created conglomerate for different media organizations [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2765.88s)]
*  that effectively allowed him to begin exercising power over the media in a structural way that is not, there's no version of that in the United States. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2775.2400000000002s)]
*  There isn't even a concept of a plan here, right? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2784.32s)]
*  There's not a tool for power consolidation. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2786.84s)]
*  But to the immediate question about like, what is the future of the right? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2789.24s)]
*  I think it's true that these young, like among incredible cadres of young people, there's an obsession with figures like Bronze Age pervert, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2793.7999999999997s)]
*  Curtis Yarvin, people who have views that are explicitly anti-democratic, bigoted. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2801.2s)]
*  You know, there's a notion that it is interesting and fun even among these cadres to say things that are offensive. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2806.64s)]
*  And that irony has quickly bled into sincerity, right, where there is a deep faith and a sense that these things that they were saying to get a rise out of people are now true. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2815.36s)]
*  The question is, how much influence does that wield over the future Republican Party? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2824.44s)]
*  And I don't actually know the answer to that question because we don't know the story of the Trump era hasn't been written yet, right? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2830.2400000000002s)]
*  When I say things aren't going very well, let's assume they continue to not go very well. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2835.6400000000003s)]
*  We get to the midterms, they lose dramatically. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2838.96s)]
*  Then the administration starts flailing around in the next two years and a Democrat wins the White House and Democrats control Congress by an overwhelming margin. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2841.32s)]
*  Well, what does the Republican Party do with defeat and what does it do after Trump? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2850.88s)]
*  Because like we all act like Donald Trump is immortal, right, that he can't die. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2855.52s)]
*  And maybe he is, I don't know. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2858.6800000000003s)]
*  He, the man certainly has survived a lot, right? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2860.28s)]
*  And when Donald Trump dies, the glue that holds the Republican coalition together is gone. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2863.84s)]
*  This is a very common problem in authoritarian states, right? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2869.08s)]
*  The succession problem when so much is glued together. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2871.72s)]
*  And I think really, if you look at the details of the Republican coalition, a lot of disagreements are being papered over by the overwhelming charismatic force of one man. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2874.48s)]
*  And when he's off the scene, what happens to the right at that point? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2882.72s)]
*  And that's a very open question, especially in a world where his political project looks like it's a failing one, which may or may not be true in four years. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2886.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't disagree that there are fissures and tensions within the Republican coalition. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2893.52s)]
*  I mean, one thing about the BAP and Yarvin and all this stuff, they're not only the cadres are interested in reading them, but the chief ideologists in the White House are retreating them. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2898.12s)]
*  The vice president. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2908.92s)]
*  And not only is the vice president reading them, but he's saying things like, you know, when the Supreme Court gives us an order we don't like, we should say the justice has made his order, now let him enforce it. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2910.92s)]
*  So I think you could put together some worrisome signs. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2921.0s)]
*  I also think, you know, as well as anyone that the strength or weakness of the opposition matters enormously in this, too. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2923.6s)]
*  So in every place in India, in Hungary, in Israel, the reactionary right is able to rampage to victory precisely because of the weakness and division within the opposition. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2932.4s)]
*  So none of this, I agree, is foretold. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2941.7999999999997s)]
*  I guess one of the things I worry about is a kind of overly rigid reliance on the kind of playbook stuff like this isn't how it's supposed to be done, because I agree he's doing different things than what Orban is doing. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2945.2799999999997s)]
*  He's doing some bukele stuff. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2958.3599999999997s)]
*  He's doing some improvisation. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2959.9599999999996s)]
*  I just woke up today and thought of something weird and put it on truth social. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2962.2s)]
*  It's a hodgepodge of stuff. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2965.4799999999996s)]
*  I mean, Kim Laine-Cheppela has this term, the Frankenstate, where you can kind of Frankenstein a bunch of legitimate seeming things and make your own new form of an illegitimate state. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2966.68s)]
*  Now, I don't think anyone would disagree that Trump is not as patient and diligent and well-read as Victor Orban. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2977.04s)]
*  But, you know, Bolsonaro did a version of this in Brazil, and yes, he ended up getting defeated in the next election, but he came very close to rigging it in his own favor. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2984.16s)]
*  And Bolsonaro was not a disciplined, well-read guy either. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2992.92s)]
*  So there's different playbooks and you can invent new ones as you go. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2996.2s)]
*  Let me turn this question around, Zach. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=2999.24s)]
*  What if it began happening would make you write a piece? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3002.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like, oh, shit, maybe the timeline is changing. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3006.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, maybe it's bad. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3009.52s)]
*  Like you had said a minute ago, they don't have a theory of co-opting media. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3012.24s)]
*  There was a moment where, you know, it seems like MSNBC is going to get spun off in some kind of future sale, or at least potentially is going to get spun off in some kind of future sale of assets. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3016.52s)]
*  And you began to hear talk of like, would Elon Musk buy it? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3026.52s)]
*  And right, just hollow it out. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3030.8399999999997s)]
*  That's something you've seen in other countries. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3032.72s)]
*  The oligarchic allies of the president purchase media outlets and then turn them like towards the regime's goals. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3034.3199999999997s)]
*  He already bought Twitter. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3043.16s)]
*  I mean, he already bought Twitter and did exactly that with it. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3043.9199999999996s)]
*  Although I have a very strong view that Twitter is a net negative for the Trump administration. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3046.2s)]
*  But that's my that's my endless thing that political movements suffer for being too brainwashed by that place. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3051.24s)]
*  Not for not having enough power on it. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3060.2s)]
*  But that's a that's your eternally hot take. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3061.68s)]
*  Huh? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3063.64s)]
*  That's my endless take. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3064.04s)]
*  We all been on those sites. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3066.2s)]
*  Yeah, we know what the brainwashed. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3067.24s)]
*  Yeah, that the Democrats suffered in 2024 for having been so strong on Twitter in 2020. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3068.72s)]
*  They convinced themselves of a bunch of very politically dangerous things and they paid a price for it. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3074.3999999999996s)]
*  And this world in which Elon Musk and everybody are talking themselves into great replacement theory on Twitter. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3080.16s)]
*  This is a bad way to win over the median voter in America. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3084.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, you could make a version of the fighting the last war argument in precisely this context that the Democrats are learning that maybe they should have weighted Trump out more the first time and not done such a big visibly cringe resistance. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3086.8799999999997s)]
*  And so now they're trying to play dead more than they should. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3099.44s)]
*  I don't think they're trying to play dead. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3101.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't think it's a fair description of where Democrats are these days. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3103.04s)]
*  But let me let me put that to the side. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3105.7999999999997s)]
*  What would frighten you? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3108.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3110.3199999999997s)]
*  What what if it begins turning would be a signal? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3110.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3114.08s)]
*  So I think that to me the big thing to watch is where the Supreme Court weighs in on how on a variety of these different cases. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3114.9199999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3122.3599999999997s)]
*  Because for all Trump is losing in the lower courts the Supreme Court has the ultimate say in a variety of these things and there's a 6 3 conservative majority. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3122.56s)]
*  Now it's indicated that it's willing to challenge the administration in certain ways which is a positive sign. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3129.3199999999997s)]
*  But if the Supreme Court starts basically laying out the welcome for a variety of different Trump policies or clearing out the legal barriers that are in place. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3134.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that is that could be the single biggest warning sign. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3143.44s)]
*  Because then a number of these other things that seem like they're less likely to happen or there are significant barriers in their place all of a sudden become thinkable as actual real enforceable things over the course of time. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3146.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3157.1200000000003s)]
*  I think seeing more compliance from media organizations not just Elon Musk buying MSNBC which would be like the end stage of this but rather you know earlier stages more places seeing more self-centership from different people. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3157.4s)]
*  One thing that was true about Trump's reelection campaign is he built for the first time a MAGA coalition in 2016 he took over the Republican Party in 2024 he built his own thing. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3170.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3183.32s)]
*  It includes Maha right. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3183.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know exactly how we say that with R.K. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3185.3199999999997s)]
*  Jr. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3187.4s)]
*  But I think very very potently the tech right. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3187.72s)]
*  And my sense from knowing some of these people is that that coalition is under strain. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3191.64s)]
*  So Musk is still very allied but it seems to be stepping back from government because he might like light his Tesla empire on fire if he doesn't. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3200.64s)]
*  I'm hearing a little bit less from people like Mark Andreessen they've gotten a little bit quieter is my sense of them. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3208.44s)]
*  They're on the group chats. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3213.4s)]
*  They're on the group chats but also I mean the in Ben Smith's great semaphore story about the group chats you had this amazing ending where on one of these big group chats that had been a key. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3214.2400000000002s)]
*  I would call a key point of influence for the tech right to convert others. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3224.8s)]
*  The tech right got really mad at how people were getting mad at Donald Trump and you had like David Sachs and Tucker Carlson them leaving the group chat. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3228.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3235.36s)]
*  And I again I know some of these people got very Trump curious and my sense of them is they think this is going badly not for necessary reasons we do. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3236.28s)]
*  But they think Doge was a failure. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3244.6000000000004s)]
*  It didn't save that much money and just sort of did things kind of at random with a buzzsaw. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3246.6000000000004s)]
*  They hate the tariffs. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3251.44s)]
*  They think the tariffs are really dumb. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3252.44s)]
*  I'm not saying that the tech right becomes a tech left. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3255.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't think that's where any of this goes. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3258.44s)]
*  But from that moment where you had the entire billionaire class assembled before Donald Trump at the inauguration to now something seems like it is under strain and contested again as opposed to he was able to consolidate it and make the alliance permanent. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3260.76s)]
*  Yeah this is this is where again I would sort of argue for a wider frame. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3277.6400000000003s)]
*  So like I think that the timeline can be broad enough that it can contain something like Trump losing some or all of the tech right without him being done for it. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3280.64s)]
*  You know for example I'm not saying he's done for no no but I mean even if we're just thinking about where this ends up. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3291.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3295.68s)]
*  Let's say he loses parts of his coalition. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3296.04s)]
*  Let's say he loses Musk. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3298.36s)]
*  That would be a big blow to him. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3299.44s)]
*  But you know you've written about Shumishka in Hungary out of that Hungarian words are famously hard to say so I'm sure I'm butchering that. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3300.88s)]
*  But you know the Musk before Musk oligarch who was one of Orban's biggest allies and then he lost him and he became an opponent. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3308.0s)]
*  And that was a blow to Orban but it was not at all fatal to him. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3315.32s)]
*  So I could totally see a story where the coalition is big enough and durable enough that it can withstand things like losing the midterms and it's already done things. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3318.96s)]
*  I mean you know don't forget we're already in a timeline where you talk about the Supreme Court. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3328.28s)]
*  We're already in a timeline where they wouldn't give Merrick Garland a hearing. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3332.64s)]
*  You know they see it you know again it's like if you heard about this happening in another country you'd say it doesn't sound super 100 percent democratic to me to not see your opponent and then see one of your own people on the Supreme Court. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3336.6s)]
*  One thing we know about John Roberts is he really wants to seem even handed. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3347.32s)]
*  So if you if you take a bunch of things to the Supreme Court that are just facially unconstitutional they're not going to hand you down smack down 9 0 decisions every time. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3350.52s)]
*  OK but let me make the other side's argument on this that actually that's just politics in the way it works. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3360.2799999999997s)]
*  Curtis Yarvin loves to bring up FDR and I don't think FDR actually makes any of Curtis Yarvin's points for him. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3369.12s)]
*  But one thing that I think is interesting about the way liberals remember FDR from this perspective is the Supreme Court is standing four square against the New Deal. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3375.2s)]
*  FDR threatens to court pack he loses that fight but seems to convince some key members of the court that they don't really want this confrontation and the court begins to turn around on some issues. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3384.4s)]
*  And we look back on that and liberals like damn good work FDR right like we ended the Lochner Court. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3397.08s)]
*  And so this I expect that the Supreme Court is going to give them some of what they want. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3403.84s)]
*  But a world in which they basically accept a negotiated bid for 20 percent of the powers they've attempted to take. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3408.6800000000003s)]
*  Without really changing any of the institutional structures of American life. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3416.92s)]
*  I don't know isn't that what kind of goes on all the time. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3421.32s)]
*  Well I would say it kind of is changing the structures of American life in the sense that it's how you get a new paradigm. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3424.7200000000003s)]
*  So part of what FDR was doing there was not just politics as usual it was battering his way to a new political order. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3429.56s)]
*  You know so I agree that the biggest challenge to all this is if someone were doing and someone conservative legal scholar said this to me while reporting the piece. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3436.96s)]
*  If someone were doing this on behalf of policies you like how much would it bother you. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3446.72s)]
*  I think that is the hardest question to answer and we can sit here and say we would be perfectly consistent and non hypocritical and you know who knows if that's true. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3450.48s)]
*  What one key point though is that yes you work things out in the courts you challenge the courts the fact that that is. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3459.52s)]
*  Option that's available to you to me doesn't put it outside the realm of competitive authoritarianism if Trump is able to break through to a new political paradigm and get competitive authoritarianism I think that is part of how he will do it. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3469.16s)]
*  He'll throw a bunch of stuff to the courts that says the 14th amendment doesn't say what it says and I know you said discrimination against trans people was illegal but I'm going to do it. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3481.48s)]
*  And on and on and on and on and on and if they let him get one out of those 10 things that is actually how you get competitive authoritarianism you throw a bunch of stuff at the wall and see what sticks and. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3491.2799999999997s)]
*  I agree that he's doing it in this flagrant blatant way it could be incompetence and impulsiveness it could be actually that that's part of the strategy but either way. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3502.0s)]
*  I don't think he's going to get it by amending the constitution I don't think he's going to get it by you know indefinite martial law I think if he gets it it'll be through stuff like this. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3511.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't agree actually I don't think that is how you get competitive authoritarianism how you get competitive authoritarianism if you look at any case where it happened. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3519.04s)]
*  Is through not just doing a bunch of random stuff right but through taking a systematic and deliberate effort to restructure the fundamentals of a society. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3526.72s)]
*  Right and getting key building blocks in place in a strategic way that allows you to wield power effectively you brought blog of Sumitra a second ago right that's a really instructive example Hungarian oligarch yeah that's right. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3535.84s)]
*  Who have not spent a lot of time in Hungary yeah like Andrew and I have so he was like Orban's friends right from from their days prior to power right this isn't a man like Elon Musk who developed his wealth independently his entire. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3549.6s)]
*  Business empire owed itself to govern in patronage right he had a media empire that was funded in large part through government advertising dollars so when he decided he had a break with Orban Samiska calls him a bunch of nasty names. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3563.7999999999997s)]
*  Right and what happens is Orban destroys him because Orban was pulling his strings the entire time he had control. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3576.84s)]
*  Overall he had control over the money of the control of the flow of resources all of which had been developed through years of systematic building right and power consolidation right laid on a groundwork of a super majority in the legislature right that they got in 2010 and have not relinquished since allowing them to do whatever they want to the constitution based on Hungarian constitutional rules. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3582.52s)]
*  None of those things exist in the US I don't want to peg this too carefully to the Hungarian example because you can say the same thing I mean my book is about the US Hungary Israel and India right and if you look at each of those cases. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3604.04s)]
*  Right there's a very very deliberate effort when it's successful using the reins of power in careful studied practical ways to get what you want and the problem with Trump is I just. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3616.2799999999997s)]
*  I see no evidence that that's happening which is not to say that American society can buckle it's just that he's doing it badly yeah and doing really badly. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3628.96s)]
*  Look I mean I think what we can agree on is that every case is different we were not the Hungarian case we can't use a two thirds majority to rewrite the constitution. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3638.7599999999998s)]
*  But again you know this is what I mean about kind of writing to the end of the story instead of seeing what's in front of our nose. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3649.3199999999997s)]
*  Not enough who didn't win the fight over the judicial reform or bond loses fights all the time right we tell the story in retrospect as or bond the great genius who got what he wanted. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3656.7200000000003s)]
*  But we know that he loses fights all the time this is what's competitive in part about competitive authoritarianism it's still politics it's still a fight and so. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3667.0s)]
*  Look I I grant that every case is different. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3675.76s)]
*  But Bukele did it a different way Duterte did it a different way Bolsonaro did it a different way and ultimately when the history of this is written it won't be oh he didn't do it the right way it'll be did it work. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3679.92s)]
*  Well I would note that both Duterte and Bolsonaro are currently arrested. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3691.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3695.48s)]
*  Right and facing and facing charges and they didn't really do a great job at building a competitive authoritarian regime. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3695.84s)]
*  Well I think they did in the sense that look I agree with you that Trump won't reign forever the question is what's the wreckage you leave behind and we were talking before about how easy would it be to rebuild. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3700.52s)]
*  I don't think if you come in in Brazil or Poland you just rebuild right away and everything's cool I think it takes many many years to rebuild so if what we're talking about is can you do four years of constitutional damage and then leave I wouldn't consider that losing. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3711.68s)]
*  If you do accept the premise and I do accept the premise that we are in an inter-renium between orders we are in a very messy and deranging fight because there is no settled set of answers in American politics no settled set of questions that both sides take and sort of have agreed on the boundaries upon. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3726.1600000000003s)]
*  So. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3746.1600000000003s)]
*  When you think about the democratic opposition right now. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3749.0s)]
*  It is still processing in its own ways 2024 and it is learned I think certain lessons that are relatively consensus at this moment among its leadership. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3751.68s)]
*  Democrats had in fits and starts gone too far left they really really politically screwed up and substantively on the border right they got crosswise on. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3762.8399999999997s)]
*  Like trans edge case issues that they never should have allowed to define them right like trans swimmers and NCAA sports there's a set of things that I think they all believe but they don't know what comes next. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3774.64s)]
*  One thing that I have heard many people on the right say is look it's you guys who expanded the federal government's control of all these institutions. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3785.76s)]
*  It's you guys who made it so all these universities are so dependent on federal grants who built this gigantic nonprofit complex that was living off of USAID and you know NIH and so on money and I have leverage over all these different parts of society right what Christopher I think believes himself to be doing. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3796.36s)]
*  Is basically retracing what the liberals did and seeing how that is leverage for what he now wants to do he's just like it to him he has like a counter revolutionary following the revolutionaries. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3812.7200000000003s)]
*  Is there something about that or I see the other side in liberalism right now where they sort of want their own Elon Musk. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3822.16s)]
*  They want their own strong central leader not a strong man in the way that trump wants to be a strong man but there's a sense of like oh I need somebody who can come and break my own china. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3829.2799999999997s)]
*  Like what as the opposition tries to define itself not just reconstitute itself are there yet lessons for it to learn. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3838.48s)]
*  Yeah I mean before the show you and I were talking about liberalism so my political load star is John Rawls in his book political liberalism right and Rawls has this idea of an overlapping consensus people don't agree on everything important they don't even agree on everything that's an important moral thing in fact is his basic position is there are certain disagreements that cannot be resolved through politics that no one can resolve. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3846.56s)]
*  What makes a liberal democratic polity function is that we agree at least on how to resolve those disagreements right and the bounds in which those disagreements take place for instance that it's wrong to coerce people right to force them. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3863.84s)]
*  To act contrary to their own beliefs or to impose a vision of the good life onto certain people and I think a lot of the conflict in politics right now. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3878.1600000000003s)]
*  Is the result of the American overlapping consensus breaking down right and a lot of the disagreements between different factions right now are over who broke it and why right and whether or not it can be repaired so the Chris Ruffo position right I've interviewed Chris right and when you talk to him his view is the liberals aren't really liberals right they're leftist authoritarians and liberal clothing they are basically the ideological heirs of the liberal movement. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3886.8s)]
*  Right and they went about trying to impose their sort of Maoist left wing cultural agenda on the United States and I'm just trying to fix that right in that light Chris's project sounds almost Rawlsian right Ruffo understands himself strangely as a moderate yes that's right that is his self conception. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3904.72s)]
*  It's not true right it's it's it doesn't stand to the test of you know what he's actually done and in part because his diagnosis is really unfair if you look at the history of American liberalism or the American left the new left of the 1960s the Maoist radicals he's talking about did not win they did not win the war of ideas on the left. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3922.0s)]
*  As he assumes that they did but I think that if we're talking about what can happen next it is possible that what happens next is years of chaos one interesting parallel I heard when I was talking to Luke and why actually was Nepal where you had a bunch of different factions who had totally totally divergent ideas about the constitutional order. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3939.28s)]
*  Who would win elections and that there'd be radical policy shifts for years and so it was years of chaos that happening in the US I think is really a distinct possibility. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3952.8s)]
*  It's also possible that we get a consolidated competitive authoritarian regime I'm not again so conversation I've not been ruling it out just saying I think it's a very radical political system and I think that's a very radical political system and I think that's a very radical political system. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3963.1200000000003s)]
*  I think it's less likely but I think if we're to get onto the good path right we need to consider what it would take to rebuild a Rawlsian overlap and consensus on liberal democratic positions in the 21st century and I don't have the answer here I'm not sitting here like I can tell you how to save liberalism. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3974.16s)]
*  But I think the task should be stated clearly in this opportunity this interregnum as you describe it right if Trump ism is failing so I think it is that creates a possibility for a liberal revival. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=3994.0s)]
*  When you're working through the question of in which direction is this going you said you don't love the checkmark approach. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4012.32s)]
*  But we all need our markers along the path what are you watching what if it went one way would leave you somewhat more comforted that the system at a core level is holding even as Trump is scoring victories. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4020.1600000000003s)]
*  And what was what if it happened would make you think this is breaking and we are on this path that when you look back at you realize we were losing things we cannot easily rebuild. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4035.04s)]
*  Well one thing that a lot of people in Hungary were saying to me during the peace and then after the peace came out is. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4047.4s)]
*  One downside of talking about autocracy and strong men and all this stuff is that people often use it as an excuse to turn their brains off and stop thinking creatively and stop trying to have a viable and vital opposition. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4056.12s)]
*  So one is just how strong is the civil resistance how strong is the private sector public sector resistance another thing is you know is the emergency sort of slow rolling and gradual enough that we start to just say oh well. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4069.24s)]
*  He disappeared 10 people and 8 of them were sent back so the system is working the system is holding. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4085.44s)]
*  He merely got the universities to preemptively agree to some of his demands not all of them therefore the institutions are holding right so I would worry about a kind of shifting of goalposts in that sense. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4092.16s)]
*  You know. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4105.04s)]
*  An analogy I make in the pieces to climate change where you would think that at some point when enough of Canada was on fire and enough of the smoke in midtown Manhattan had reached the point where you couldn't go outside everyone would look up. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4106.76s)]
*  And lock arms and say the emergency is happening now but in fact that doesn't happen and so the main thing I worry about in terms of. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4121.4800000000005s)]
*  If we're in a slow rolling democratic emergency is that we never have a chance to all get on the same page about it and it continues being fractured and hybrid and weird. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4130.04s)]
*  I mean people I spoke to in Hungary they all had different timelines for when they sort of came to emotionally accept that they no longer lived in the democracy for some people it was very early but for a lot it was. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4140.679999999999s)]
*  2015 2016 2020 10 years in I talked to Stephen Levitsky about Venezuela he said opinion polls showed that most Venezuelans thought they lived in a democracy 10 years into the Chavez regime. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4151.32s)]
*  So one thing I worry about is just the collective felt experience of the emergency could be here and we never really get it. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4163.84s)]
*  I got to play stand then also final question is what are some books you recommend to the audience and Zach why don't we begin with you. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4170.28s)]
*  Well I cheated a little bit because I started with political liberalism and I think that if there is any way to get out of the crisis we need to begin in part by starting with foundational principles right and. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4176.0s)]
*  Political liberalism is I think a really important text here I think another book which I just started rereading Tom Lawrence I've been in Jerusalem. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4188.759999999999s)]
*  Not because it's sort of answers these big picture questions about what political systems are like but because it's a character portrait of one man's role. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4198.32s)]
*  In a vast machinery of horrifying political outcomes and seeing what I came in was like and seeing the parallels between him and contemporary functionaries. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4207.5199999999995s)]
*  In competitive authoritarian regimes on a personal level I found very revealing even if these governments are vastly different from Nazi Germany. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4218.88s)]
*  And I think for a third book Matthew Rose's A World After Liberalism right to give you a sense of what the capacity for a post liberal imaginary is like what a world looks like. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4226.400000000001s)]
*  When liberalism no longer is functioning has been replaced or what it could be what people want it to be in the future what our order might be. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4240.72s)]
*  I also what I love about that book and I do love that book. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4248.72s)]
*  Is that I in a way think liberalism never looks as inspiring as when viewed through the eyes of its critics like look at what they think liberalism is not the dry technocratic kind of exhausted thing it began to feel like. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4252.68s)]
*  But what they understood it to be and its power to be is really interesting liberalism in its photo negative is fascinating Andrew. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4263.72s)]
*  I'm so I am gonna break norms a little bit because this is a book that I just picked up and I'm not actually finished reading yet but I mean you know we're in a kind of post norm reality now so I figure I just picked this up a couple of days ago it's called melting point. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4272.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's a fascinating book and it's all primary sources. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4287.0s)]
*  And it just sets you down in the middle of history in this case it's the history of the early days of Zionism and the reason I bring it up in this context is there's one line that one of the characters says which is it's. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4291.320000000001s)]
*  It's never inevitable at the time and I just think in terms of putting one foot in the other seeing in front of seeing what is in front of one's nose I think that's something we know intellectually we don't know how the end of the story is written. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4303.0s)]
*  But it's something we need to remind ourselves what it feels like. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4315.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm another one also in that vein is actually a film I'm still here the Brazilian film there are six or seven years into a military regime a military junta at the point that the film starts and yet. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4318.24s)]
*  Their life feels very hybrid it feels very liminal they're going to the beach and playing volleyball and. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4332.76s)]
*  Their life is actually kind of beautiful and and then comes the knock on the door and so you know again I'm not saying we are going to have a military coup in America I'm just saying that. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4339.160000000001s)]
*  The felt sense of it is very unpredictable at the time that you're living it you kind of want to shout at the screen like don't you know you're six years into a military dictatorship. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4350.72s)]
*  But they kind of don't or they don't know what the informal rules of that dictatorship are even though they're in the middle of it. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4358.4800000000005s)]
*  And then last I would bring up the constitutional bind by Aziz Rana which is a really big and challenging book and I'm not sure I. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4363.48s)]
*  Even understand or agree with all of its arguments but I bring it up because you know one of the great book titles on this stuff is Astro Taylor's democracy may not exist but we'll miss it when it's gone which is. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4372.72s)]
*  Another great book and another great book and a really clever idea of this kind of paradox of we've never really had a perfect democracy. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4385.4s)]
*  And yet there are parts of liberal democracy worth holding on to nonetheless and I think Rana tries to do this with the Constitution it's a book that's very very critical of. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4393.88s)]
*  Excessive veneration and worship of the Constitution and yet he's able to hold on to. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4401.5199999999995s)]
*  Why it's important to hold on to the parts of the Constitution that can still protect the vulnerable and so rather than sort of a worshiping the status quo anti and saying it was all perfect before. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4406.68s)]
*  We can hold on to what we want to preserve while also not fighting the last war. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4417.72s)]
*  Zach Beacham and Jim Rantz thank you very much. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4422.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4424.92s)]
*  Thanks this is great. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ged_bdGix28&t=4425.400000000001s)]
