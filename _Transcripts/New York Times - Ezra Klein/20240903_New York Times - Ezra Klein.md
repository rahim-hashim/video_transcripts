Video Description: I feel that there’s something important missing in our debate over screen time and kids — and even screen time and adults. In the realm of kids and teenagers, there’s so much focus on what studies show or don’t show: How does screen time affect school grades and behavior? Does it carry an increased risk of anxiety or depression?


And while the debate over those questions rages on, a feeling has kept nagging me. What if the problem with screen time isn’t something we can measure?


In June, Jia Tolentino published a great piece in The New Yorker (https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/06/17/cocomelon-children-television-youtube-netflix)  about the blockbuster children’s YouTube channel CoComelon, which seemed as if it was wrestling with the same question. So I invited her on the show, and our conversation ended up going places I never expected. Among other things, we talk about how the decision to have kids relates to doing psychedelics, what kinds of pleasure to seek if you want a good life and how much the debate over screen time and kids might just be adults projecting our own discomfort with our own screen time.


We recorded this episode a few days before the Trump-Biden debate — and before Donald Trump chose JD Vance as his running mate. We then got so swept up in politics coverage we never got a chance to air it. But I am so excited to finally get this one out into the world.

# On Children, Meaning, Media and Psychedelics
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teE_NSmp9LY)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  And now for something completely different.
*  We recorded this episode right before the first presidential debate, and there has been
*  such a crush of political news since then that there hasn't really been a moment that
*  felt right to release it.
*  But I loved this conversation, and in a funny way, it's more relevant now given how much
*  the election has come to revolve around the reasons people do and don't have children
*  and the meaning of that choice.
*  So a few months ago, Gia Tolentino published a big piece in the New Yorker on Cocomelon.
*  Cocomelon, if you do not have a two-year-old, is a show that every really little kid really
*  loves, and every parent has a more complicated set of emotions about.
*  But it's something Tolentino wrote at the end that was what really caught my eye.
*  She said,
*  I found myself wondering if we'd be better off thinking less about educational value
*  in children's media and more about real pleasure, both for us and for our kids.
*  In a way, this is an episode about real pleasure, which is not what I went into it thinking
*  it would be about.
*  It's about the tension between pursuing pleasure, or what I might call meaning, and pursuing
*  the kinds of achievements we spend most of our lives being taught to prize.
*  Honestly, I think this gets much more to the heart of the questions people ask about having
*  children than all this political rhetoric about cat ladies and extra votes and tax rates.
*  And I don't think it's an accident that in this conversation, as we're trying to talk
*  about the value of what we can't measure against the value of what we can, we end up finding
*  ourselves in the language of religion, of psychedelics, of emotion.
*  These are questions where I think we've culturally lost some of the vocabulary that we used to
*  have to talk about just what it means to live a good life, not to have a higher income or
*  a better job, but what is a good life?
*  Gia Tolentino is the author of the great book of essays, Trick Mirror, one of my favorite
*  books about being alive in the age of the internet.
*  She's a staff writer at The New Yorker.
*  And as always, my email is Ezra Klein show at NY times.com.
*  Gia Tolentino, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you for having me back.
*  So you told me that you came to a new understanding of why you had children on your way to
*  tape today outside the Port Authority.
*  And you would tell it to me when we were on the show.
*  So why did you have children?
*  I was thinking on the train up here about that question, like, why did I have kids?
*  And I was thinking about my trepidation beforehand.
*  And you know, I feel like I bring back every conversation about children to a conversation
*  about psychedelics, unfortunately.
*  But the idea seemed scary and overwhelming in the same way that doing acid seemed scary
*  and overwhelming before I did it for the first time.
*  It was like, oh, this is going to last for so long.
*  There's going to be part of it that's so intense and so difficult.
*  And I didn't do it until I felt like I know that the person that I'm going to do it with,
*  I'll have fun with.
*  I can trust that I'm doing it in kind of like a safe and right environment where I will
*  get the thing that I want out of it.
*  But the thing that made me decide to do acid for the first time is like not dissimilar
*  to the thing that made me decide to have kids, which is like, I think it'll be fun.
*  I think on the whole, I think it'll be fun.
*  I felt that there would be real lasting kind of destabilizing kind of boundary dissolving
*  pleasure in it that would kind of scare me in the way that true pleasure kind of does.
*  And I really hadn't thought about it that neatly until you said that you wanted to talk
*  about this.
*  Like, I don't think I understood that really the thing that drove me to this was probably
*  me to a lot of things, which is pleasure seeking.
*  It's funny because I sometimes use the psychedelics and parenthood analogy, but I use it in a
*  very different way, which is people will tell me they're struggling with the decision and
*  they're reading the parenting books.
*  And I always say that to read the parenting books is it's like the difference between
*  reading about doing psychedelics and doing psychedelics.
*  And that the fun is not the point.
*  I have this discomfort with the discourse around fun and parenting as if the way to
*  measure any experience in your life is whether when you're filling out a time you survey,
*  you're having a lot of fun doing it.
*  When I've done psychedelics, I don't necessarily think they're fun.
*  Sometimes they are, but what brings me to them is meaning.
*  And I feel like what brought me to parenting or what attracted me to it, what made it seem
*  like not even a question to me was that I want meaning in my life.
*  What is a more fundamental sense of human meaning than continuing the human chain?
*  Well, I should say too, when I say fun, I think that's why I corrected myself.
*  What I think of as fun is it's much less like enjoyment and more like pushing the limits
*  of what I don't know can stand or am capable of.
*  I have a kind of arduous idea of fun.
*  Something that I long to do constantly is go to Antarctica and completely lose my mind.
*  That sounds like one of the most fun things I can imagine.
*  And so doing psychedelics, it is extremely challenging sometimes and not always fun,
*  but that is a specific kind of pleasure that the definition of which is very close to finding
*  meaning.
*  One thing that's very clear to me as your work has shifted towards thinking a lot about
*  parenting, I think since you've become a parent, is that you find it really interesting.
*  It's very intellectually generative for you.
*  I find that's true for me.
*  I think that the thing I always say to people about parenting that was surprising to me
*  is how interesting it is.
*  It was really undersold to me how just kind of it would focus my mind on things I would
*  have never thought of or never thought of at that depth before.
*  You've written one of my favorite lines about parenting and you wrote it in this piece about
*  Angela Garba's book and about your own experience hiring a nanny.
*  And you wrote, quote, we could afford to do this because a person can get paid more to
*  sit in front of her computer and send a bunch of emails than she can to do a job so crucial
*  and difficult that it seems objectively holy to clean excrement off a body, to hold a person
*  while they're crying, to cherish them because of and not despite their vulnerability.
*  Tell me about the choice of the word holy there.
*  You know, it's the only part of this is because the way I was raised deep in the evangelical
*  church in Texas, but that's the only word for it.
*  You know, it's we were talking about fun, we were talking about pleasure, and now we're
*  talking about this idea of the sacred, right?
*  And I think that for me, the thing connecting all of those is like some sort of submission
*  and disappearance into something, right?
*  Like it's the total submission to someone else's body really in your baby, you know,
*  that I found there's no other word for it.
*  And so their body's needs and to the mess of it and the yeah, there's no other word.
*  And it also feels the same way with the parts of parenting that are in fact tedious and
*  repetitive and so mundane, which is often the exact same stuff, right?
*  Like wiping a butt over and over again and like wiping spit up from somebody's mouth
*  and washing tiny little hands, right?
*  Like it's these things are so often tedious and they are holy and the thing that connects
*  them both like it's submission.
*  And I found that like the transcendent moments in parenting and the really like just objectively
*  boring ones, you know, where I'm like laying on the floor of my living room wishing I could
*  read a book instead of just like stacking little plastic eggs on each other.
*  It feels like the same project.
*  And I have found parenting really interesting.
*  And I think by the time I decided to try to do it, I figured it would be right, like figured
*  it would be in the same way that I was like no matter what, like as with my first acid
*  trip, I was like, no matter what, this will be interesting.
*  Like no matter what, this will be extremely difficult in a way that is interesting.
*  How could it not?
*  I think there's so much tension and energy and guilt in this connection between the sacred
*  and the mundane.
*  The sense that you often should be feeling you're so close to this transcendent experience.
*  You're doing the most meaningful thing and you're so bored or so tired or you so want
*  to be somewhere else.
*  What do you do when what you're trying to do is escape the thing you should be paying
*  attention to?
*  And it's such a profound constant experience in parenting, but also in life, right?
*  To be alive is also holy.
*  To be alive, to be able to experience this at any moment, right?
*  The possibility of connection, of experience, of just being in this world, it should be
*  so overwhelming.
*  And instead, I am staring at my phone.
*  I started laughing when you were talking about that because I was just thinking about, you
*  know, like my little baby is about to turn one.
*  And so it's like I just instantly thought back to, I don't know, days when she was like
*  four months old.
*  And you know those days when it's like 930 a.m. and you're like, I wish everyone would
*  go to bed.
*  Anyone ever have those days?
*  And I would feel when I had that thought, right, like I'd be tired from getting up in
*  the middle of the night, whatever it was.
*  And I was just like, can everyone just go to bed now so I can not speak and not do anything
*  and not learn and not play or whatever?
*  And I would have the thought like I'm abrogating my the whole purpose of being alive, right?
*  Like I could actually just enjoy this pushing the swing in the sunshine over and over and
*  over.
*  But instead, I just want to look at some dumb shit on my phone and you know, whatever.
*  And I don't know, have you ever had this experience?
*  I think back to when I was little, and you know, I would read books while I was on roller
*  skates.
*  Like I don't think that the quality of wanting to leap out of the texture of the present
*  is something that's specific to the smartphone era.
*  Like I remember, you know, I read in the bathtub, like I, you know, I just always you memorize
*  the shampoo bottles, like you're always kind of looking for a narrative to take you out
*  of the present.
*  And I remember that being something that was true for me as a really little kid, even as
*  I was someone and remain someone that like, I mean, I was very present and I did have
*  a great time all the time, pretty much.
*  But I do think that the way that the smartphone has sort of deformed and, you know, put that
*  desire like quivering in our pockets, like beckoning to us.
*  Like I was going to say, I don't know if this ever happened to you, but I have this sort
*  of symptom of this brain disease that's particularly troubling to me is like pre-kids back when
*  I had enough alone time to have like original thoughts, you know, more than once every five
*  months or something.
*  Like I would think something and I would have the sense of like, this is an idea that is
*  like shimmering with movement in some way, you know, and then it would be too much for
*  me and then I would be like, I can't, I can't deal with it.
*  Like I'm going to write it down and then I'm going to scroll for five minutes.
*  Like I would very frequently have that response and that terrified me even though I kept having
*  it and it sometimes feels to me not that we're turning away from the like a mess and the
*  wonder of real physical experience despite the fact that it's precious.
*  I kind of feel something within me sometimes that it's too precious.
*  It's too much.
*  Being present is work in a way that it's this like rawness and it's this mutability.
*  It requires this of us and a presence.
*  Like that is something that I have sometimes found myself like flexing away from because
*  of all the reasons that it's good in a weird way.
*  Do you have you ever, do you know what I mean at all?
*  I absolutely know what you mean.
*  In a million different ways.
*  I mean, I was a kid, why do I read?
*  I mean now I think it's almost a leftover habit, but I read to escape.
*  I read to escape my world.
*  I read to escape my family.
*  I read to escape things I didn't understand and I read because obsessively constantly
*  all the time in cars in the bathroom anywhere.
*  Because it was a socially sanctioned way to be alone.
*  And nobody would bother me because it was virtuous for me to be reading.
*  One of the things I was thinking about what you were saying that was we have, there's
*  more spiritualism in this conversation that I expected, but I'm enjoying it.
*  And it feels a little bit like our metaphors are shaped by different traditions, right?
*  I know you grew up deeply Christian and there's a sense in the way you think about it and
*  write about it.
*  The holiness, the all of all creation, right?
*  This sort of the external world that requires something of you.
*  A lot of my experience of this or thinking about it is shaped more from meditation and
*  mindfulness.
*  And so the thing that I was thinking about what you were saying that was what always
*  feels limited to me is my attention.
*  And a lot of the need to escape is a need to rest my attention and recharge it.
*  And what allows me to access the transcendence of my children of the world is honestly how
*  rested and how awake and aware I am.
*  I mean, I spent some time in a coffee shop before coming here to talk to you and I just
*  needed that time listening to music and reading so my attention could recover so I could be
*  present here with you.
*  So in that way, I think escape is under theorized that escape, it can be good or bad.
*  I think we have trouble with this question of are we distracting ourselves or are we
*  recovering?
*  Are we getting a kind of necessary contemplation so that we can come back and experience the
*  world and process what we've experienced and seen?
*  Or are we running from it?
*  Are we trying not to feel from it?
*  Are we trying to be anywhere but here?
*  Or are we looking for something, right?
*  Are we looking?
*  Because I think that a lot of what takes people to screens is like, it looks like escape,
*  but I think it's also pursuit.
*  A friend of mine was watching my baby when it was one of those like schools off, whatever,
*  teachers out of town, whatever.
*  And I was saying like, okay, before you put her down for a nap, like rock her in the rocking
*  chair, give her a couple minutes and then once you see the eyes blink really have each
*  dumper.
*  And they were like, oh, that's her phone scrolling time.
*  And I was like, yeah, that's her phone scrolling time.
*  Her brain just needs to, sometimes we're just putting our brain on the static signal.
*  I think this is a place where there's so much self judgment, right?
*  Are you escaping?
*  Are you recovering?
*  We put that judgment also on our children.
*  And this gets us to Cocoa Melon.
*  Why do you describe for someone who has never seen it, has no idea what that word means,
*  what is Cocoa Melon?
*  So Cocoa Melon is one of the most successful entertainment franchises of all time, like
*  not just for children.
*  And yet it's something that like, if you haven't changed a diaper in the last four years, you
*  probably have no idea that it exists, you know?
*  How to put this?
*  It's this, the backdrop of Cocoa Melon is that major children's animation companies
*  did not make entertainment for babies and young toddlers because this was seen as sort
*  of like unethical and kids can't really learn from a screen at that age, so we're not going
*  to do it.
*  And then YouTube was invented and then the iPad was invented and suddenly iPad parenting,
*  of which I certainly take part in, was instantiated as like the way that suddenly we were all
*  living.
*  I think half of two to five year olds have their own mobile devices, which again, my
*  four year old is one of them.
*  And then so just this land was wide open, this like pristine farmland of just millions
*  and millions and millions and millions of children whose attention could then be captured
*  and monetized.
*  And then you get all these things like people know Miss Rachel probably.
*  Hello.
*  Can you say mama?
*  Mama.
*  Mama.
*  Let's sing it.
*  Mama.
*  Let's clap it.
*  Mama.
*  Let's sign it.
*  Mama.
*  Mama.
*  Mama.
*  Mama.
*  Mama.
*  Mama.
*  Mama.
*  Mama.
*  Mama.
*  Mama.
*  Mama.
*  Mama.
*  Good job.
*  But then there were all of these nursery rhyme channels where you would get just sing song
*  nursery rhymes and kind of squeaky looking mesmerizing uncanny animation of just giant
*  bobble headed like eternally smiling babies and like perfect little worlds where the sun
*  is always shining and the parents are always around and it's rainbow popsicles and it's
*  fort building and just smiles and smiles and smiles and smiles and the same words repeated
*  over and over and over and over and bright clanging noises and like these things that
*  are torturous for adults but basically heavenly to whatever is going on in our babies' brains.
*  Cocoa Melon is like it's so popular that you know as of some time ago the daily viewers
*  were like 80 million daily viewers which is as many people as watched the 2016 presidential
*  debate between Trump and Clinton like and that's just everyday viewers and I think a
*  conservative estimate would be that it's watched for 200 billion minutes a year and it's just
*  you know all the more remarkable because many of those viewers are most of those viewers
*  are basically pre-verbal. I've learned much more about Cocoa Melon than I ever thought
*  I was going to.
*  There's something interesting in Cocoa Melon and I assume this maybe partially motivated
*  your inquiry into it. There are two of them I think really Cocoa Melon and Blippi but
*  we'll focus on Cocoa Melon that exist at this absolute tension point of children adore it
*  and adults hate it. There are other things adults don't mind right Sesame Street actually
*  they remember it, we remember it, I enjoy it. You can't really get that many kids to
*  watch Mr. Rogers now but if you can but parents like Daniel Tiger there's all kinds of stuff
*  that parents love Bluey I think in general parents like Bluey more than their kids like
*  Bluey but Cocoa Melon is this one where from a very young age your children go and I feel
*  like you could describe this two ways completely vacant or completely focused in front of it
*  It's either an experience of being totally filled or totally empty and I can never quite
*  tell which and parents just it drives them mad. Why this one? Why do you feel like there's
*  this like unfathomable divergence between what the kids want here and what the parents
*  want here?
*  Well I think as far as I can make sense of it it's that this is the first sort of like
*  Cocoa Melon ushered in a paradigm where children's entertainment is not configured as entertainment
*  but as just raw attentional capture and I think that that's why right like it's the
*  people that work on it or that worked on it they've been laying people off like crazy
*  despite these viewing numbers and the three billion dollar like parent company valuation
*  but you know I do think that the people that created are interested in providing like pleasure
*  and entertainment for the people that watch it but the project of this company is attentional
*  capture and obviously there's significant overlap between attentional capture and entertainment
*  but I do think that we can and now I kind of think we should meaningfully differentiate
*  them maybe especially for kids and I think that's why like I think you can feel it in
*  the sort of bones of the stuff and the reaction parents have to it you know like even like
*  Teletubbies like college students love like coming down from drugs and watching Teletubbies
*  like even like silly baby entertainment it can provide delight which is not saying any
*  of this has ever been pure right like it's children's television has basically always
*  existed as like an eternal toy commercial but even like GI Joe, My Little Pony is basically
*  you know way back Mickey Mouse Club whatever all of these things they were configured as
*  entertainment first and there's something about this that doesn't feel like it's configured
*  as entertainment first it feels like it's just eyeball capture like just mining attention
*  with a pickaxe into the parents eyes yeah.
*  How much do you think the parental anger at Coco Mellon and I will very much include
*  myself here is a kind of self-loathing though I love the line you said not not entertainment
*  but raw attentional capture and two things really jump out at me from that one is that
*  when you're putting 18 month or two-year-old in front of Coco Mellon you're usually doing
*  it for a reason you desperately have to get something done around the house their older
*  brother is sick you're on a plane right there's a reason you're doing it and what you're doing
*  is trying to create raw attentional capture if it did not completely capture them it would
*  not be certainly instrumental purpose you are using it for I mean they're too young
*  for entertainment really at least of in the way we think about in culture so one it's
*  like we have asked this thing to provide a service and we are mad at how well it provides
*  it right and then two there is this creepy analogy to ourselves I mean how much that
*  we absorb and consume is not entertainment but raw attentional capture how well does
*  that describe parts of Instagram or tick-tock or even television that we binge knowing that
*  it has almost no nourishment to it right but we just don't want to think we are asking
*  to provide an instrumental service which is make the time go faster and make me disembodied
*  because I don't want to be here right now having my holy life I want to be completely
*  absorbed in you know something else something outside of myself yeah you know so one thing
*  about Coca Mullen right it's not like you said they're not doing anything new it's just
*  that the audience is new right like it's I talked to former writers who were telling
*  me that they got a spreadsheet of all of the search words that toddlers were making their
*  parents type in on YouTube kids or whatever and they would write episodes to those search
*  terms right there's an extremely SEO targeted operation and everything that I see has been
*  algorithmically tailored to exactly what I want to be looking at as well you know and
*  I think I will say like I don't have that much screen time anxiety about my kids right
*  I'm like y'all have plenty of resources you know like you were creative class children
*  in Brooklyn like you are luckier than 99% of the global population like you're going
*  to be fine I don't care about your like specific like language I don't know like I don't worry
*  about screen time in a very specific way but I have a like a preemptive sorrow about
*  the way that like any ill can be instantly evaporated by putting my phone in front of
*  my toddler and letting her or it might not my toddler anymore like my four-year-old and
*  letting her text emojis to my partner all day you know like another one of my distraction
*  tactics I get the sense that you're going to be looking at screens so much you're going
*  to be doing everything that I'm doing but probably by hours and hours worse and you
*  like me are going to be unable to be just present without reaching for your phone after
*  a certain number of minutes probably right and you are going to your conception of what
*  is possible is going to be limited to what is presented to you on that screen and your
*  conceptions of what you want and you know I feel like all of that screen time anxiety
*  that I feel about her comes from my own sense that screens have already foreclosed a lot
*  of that you know negative capability in my own life.
*  I want to expand on a line you gestured out there when you talked about what are we afraid
*  of and this is one of the places your piece really connected for me I have this feeling
*  as I said earlier that we're under specified on what we want and what we don't want and
*  you're right when it comes to the shows we allow our children to watch we are afraid
*  of what exactly that our kids capacity for deep thought will be blunted by compulsive
*  screen use that they'll lose their ability to sit with the plain fact of existence to
*  pay attention to the world as it is to conceive of new possibilities that the group to be
*  just like us only worse and those all feel like things were we're afraid of and also
*  maybe that they will never know any different and I wonder about this right I mean my kids
*  like they will never remember a time before YouTube kids right they didn't exist in a
*  time before YouTube kids there's always been escape there's always been distraction and
*  the fact that it was not that good I think was important right and I have trouble describing
*  this and I have trouble then like making the distinctions based on it but it's like I want
*  my children to be able to escape the difficulty of reality I think it's important I do it
*  too but somehow I know when I do it in certain ways it's bad for me and when I do it in other
*  ways it's good for me like I don't know why it is bad for me to look at my phone and good
*  for me to read a magazine but it is and I can't put it on a chart for you can you not
*  it's because one is surveilled and the other isn't it right like I don't think I care about
*  the surveillance you don't but don't you think that's why one feels better than the other
*  you feel freer doing one than the other like you don't feel your choices being sort of
*  actively manipulated and shaped and constrained by like a you know an extremely bald like
*  profit structure like that to me feels like you said the the escape was worse but it also
*  was an escape right like we were in our books in the back of the car and nobody knew what
*  was happening and what we were reading except for us our parents would never know there
*  was no machine record of it whatsoever even like if we were writing right like if we were
*  doing the equivalent of sort of what is I think widely and rightfully configured as
*  unhealthy like the 11 year old girl on Instagram right like the way I was processing my life
*  in narrative or whatever where the way it was writing my life into its existence was
*  in a notebook where no one could see it and no one whatever profit from escalating or
*  distorting it or testing it against anything and so much of that seems tied for me to the
*  lack of silent invisible constant surveillance.
*  So and I mean this completely sincerely I love how much that doesn't resonate for me
*  at all because it means that there are that I'm having such a different experience of
*  this and so I want to have them both here because one I'm I'm so close to a phone vegan
*  I'm so unbelievably annoying about what I have on my phone so virtually nothing on my
*  phone even can surveil me at this point.
*  Do you not have a browser?
*  I have a browser but I don't use it that much except literally to look at Pitchfork music
*  reviews which is one of my favorite time wasting activities but I have a lot of you know like
*  I have the New Yorker app I'm unbelievably annoying as a person but for me the thing
*  that I notice about a magazine which I think is my favorite form of media like full stop
*  is there is room for me to get interested and absorbed and let my attention move away
*  from where I am at that moment but it is not so absorbing or so grasping that my attention
*  can't shift back that I've fully lost track of my body or my surroundings and I think
*  this is one of the things that I want to get at I am unnerved by how much we feel the need
*  to net everything out whether culture is good or bad to these very measurable outcomes about
*  school achievement or income in 20 years or teen mental health and it feels like we've
*  just lost the ability to make judgments based on sort of virtues and values about when things
*  are good and bad like whether it is better to read a book or look at TikTok irrespective
*  of whether that shows up into studies of educational achievement yeah exactly I feel like we have
*  lost self-confidence in making cultural judgments like for ourselves for society as parents we are
*  so achievement oriented I think you see this in the debate about John Height's book the anxious
*  generation that if we cannot show something on a chart it's like we cannot have the self-confidence
*  to make a judgment about it well I think you know I was gonna pitch you another possible reason why
*  the magazine feels different from the phone which is that you know I mean the phone it is always
*  entwined with usefulness and like your work email lingers I mean you are reachable to be useful to
*  someone when you were looking at your phone even if you're just reading the same book on your Kindle
*  that you would be reading off of it right like I think real pleasure you're not like there's nothing
*  quantifiably achieved in it like you are not just unsurveilled but you are not being useful to a
*  goddamn person you know except the person directly in front of you if there is one right or the
*  people the many people and that has to do with what you're talking about this sort of Emily
*  Auster asked you know not knocking her I subscribed to her sub stack like the reduction of everything
*  to like what does the data say and you know what are the outcomes and and that's the choice right
*  it's sort of a maybe like an intellectual inadequacy in my own life that causes me to to come back to
*  this but it's like does it feel good or does it not and we kind of I think we still know what feels
*  good and bad and I think that that's like as that's a good of a metric to judge anything on
*  for ourselves and our kids to some extent right I think that really helps me describe or realize
*  something I want to go back to what we're talking about a few minutes ago this question of what are
*  you afraid of afraid of for your children specifically and I think maybe that gets at it
*  the reason I like magazines and don't like my phone is not surveillance or anything else it's
*  it I feel better when I read a magazine there are a million reasons for that and I would probably
*  describe it as my attention is more collected and centered and stable afterwards and so I can then
*  attend to other things in my life better and with more joy but it's just I feel better I like it it's
*  more pleasurable and I think the thing that I worry about the thing that I'm afraid of is you
*  know I wanted to bring children into the world not because the world is perfect or it's but it
*  is beautiful and I want I feel like I got this gift of getting to experience it and I want them
*  to have this gift of getting to experience it you know in its wonderful dimensions and its whores
*  and I am worried that I have unleashed a set of technologies upon them and that we've done this
*  socially that is going to structurally and permanently degrade their capacity for that
*  experience in the way that I notice it degrading mine in the moment and I'm frustrated myself for
*  not being better at policing but them you know they're young and they're getting tuned and
*  trained and wired or whatever metaphor you want here and I think the thing I am afraid of is not
*  like their grades will be bad because they watch Ninjago or Ninjago it is that their experience
*  of the world will be thinner and more scattered because they will have been trained on these
*  hyper stimulating things that somehow absorb you at the same time they make you feel bad and that
*  will just become the sort of baseline of what attention is supposed to be like so they'll be
*  like us right like they will have their experience of the world curtailed by the desire to check a
*  device every however many seconds right like they they will there's just no doubt about it it'll
*  probably be a lot worse for them but hopefully like us too they will have found the things in
*  the world that they can be devoted to in a way that supersedes at least a certain amount of time
*  the screen right like we the only way that I see out of this for my children is the same the only
*  way that I see out of this for myself is like I can't be disciplined I can't spend X amount of
*  minutes less per day on my phone because I know it's bad for me how much I'm on there already I
*  can't like it's it's only when the real physical world is brighter and more colorful and full of
*  surprises and you know luckily I found something that holds my attention more than phones do I
*  found you know a certain set of things that you know psychedelics well certainly psychedelics
*  going out dancing being you know face-to-face with a friend across you know like reading writing
*  right listening to music like actually this extremely limited set of things that are more
*  mesmerizing to me and more pleasurable to me than the than the screen that's and that's like one of
*  my very few concrete hopes that I have for my kids is that they find something that makes though
*  the world's dimensions enlarge in a way that overmatches what however the world enlarges or
*  seems to enlarge through a screen I want to get at how you're getting there because I think
*  there's something very deep in this question between attending to pleasure or attending to
*  some joyful or meaningful dimension of experience and attending to you know some of these these
*  other ends you talk in the piece about a researcher and this is to cast no aspersions on the work she
*  does which sounds both necessary and annoying who has done all this research trying to rate these
*  different children's shows according to how educational they are and so you have Daniel
*  Tiger and that gets a 2 it's a very weird 0 to 2 scale but you have something like Daniel Tiger
*  which is an offshoot of the Mr. Rogers cinematic universe which gets a 2 or maybe blue you probably
*  get a 2 you have some like Coco Mellon which gets a 1 not very educational but not like actively
*  meant to be harmful and frightening and then you have the strange underbelly of YouTube kids this
*  sort of computer generated AI animated often kind of horrifying like dream logic crap CGI and that's
*  like a zero and I was thinking reading that about what is implicit in the scale which is that the
*  best thing should be the most educational thing and I don't really believe that for myself I'm
*  not sure I believe it for for children but but I think there is this this question we face of
*  well what is our measure but what what for you helps orient the tuning fork both like for Jia
*  or for or for your children I think within this question and this calculation whatever I did in
*  my own life and whatever part of that calculation led me to the idea that having kids is going to be
*  a part of this pleasure seeking and it was indicative that the idea of pleasure had
*  shifted a little for me right like it wasn't the like pure hedonism of 12 years earlier or whatever
*  you know it was something that was deeper and harder and and more prolonged and and I think
*  part of it is like when I think about wanting my children to be oriented around pleasure and like
*  that's what my idea of a good life for them entails like it it also involves like them learning to
*  conceive of pleasure as the things in life that make them feel more human I guess maybe that's
*  one of the ways I've clarified it for myself right like the things that bring me pleasure are the
*  things that make me feel more human and not less I think it's interesting to say maybe we should be
*  searching for pleasure as opposed to achievement but that that also you know there's a lot of
*  things one might want right pleasure is one of them but but I mean achievement is a reasonable one
*  too and and then there are all these if you find pleasure in it right maybe yeah right or maybe not
*  right maybe pleasure isn't the the point of life or maybe I mean there's all kinds of things that
*  I do that I think are important or that I think are socially useful that I genuinely don't find
*  pleasurable but you don't find a kind of like hard pleasure in them like a hard sort of durational
*  you know what I mean like do you ever like these things that
*  have you not sort of like fooled yourself into sometimes somebody in the middle of a podcast
*  will just press on a point and be so sore that I have to spend a minute to be like am I really
*  going to go here I I will I'll say I guess this uh I am struggling with this question quite a lot
*  lately in my own life where I am so driven sometimes by internal pressure that things
*  that I think are pleasurable have been drained of their pleasure and literally this morning
*  when I was getting you know ready for my day like I just like have this note in my notebook about
*  the things I need to to do today I'm just like can you try to be driven by some by something other
*  than than this internal pressure when I began writing about politics I was a blogger in college
*  before blogs were like basically even a thing there was no thought of it being a career it was
*  done for nothing but a kind of pleasure right a kind of delight in being engaged in the world
*  and trying in some small way to understand it and even in some even smaller completely
*  inconsequential way to influence it and now that I have you know this much bigger platform
*  it's so much less pleasurable and so I think it's interesting that this idea you're you're
*  getting out of of expanding pleasure I think well back to the thing that you were talking about where
*  the researcher was coding stuff about what was educational or not and that was sort of the unspoken
*  good right I think it's definitely not coincidental that the things that were
*  coded as maximally educational are also the things that parents find pleasurable to have on in the
*  background and that it's not coincidental this stuff that was not educational is videos where
*  Minnie Mouse's head falls off and rolls down a mountain and that the middle ground was like
*  this sort of Coco melon Blippi thing that the like I think there's something about kids probably can
*  learn more when they are experiencing some sort of delight I hate Blippi like I just find Blippi
*  completely unnerving if you have never watched Blippi go enjoy yourself on YouTube but my kids
*  like it whoa and look at what you rode up on a police bicycle can I look at it of course you
*  can't believe it oh cool okay look at this a helmet wow this keeps you nice and safe
*  okay and oh look up here do you see that it's a light
*  beep beep beep
*  I do go back and forth a little bit maybe the reason they like it is that I don't like it like they are different than me they're not supposed to like what I like
*  it gets to this broader sense of structuring everything around education and achievement it's
*  like we're already thinking about this when they're two like everything has to be educational like
*  they can't put on pants like they can't put on shoes and already we are stretching out the tarp
*  of their consciousness across the scaffolding of the adult world right achievement and education
*  and are you bettering yourself and are you improving and I both get it but it does feel
*  like a transmutation of like what we've done to ourselves onto them at a younger and younger and
*  younger age just this movement of like a kind of what was once an elite adult culture right the sort
*  of self-improvement culture dale carnegie culture you know lifelong education to now it's like your
*  babies are supposed to be doing it feels odd well and I also think like to me it disturbs me less
*  because it is indicative of this like broader culture of optimization that I abhor and participate
*  in and find really pernicious and I'm terrified of how it might advance itself upon my kids like I
*  I'm afraid of that but it also nothing's educational at this age anyway like I've never
*  most of the co-comelan audience is not learning shit you know I was wading through a lot of
*  literature and research about this tiny little babies can process tv more than we think they can
*  but they can't really learn anything anyway and I think that absolutely the it feels kind of like
*  overtly like a veneer that everyone is just pretending that we can talk about what is going
*  to be good for them and what is like healthy and what is not while completely avoiding just
*  there's a big giant spotlight on what's on the tablet and the the whole world the whole world
*  and all of the ways that the actual world will change the trajectory of their lives is kind of
*  out of focus
*  so
*  the child psychologist allison gopnik and I probably wouldn't have brought this into
*  conversation except that we've already been circling psychedelics a couple times has made
*  this point she's at UC Berkeley there's been a lot of psychedelic research there and so there's
*  been this interesting cross-pollination in those departments and she's made this point that the
*  child's brain looks a lot like the brain of an adult on psychedelics so it really does it really
*  does you have a lot of you have a lot more disorganization in the the way the neurons
*  are connecting a lot more we learn as we get older to filter the world right and that's not just a
*  conceptual skill that's actually how our brains are organized psychedelics disorganizes the brain
*  which is why people make a lot of unusual connections and they're absorbing like an
*  overwhelming amount of experience because they're not filtering it out there are other ways to get
*  there too I remember when I came back from a silent meditation retreat I was so unable to
*  filter out visual information that I felt like I wasn't safe to drive because just trees were too
*  overwhelming but what is making me think about the reason I bring it up here is that both in my own
*  experience and and people I've known it's like people when they're they've had a psychedelic
*  experience when they turn on the tv at the end of it to kind of come to rest if they decide to do
*  that they tend to watch cartoons they watch Pixar they watch you know they don't go for um you know
*  thoughtful adult movies and I think there's some interesting analogy to that in this conversation
*  about children's shows like if a child's brain is more psychedelic more disorganized more open
*  then in the same way that adults who've gone through those experiences want something more
*  colorful beautiful safe etc that their orientation may be in that direction too like you know maybe
*  there's something valuable in it right like at the end of that experience I don't want
*  something highly educational and in the experience a two-year-old is is having like wide-eyed in this
*  completely overwhelming world maybe they don't and shouldn't I think that's why like but it comes
*  down to pleasure I'm also I once did an iconic three movie come downstream of I think it was
*  like Ponyo then Pocahontas then Bambi or something you know and I was like this is living you know
*  this is pre-kids but um I think that the idea that anything kids watch should be one thing or
*  another I think we're both kind of in disagreement they're kids like let let something just exist
*  without a purpose maybe you know for a little bit but I also like for this reason I think that just
*  basic ideas of beauty and pleasure they're not that different from kid to adult I mean obviously
*  there are limits to this right like I was thinking about having a pacifier in your mouth all day long
*  or whatever but I think you know little children find the same things beautiful like they're you
*  know you we've experienced we experience this every day right like they are stunned by a leaf
*  like a beautiful flower like looking at an animal a picture of an animal thinking about a whale like
*  they're oriented towards these things that we most we get to most readily like in the psychedelic zone
*  but this is maybe an argument for kids tv we can maybe want it to just be beautiful and I think
*  we can want them to have an experience of beauty in a way that is not instrumentalized and has
*  nothing to do with achievement if you're going to be in front of a screen escaping or looking for
*  something or just zoning out like why not have it just be like legitimately delightful and you know
*  maybe Blippi is that for some kids but I think that I came out of thinking about Coca-Mellon for
*  months with that idea in my mind like I was like I think now that it might be a legitimate thing
*  for me to want them to be looking at beautiful stupid cartoons you know the same ones that I
*  would want to watch coming down from a hallucinogen. There's a way in which you manage what you measure
*  and I think the main way we have been taught to measure this or think about this question is
*  it's always called the screen time question right the question of screen time do your kids have
*  screen time yet how much screen time and something it feels to me like you're getting at is it that's
*  just maybe the wrong way to think about this entirely. I feel completely unbothered by
*  quote-unquote screen time when I am there with my kids right if we're watching the Incredibles
*  together I do not think that is any less good of an experience for them for almost any definition
*  of the word good than if we go to Target together or if we go to like we're just having fun together
*  that's a good experience. Do you think that we have just sort of lost the plot on this sort of
*  altogether maybe for kids and adults in sort of making this about almost like the existence of
*  the screen rather than the experience of the person? Yeah the experience of the person I mean
*  right so all of if you actually get into the studies on the actual effects of screen times
*  like it's it is like the the screen itself is almost a red herring right like the
*  people think about screen time as it correlates with achievement and verbal abilities and like
*  self-regulation and language abilities at grade level seven you know all these things that are
*  tracked longitudinally and the correlation is much more strongly between the kind of life the kid has
*  and those things right like we all kind of sense that it's not like the screen is not the singular
*  determining factor it's just that we put screens in use in ways that reflect the life of the child
*  holistically and the kinds of opportunities they have and the kind of household they're raised in
*  and the the freedom that they have to you know not be thinking about basic needs and to flourish in
*  these other realms that we call achievement. There are researchers that argue that children's
*  screen time use should be reframed as an indicator of parental distress you know what I mean? It's
*  the life that matters I think and I think that applies to us and our smartphones too you know
*  I always like when I was kind of required for one job or another to be constantly paying attention
*  to the news as it was like scrolled out on twitter all day long like I was glued to social media kind
*  of by requirement and I think the way I thought of it then was like this is bad but it's okay as long
*  as my real life is bigger than it you know as long as as long as I self-evidently always feel that
*  the physical world is more inviting to me than my screen then I'm not going to spend one second
*  worrying about my brain rot because there's nothing I can do about it you know like I think
*  as long as the world is winning out most of the time I think that's like a reasonable
*  it feels like a reasonable metric to me. I think so much of why parents hate cocoa melon is a kind of
*  self-loathing often born of a kind of fatalism it's like I don't like this but I'm doing it
*  anyway because other parents do it because I need it because I can't think of an alternative
*  because I don't have the energy to structure things differently which is I'm not saying this
*  is a thing true for other parents and not me this is a thing true for me and I think that one reason
*  I'm so interested in this conversation is that the conversation for kids feels not exactly but
*  in many ways like a miniature and clarified version of the conversation for adults and
*  weirdly we're better at having the conversation for kids because at least there we can imagine
*  making judgments about good and bad and about using paternalism and cultural pressure not that
*  many people I know are truly happy with their digital lives that they're in a constant state of
*  irritation and aggravation with themselves above all but there's something about the fact that
*  everybody else is there or feels like everybody else is there that makes it impossible to imagine
*  or effectuate a different reality even just for yourself even when such a reality is possible
*  I also think there's something about what you're saying where you do something on your phone and
*  it's unsatisfying and you're dissatisfied with the way that you're doing it but the smartphone
*  has become the repository for all possible dissatisfaction and yearning civic dissatisfaction
*  routed through the smartphone like social you feel lonely you go to the thing that's making it
*  worse right like it's I do think that we're kind of in the grip of the loop where the dissatisfaction
*  with the thing itself presents it as the answer right like if you if you lack money be a task
*  robert or drive for lift or deliver you know like there's there's a way that the phone
*  is the catch-all solution for any sort of discontent let's say someone is still using
*  twitter and they're miserable and they want to get off of it probably like they're still going
*  to be looking for a source a replacement that exists on the phone you know okay maybe not that
*  one but what about reddit you know or something like that what I think is so hard about that
*  is that what makes it impossible to have alternatives to a bad status quo
*  is the continued investment in the status quo but because it maintains like just enough staying
*  power like that is energy people are not being able to put in to creating things that are that
*  are different you know and I think there are things that are different out there are certainly
*  things that are different that could be imagined and again I think this ends up being true for
*  kids too like we are very social creatures and what everybody else does really ends up mattering
*  I mean kids see other kids in a restaurant and the other kids are allowed to watch a phone
*  during the meal and that makes it harder to resist your kids wanting to do that right I mean there's
*  this whole pressure about getting kids smartphones in school because their friends have smartphones
*  and again there is something so contagious about everything and there's something that is so
*  true in the way that the existence of something fairly totalizing or fairly central the fact that
*  you have to participate in it particularly if it's something that drains your attention and
*  creative energy the fact you have to participate in it at all or certainly if you have to participate
*  in it a lot it makes it that much harder for other things to emerge because they would need
*  to emerge in that same space with that same energy I had television growing up I don't think it was
*  terrible for me but I do wonder about how different it is that my kids can watch anything at any time
*  whereas like I was at least a little bit prisoner to what was on when you know including like I had
*  it easier I had Nickelodeon which had a lot of kids programming right you know I didn't only
*  have to watch it on the kids hour on network television I just with all these things it feels
*  like there's some balance that makes sense right some point where it's enough and not too much
*  enough escape but not too much escape right enough choice but not too much choice and just in a lot
*  of things it feels like we've to me like hit too much maybe that's just me getting old and I just
*  think like when I was a kid it was enough and now it's too much but I also think there has to be
*  conceptually too much has to be a possibility and maybe we've reached it well I think again I mean
*  you know it's like my my dumb ass keeps bringing this all back to pleasure but I think that feels
*  like that line right like when we were you know once you'd had enough of watching six episodes of
*  Pete and Pete in a row which I certainly did you know once you were feeling severely diminishing
*  returns you would walk away from this machine that was not watching you and was not altering its
*  behavior to get you to watch it more and we were able to do that we were able to have this like
*  kind of unadulterated physical cognitive instinct about what was the right amount of escape and what
*  was the right amount of engagement because we just followed what we wanted to do like
*  we weren't walking away from six hours of Pete and Pete because it was good for us you know we were
*  it would be better for our language abilities in the seventh grade if we did so we were just like
*  I'm bored I'm no longer getting pleasure from this I've actually not been getting that much
*  pleasure out of the last two episodes I'm you know I'm just going to go do something else for a while
*  I feel like every time I write about children's or anything any sort of media it's like everyone
*  has been having these exact same worries I was even thinking with this conversation you know the
*  the concept of Assyria? No. Okay so this is like there's a joke one of me and my friends have a
*  joke that it would be a beautiful name for a girl where it was this medieval conception of depression
*  that to me feels like exactly like what we talk about when we talk about smartphones I looked it up
*  on Wikipedia last night to make sure that I was and there was this beautiful description on
*  Wikipedia as Assyria of Assyria as a flight from the divine that leads to not even caring that one
*  does not care it's like this listlessness this disengagement from the world this like boredom
*  and then you start not even caring that you're so bored like this total inability to act upon
*  your life you know as with the example of like we walked we were able to walk away when we weren't
*  having fun anymore we didn't have the option of the tv just being like wait wait wait try these 45
*  other things I'll hypnotize you again in 45 seconds if you just give me the chance right
*  I can feel it interfering with my own ability to understand when something's fun and when it's not
*  and I think that I am worried about that with my children and I think that's one of the reasons
*  that I'm like the only the only way out is a set of experiences or desires that will
*  clean out and clarify your your radar for what is actually what actually feels good and what
*  actually doesn't and yeah feels good in any of the ways the meaningful ones the not meaningful ones
*  but it seems to me like one of the things that that responsive surveillance mechanism does is it
*  it mixes all of those things up so that even if you're no longer having fun on twitter there's
*  still some part of you that feels like you are just because of the mechanism itself
*  I think this is a place where the surveilled language and fear really does hit for me
*  surveillance it sounds so creepy and it is and it's part of it but I actually feel like it masks
*  the reason we give ourselves over to it because it feels good to be learned about we all have
*  experiences of the algorithms coming to know us or predict us and recommending a book we never read
*  before that actually was really great or music that we never heard before that brought us into
*  a whole new genre or a whole new artist that we would have never found on the radio necessarily
*  or tweets that we you know are glad we saw but it's that way of being learned so it is able to
*  continuously recommend things that are more and more alluring and it makes that experience of the
*  diminishing marginal return more distant right that place where it's like well I've already watched
*  two episodes of Pete and Pete I don't want to watch three that's a lot of episodes of Pete and Pete
*  instead it knows better what you want and is better at giving it to you it's why I'm I find I really
*  try never to leave my kids alone with a recommendation algorithm right youtube or anything
*  like that it's much scarier and where they end up is much worse but it is like learning them at every
*  second and like how to give them the thing they actually want that will keep them clicking and
*  again I think this is where cocoa melon feels weird I mean cocoa melon to bring it back to that
*  it's one of the first successes in children's television or video entertainment I guess you'd
*  call it that doesn't come out of television it comes out of youtube it comes out of recommendation
*  algorithms it's built around recommendation algorithms and I feel like it feels like
*  recommendation algorithms right it feels like it knows the kids too well it feels too tuned to you
*  know their short attention spans like the whole thing is just overly optimized and on one level
*  that makes it very effective as a babysitter or an intentional harvester or just maybe it's
*  you know better as entertainment for them but it creates in this very clear way because you're
*  watching it happen to a two-year-old this feeling of what it looks like when culture is built because
*  it knows you and it knows how to predict you and that's scuzzy feeling that we have in a vaguer way
*  I think with ourselves when we're older we get in this very intense way with them and they're younger
*  but it's the same thing in a way to me like all up and down the age ladder I also think that again
*  this is a thing where the thing that you get through the smartphone like like you were saying
*  this experience of being learned and being known very very deeply right it's like it's a really
*  human desire that has made this so effective as like a you know an addictive technology right like
*  we of course we want to be learned and we want to be known like that's so much of the entire
*  pleasure of being alive and or personally right like people we want that for good reasons but
*  but it's like yeah it's part of why cocoa melon and so much on the phone it feels frictionless
*  it's been designed for frictionlessness and I think that's part of I mean maybe this is helping
*  me understand how I delineate like good pleasure meaningful pleasure from meaningless pleasure
*  which is that I think there's friction in all real pleasure and in the kind of pleasure you learn to
*  get in the real world there's friction in it there is like true surprise and I think that when
*  someone is learning us in the real world when they're coming to know what we would like and
*  and they're seeing things about us that we don't even see right like all these things that the
*  algorithm is doing when another person is doing that for us they change us in ways that the
*  algorithm doesn't right like they that experience contains sharp edges in a way that the algorithmic
*  one never can and that's why it's almost the same thing but it's why the real world version
*  it feels infinitely more meaningful than Spotify learning what song I want to listen to next
*  because even as good as the algorithm genuinely has gotten at like giving me you know what I want
*  to listen to the total removal of friction and I think that's one of the reasons that all the
*  YouTube stuff feels just instinctively bad again like it's one of those things where maybe it's
*  easier to see with Cocoa Melon it's easier to see that the like sort of seamless micro-targeting
*  endless stream of giving you exactly what you want I'm certainly guilty of understanding
*  that it's good for my kids to have a little more friction in their life and not being just get
*  everything what they wanted a touch of a button and then me pursuing that as soon as they're in bed
*  this may be gets at another thing that I'm afraid of because one of the things I was thinking about
*  while you were saying that is I decided a couple months ago I'd sign up for a bunch of the AI
*  relationship apps right like Kindroid and Character AI and things like that where where these
*  language models are built to create a kind of AI you'd be friends with or a lover with or
*  it would be a therapist or whatever and I tried them out for a while and you know they're pretty
*  good now I mean they're good at texting what they write sounds and feels realistic I always
*  tell people they're much better texting than most of the people I know would it have fooled you
*  like it doesn't fool me yeah definitely it would have like successfully catfished you if one of
*  them had started texting you a hundred percent okay easily I would not have known it's not a
*  person but I never could keep myself coming back to them right because there was no meaning in the
*  interaction right so I've you know I've since moving to New York I've been making new friends
*  and and I was thinking about how you know one of the friends I made we text a lot just sort of
*  during the day and they're not interesting texts necessarily sometimes they are but it is meaningful
*  to me that he's giving me that attention back right the message of the text is that I am being
*  chosen for somebody else's attention it's a kind of meta text about a relationship that is emerging
*  and I didn't end up writing the piece on this though because I can see the character AI usage
*  numbers that are being released and this is a sort of AI system used much more by younger people
*  and they're logging in a ton of times a day and spending huge amounts of time on it so to go to
*  the point of what I'm afraid of right this question of the retraining for me who grew up
*  you know before large language models the kind of unkindness the what I would call the meaninglessness
*  of that interaction is very front and center right it's very noticeable but if you're younger and
*  your social dynamics are way less formed and your discernment of social dynamics is much less mature
*  and your choices are more limited because of you know who you know and how you can see them and how
*  you can be in touch with them maybe it actually doesn't feel that way or maybe you get trained
*  out of it feeling that way I do think you can lose the sense of and taste for friction and that that
*  is a loss and that it does foreclose forms of pleasure just as you were talking about
*  hugely I there's this like old Kurt Vonnegut thing where he was talking about like the pleasure of
*  mailing a letter and it's like how the whole point of it is not that like you're doing something
*  efficient the whole point of it is that you go for a walk and you like wink at a girl and you
*  you know pet a dog or whatever I I mean but yeah I get used to I used to pre-children I had a
*  years-long streak of never using Amazon and a personal policy of if it was within walking
*  distance of me in like downtown adjacent Brooklyn then I could not order it online I had to physically
*  go out and get it and I have backslid on all of this since having my second child like significantly
*  you know and it's also partly because the experience of having children wonderfully it is the source of
*  all that friction like it's sort of like back to what we were talking about at the beginning
*  I think that as our world orients itself increasingly towards frictionlessness children
*  can seem exclusively like a form of friction and then and that friction can seem exclusively like
*  something that's undesirable when in fact like I think my sense that I wanted some of this specific
*  kind was one of the things that made me think it would be fun and I do think that like a total
*  lack of impediment the ability to pick up and go anywhere you wanted the drop of a hat which is a
*  wonderful way to live which I'm not you know anyone who has it and wants it I'm jealous of you and
*  good for you I mean it's like everything that we've been talking about is those are values
*  that have been inculcated by the same form of ultra advanced capitalism that created the smartphone
*  and created all these things that make us so depressed in the first place and I think that
*  part of me wanting feeling ready to try to have kids four years ago five years ago whatever it was
*  was a sense that I wanted to undo these things in me like this sense of exceptionalism which
*  children really took out of me you know we were texting like about the thing where you're playing
*  with your kids and you're like I'm probably not particularly good at you know being the
*  horsey right now but the thing that matters to you is that I am the person being the horsey
*  the most common way I feel like I fail as a parent and it's the way I fail both my kids and myself
*  is by trying to really control and optimize the experience and treat it like other things in my
*  life you know we're going to do this at this time and then we're going to go here and you know you
*  got to get your shoes on by this moment and to your point about being the horsey or you know finding
*  some joy in submission like parenting is so unpleasant when you are when you feel like it
*  is a distraction from the thing you would prefer to be doing right like looking at your phone or
*  taking a nap or but it's also I think unpleasant when you are trying to treat it like other things
*  in in adulthood and and control it it's most pleasant for me when I have like the resources
*  inside myself and also the wisdom to just kind of be around they're running around and occasionally
*  playing with me and I'm sitting on the couch and occasionally playing with them and it's like you
*  could just do a lot less we've made parenting really really hard you know and we've put a lot
*  of pressure on ourselves as parents to try to do a great job of it and you know be achievement
*  oriented and the kids should be watching only educational shows and really they should be
*  watching no shows at all and there's a million things we've done that are not really anything
*  that the kids ever asked us to do right right they would like you to sort of be around a bit
*  more or you know a lot and and be attentive but also like not overtake their experience with your
*  own and like that's really hard like I would like to get better at that.
*  I think that people know this though I think that when I had my first kid the thing that I found
*  most difficult but now I think I've smooth brained my way into finding really pleasurable is that like
*  when you're with your kids at some point you just have to completely surrender to not
*  the time just really can't you can't really do anything else you know you are just gonna like
*  this is your weekend now you know this is what weekends are going to be like now and there's
*  like a removal of choice in that that is the thing that I was afraid of and I think a lot of
*  people are afraid of but also the thing that is like arguably the most freeing like I remember
*  also like I had read how to do nothing like right before right around and I was like yeah this might
*  be a shortcut to the the kind of outside the clock time you know where you are just not being useful
*  to anyone but the people in front of you this thing that I was trying so hard to to do in other
*  ways that now I have to do every single weekend whether I like it or not and I don't I no longer
*  feel that as a loss I'm realizing like I used to I used to think like oh I could have done so many
*  things with these weekends and now I'm like uh you know it's it's time to go to the playground
*  you know time to go to the playground again. We've ranged a lot here but but to go back to
*  in some ways like the article that led to this show if a kid watches an hour of Coco Melon a day
*  should you feel bad? Would you feel bad? No. Should I go on?
*  No I don't think so. I think that's a lovely place to end. So as our final question what are three
*  books you'd recommend to the audience? I forgot about this question until I was on the train here
*  and I was like okay I got to think about the last the last three things that I was just
*  texting people about because I really loved. Okay so I was extremely late to becoming Lonesome Dove
*  Pilled. I was like six months pregnant and I was on a work trip to Thailand and I had 48 hours of
*  alone time on the end of that work trip and I was like I this is the most important like the books
*  I bring are the most important books like this is the only time I'll be alone for 48 hours all year
*  you know and I was like I need to bring the perfect book like the book that will make me
*  feel like I'm a kid again will give me just this sort of wildly disproportionate emotional
*  attachment you know I want to be sobbing you know by the end of this book and I read Lonesome Dove
*  and it was all that and more. I have been Lonesome Dove Pilling many of my friends as the year has
*  gone on if anyone hasn't read it truly recommend it. I really like this book In Ascension that our
*  friend Max Reed recommended to me it's sort of if anyone is in the sort of Ted Chiang Jeff Van Der
*  Mir kind of thing it's like that kind of grounded beautiful enigmatic slightly schematic sci-fi
*  really loved it another one that I've been texting a lot of people about. The third one is When We
*  Cease to Understand the World by Benjamin Labatute one that I feel like I've been texting friends
*  about like every month since I read it. It's about scientific discoveries that bring people to the
*  brink of madness and there's a really interesting thing that goes on where the book starts off
*  almost entirely non-fiction and then ends almost entirely fiction and the gradations in between are
*  amazing. And I'll just note because you mentioned the last answer you said talked about reading How
*  to Do Nothing which is by Jenny O'Dell and I still think it's the best book about attention and
*  habits of mind in this era. I've enjoyed this so much. Gia Tolentino thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
