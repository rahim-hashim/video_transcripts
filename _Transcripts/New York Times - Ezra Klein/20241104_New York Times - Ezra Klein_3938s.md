Video Description: In 2010, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert held a satirical rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., called the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. This was amid the Tea Party movement. Political emotions were running high. And Stewart ended the rally with a speech slamming the media for stoking the country’s divisions.

“But we live now in hard times, not end times,” he said. “And we can have animus and not be enemies. But unfortunately, one of our main tools in delineating the two broke.” 

That rally has a Rosetta Stone quality to it now. Because what Stewart was describing has only gotten worse. Our divisions feel deeper and more dangerous. 

So as we enter election week, I wanted to have a conversation with Stewart about some of the arcs he has traced in American politics since he first hosted “The Daily Show” in 1999. We discuss how the media has become increasingly segmented and polarized in the past 25 years, how that has affected politics, how he understands Tucker Carlson’s political transformation and whether his own politics have changed.

Note: The Washington Post is one of several news organizations mentioned in this conversation. We taped this interview before the recent controversy at the Washington Post over ending its practice of presidential endorsements -- a decision made by the paper's owner, Jeff Bezos.

This episode contains strong language.

# Jon Stewart Looks Back With Sanity and/or Fear
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM)
*  So you go back to the tea party moment in 2010. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=0.0s)]
*  And in DC, the newest member of the Fox News team, Tucker Carlson, joins us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=4.2s)]
*  Tucker Carlson had only just been hired by Fox News. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=8.2s)]
*  He was just two years out from being employed by MSNBC. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=11.76s)]
*  Yeah, he just blew my mind by saying that. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=15.4s)]
*  Elon Musk was standing for Barack Obama. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=18.0s)]
*  From Comedy Central's World News headquarters in New York. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=20.6s)]
*  He got Jon Stewart then into his second decade as a host of The Daily Show. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=23.8s)]
*  And he and Stephen Colbert host a satirical rally to restore sanity and or fear at the National Mall in Washington, DC. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=29.0s)]
*  Comedy Central's Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert are bringing their shows down to Washington at the end of this month and planning a rally to restore sanity. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=37.6s)]
*  Is this a political rally or a big piece of performance art? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=44.4s)]
*  Unclear. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  We are going to do this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=49.6s)]
*  The forms have been filled out. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  So what exactly was this? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=53.2s)]
*  And Stewart gives this speech. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  We can have animus and not be enemies. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=58.4s)]
*  But unfortunately, one of our main tools in delineating the two broke. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=62.0s)]
*  This moment to me, it has this kind of Rosetta Stone quality. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=70.0s)]
*  When I look back now from the vantage point of the era we're in and the eras we've been in, it seemed like a joke then. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=75.2s)]
*  In some way, it doesn't seem like a joke now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=85.2s)]
*  In the years since the rally, Stewart has continued to track the media's tendency to amplify some of the worst, most divisive tendencies in American politics. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=89.0s)]
*  He's now back hosting The Daily Show sometimes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=98.2s)]
*  I'm excited to be back. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=101.0s)]
*  I'm very excited. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=102.4s)]
*  He's got the weekly show podcast with Jon Stewart, which is great. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=103.8s)]
*  So with very, very little time now before Election Day, I wanted to have him on the show to talk about his understanding of this arc of these decades, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=107.8s)]
*  what he has seen, the way he has seen the media, some of the figures in it change, the way he has changed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=117.2s)]
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at NYTimes.com. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=123.8s)]
*  Jon Stewart, welcome to the show. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=134.2s)]
*  Thank you, Ezra. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=136.2s)]
*  I'm delighted. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=137.0s)]
*  I'm delighted to be here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=137.8s)]
*  So can we go in the way back machine to the rally for fear and sanity and or sanity? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=139.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=144.2s)]
*  That's how many years? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=149.0s)]
*  We were all young. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=152.8s)]
*  We were all young and innocent. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=154.8s)]
*  Getting a contact tie. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=157.0s)]
*  That has a little bit of a Rosetta Stone quality for me that rally. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=158.4s)]
*  How did it come about? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=162.4s)]
*  How did you decide to do a rally? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=164.2s)]
*  I'm trying to think back. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=166.0s)]
*  I think what happened was this was at the height of Glenn Beck's 912. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=167.4s)]
*  It was getting America back to and he was doing these sort of oddly demagoguish rallies where he would go down to Washington and you know, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=175.8s)]
*  you would see like older tea partiers in lawn chairs sort of surrounding the waiting pool. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=186.6s)]
*  Now he brings you an effort to restore honor in America. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Glenn Beck. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=201.0s)]
*  Hello America. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=205.0s)]
*  And I think it came of that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=208.2s)]
*  I think I remember being on the phone with Steven and we were just laughing about it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=211.0s)]
*  And I said, you know, we should we should just go down there and and bang one of those out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=216.2s)]
*  I mean it was it was an entire clusterfuck like that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=220.8s)]
*  We really I mean as you could tell from watching it probably the preparation was not so I can remember. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=227.8s)]
*  It has been very hard to get clean audio from it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=235.0s)]
*  Yes, that's been a thing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=237.0s)]
*  That morning. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=240.8s)]
*  So Steven and I I was doing my show. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=241.8s)]
*  He was doing Colbert report. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=243.4s)]
*  So we didn't rehearse anything. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=245.4s)]
*  We didn't do anything. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  And that morning we were driving over to the mall early. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=247.4s)]
*  And you don't at that time you really didn't have a sense of if anybody would show up and we're driving in and there's just a shit ton of people pouring out of everywhere like oh what's going on? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=254.4s)]
*  And we'd only set up like two large screen TVs like that's pretty much all we had. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=266.0s)]
*  And so we sat in a little makeshift trailer with the roots Ozzy Osbourne the OJs and Yusuf Islam and walked through like we were literally walking those guys through the ideas. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=270.6s)]
*  So the roots are playing the songs and we're like Yusuf Yusuf Islam you're going to come out and do peace train. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=288.6s)]
*  And then Ozzy you're going to interrupt after like two bar stanzas with crazy train. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=294.6s)]
*  I'm terribly sorry. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=300.6s)]
*  Yusuf, Joe if I may. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=301.6s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=304.6s)]
*  I respect you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=305.6s)]
*  I love you but I am not getting on that train. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=306.6s)]
*  What? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=308.6s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=309.6s)]
*  What am I saying? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=312.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=313.6s)]
*  I'm saying I don't have a ticket for this train. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=314.6s)]
*  I am not interested in this train. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=316.6s)]
*  He's in the middle of a song. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=317.6s)]
*  It's a beautiful song. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=318.6s)]
*  You're not getting me. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=319.6s)]
*  And Yusuf is just looking at us like but peace train is a beautiful song. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=320.6s)]
*  Why would you interrupt? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=324.6s)]
*  The whole thing was bonkers. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=328.6s)]
*  There's something about that rally I thought a lot about in the years after because in some weird way after that, I mean maybe it was happening then too, the political coalitions kind of split into the aesthetics of sanity, institutions, systems. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=330.6s)]
*  In this house, we believe in science and the aesthetics of fear, conspiracy, rage, anger, a kind of nativist populism. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=346.6s)]
*  And you were beginning to see it, right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=356.6s)]
*  Glenn Beck was the weird thing happening on Fox News. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=359.6s)]
*  But when you were looking at the landscape then, what did sanity mean to you and what did fear mean to you in politics? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=362.6s)]
*  Well, I think it was, I mean, again, I'm trying to put myself back in the headspace of all that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=372.6s)]
*  I mean, all of it was kind of a reaction to and our show was a reaction to what I saw as kind of this at that point, probably 40 year project of rebuilding parallel institutions to the left. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=378.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=395.6s)]
*  So there was this idea, you know, people always talked about like your show, it degraded the discourse and, you know, poked fun at things. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=396.6s)]
*  And I'm like, do you have an AM radio? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=403.6s)]
*  Like I used to because I drove to a lot of gigs, you know, doing stand up to the, I don't know, your listeners may not know this show business is very glamorous. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=406.6s)]
*  A lot of times you would get in what we would call a rental car and drive to Rochester. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=415.6s)]
*  And then you would go to Buffalo if you were lucky. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=421.6s)]
*  And then all the towns in between Poughkeepsie's connected, you know, you'd hit the old vaudeville circuit. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=425.6s)]
*  But I listened to a lot of AM radio and the vitriol and I mean, nonstop fire hose of degradation towards anything left of I want to say Lyndon LaRouche. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=431.6s)]
*  But anything that left of that was ubiquitous. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=447.6s)]
*  So I saw that cleaving that that Roger Ailes sitting in the White House in 1972 or wherever 1973 or 1974 going, I will never allow what the left did to Nixon to ever happen again. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=451.6s)]
*  And so the right very smartly rebuilt their own institutions in their image, colleges, think tanks, media. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=465.6s)]
*  And they portrayed anything that had been the standard institution as wildly left wing and activist, even if it might not be, even if it just had the patina of, you know, notions of equality or or fairness. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=476.6s)]
*  You know, the kinds of things that just don't fly. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=493.6s)]
*  So you're describing the fear side of this. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=496.6s)]
*  I want to zoom you in on the sanity side, because I think that that gets us something interesting that happens around then. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=500.6s)]
*  And is a big part of politics, which is that was an it's imbalanced in a way, right? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=505.6s)]
*  It's it's not like good versus bad. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=511.6s)]
*  The sort of aesthetic that emerged, I think it emerged in media, too, at that time. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=513.6s)]
*  There is a lot in right wing media that is about fear. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=517.6s)]
*  And left wing media was not like we're going to attack the billionaires. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=521.6s)]
*  Right. Maybe it wants to do that. Right. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=525.6s)]
*  The Democrats have become this party. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=527.6s)]
*  How do you find left wing media? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=529.6s)]
*  That's totally fair. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=530.6s)]
*  But let me say Democrats, right. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=532.6s)]
*  The Obama era Democratic Party, the way the Democratic coalition is changing is not a class warfare coalition. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=533.6s)]
*  It is a coalition that is makes a big point about technocracy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=540.6s)]
*  You know, if we could just sort of come together and listen to the experts and look at the right charts. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=544.6s)]
*  I am part of this Ed Wong blog. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=548.6s)]
*  We'd all come to the right conclusion. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=550.6s)]
*  Could we just be sane about this common sense about this? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=552.6s)]
*  Could we, you know, it's kind of a pro system coalition. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=555.6s)]
*  And so in this weird way you develop, I think, this this new aesthetic and politics that you guys pick up on, it's not like, oh, the right wants to go to war against communism and the left wants to tax rich people. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=560.6s)]
*  It has this this other cultural dimension. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=572.6s)]
*  It's like the left are the experts. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=575.6s)]
*  We're smart. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=577.6s)]
*  We think about things. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=578.6s)]
*  The right are, you know, they're the heartland. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=579.6s)]
*  They're the real Americans. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=582.6s)]
*  They're tough. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=583.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=584.6s)]
*  And it's this whole other like slightly orthogonal, but I think now very dominant way that politics cleaves. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=585.6s)]
*  It is almost barely related to what people want to do. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=590.6s)]
*  First of all, I cannot tell you how often people just throw the word orthogonal at me. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=594.6s)]
*  Do you enjoy it or no? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=601.6s)]
*  Everywhere I get. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=603.6s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=604.6s)]
*  I don't know what it means. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=605.6s)]
*  Tell me what that means. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=606.6s)]
*  See, this is a problem with like the left wing coalition over here. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=607.6s)]
*  Sort of existing separately from right. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=611.6s)]
*  It's like a different like a totally different space. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=614.6s)]
*  So that's I think that's that's really a nice perceptive analysis of those Obama years. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=619.6s)]
*  I would probably go further and say that was the foundation of the left from I mean, I think that's what the Goldwater revolution was was more about. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=627.6s)]
*  You know, this idea that the best and the brightest, right, that sort of the Kennedy idea of we're going to get the best in the brightest and that's going to get us Vietnam, you know. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=639.6s)]
*  But I think in some ways what you're describing is that that original cleaving that I think Obama maybe represented, but is much more about that Kennedy coalition that came in and the Goldwater coalition that rose up to oppose it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=649.6s)]
*  Or I mean, Roosevelt to some extent, when you think about the New Deal and maybe that's what they would consider the original sin of the left and the right. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=658.6s)]
*  This idea that government will expand to help people, which which was a huge sin. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=663.6s)]
*  You know, the idea that, hey, wait, that guy's hungry. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=670.6s)]
*  What if we gave him soup and people would be like, what? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=672.6s)]
*  No, that is the the original sin of the left. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=675.6s)]
*  So the idea that the left is going to be the future. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=679.6s)]
*  And then you think about the original sin of the left. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=682.6s)]
*  The idea that, hey, wait, that guy's hungry. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=685.6s)]
*  What if we gave him soup and people would be like, what? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=687.6s)]
*  No, that is the that is the job of the sisters of the poor. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=691.6s)]
*  That government can't do that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=697.6s)]
*  But but ultimately that that's been the battle. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=699.6s)]
*  I want to play you a bit of your speech that day. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=704.6s)]
*  I was going back and listening to it and one thing that struck me about it. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=707.6s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=710.6s)]
*  This is a terrible, terrible nightmare that I experienced. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=711.6s)]
*  By the way, and the rally to resource sanity. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=715.6s)]
*  Here's what I think social media exists for. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=718.6s)]
*  Social media exists for people to remind you what they will never forgive you for. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=720.6s)]
*  Like that was no like what we thought was kind of a larf. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=726.6s)]
*  And we're going to have a fun day has turned into there's very little I can do even today that people won't come on. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=730.6s)]
*  So I get two things on social media in the comments section. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=737.6s)]
*  One is you're a Jew. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=740.6s)]
*  That's just kind of no matter what happens, whether I put out like this is a picture of my dog and like somebody's going to come in the comment, be like, why did you change your name, Jew? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=741.6s)]
*  And the second is I will never forgive you for that fucking stupid rally to restore sanity that apparently handed control of Congress to the Republicans. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=751.6s)]
*  You know, it sucks for you. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=762.6s)]
*  It has become the worst thing of all. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=763.6s)]
*  A text. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=765.6s)]
*  And that is how that is how we are treating it here. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=766.6s)]
*  You created a text. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=769.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=770.6s)]
*  So I want to play you a bit of your speech. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=771.6s)]
*  I'm very sorry. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=773.6s)]
*  But one of the interesting things about your speech there and about your show in that time, about Stephen Colbert, is it's it's not really about the right. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=774.6s)]
*  It's about the media. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=779.6s)]
*  So and the way that the media amplifies hostility and distorts relationships between Americans. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=781.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=787.6s)]
*  If we amplify everything. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=788.6s)]
*  We hear nothing. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=792.6s)]
*  And yet. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=795.6s)]
*  With that being said. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=796.6s)]
*  I feel good. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=800.6s)]
*  Strangely, calmly good. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=804.6s)]
*  Because the image of Americans that is reflected back to us by our political and media process is false. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=807.6s)]
*  It is us through a funhouse mirror and not the good kind that makes you look slim in the waist and maybe taller. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=818.6s)]
*  But the kind where you have a giant forehead and an ass shaped like a month old pumpkin. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=827.6s)]
*  How does that hit for you now? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=833.6s)]
*  There is very little in this world more unappealing than the sound of your own voice being at moments sincere or or also projecting. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=836.6s)]
*  Like it's very hard to listen to yourself projecting into a field. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=846.6s)]
*  So you you just it's like a bizarro campaign speech where you're like, oh, I it has the rhythm and tone and volume of a campaign speech. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=850.6s)]
*  But I'm talking about a pumpkin ass. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=861.6s)]
*  So there is a big idea at that time. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=864.6s)]
*  Barack Obama used to talk about this all the time. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=866.6s)]
*  Right. It's the subject of the famous oh for DNC speech that launches him to national politics, which is that, you know, you meet us a little bit. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=868.6s)]
*  You meet us as Americans in day to day life and we're complex. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=875.6s)]
*  We, you know, we're in PTAs and we coach little league soccer. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=879.6s)]
*  We worship an awesome God in the blue states and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=882.6s)]
*  We coach little league in the blue states. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=891.6s)]
*  And yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=894.6s)]
*  There are patriots who oppose the war in Iraq and their patriots who supported the war in Iraq. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=898.6s)]
*  We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=904.6s)]
*  And later, Twitter and the 24 hour news cycle and all the rest of it, it distorts us. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=913.6s)]
*  It's a funhouse mirror. We get pumpkin asses and I'm so sorry about that. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=918.6s)]
*  It's not the reference vivid image, right. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=924.6s)]
*  And that it's wrong. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=927.6s)]
*  And then on the other hand, as time went on, and I wonder sometimes whether the media was cause or effect here, right. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=929.6s)]
*  Politics begins to feel, I think, a little more not pumpkin ass. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=936.6s)]
*  But when I watch people in politics, when I watch Donald Trump, when I watch people acting in Congress now, I wonder to myself, which of us are the real us? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=941.6s)]
*  Right. It doesn't seem like always that our conflicts are so overstated that the enmity is a distortion. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=952.6s)]
*  Did you feel it is something that the media amplified and then it became reality? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=963.6s)]
*  Or do you feel like it's still not reality? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=970.6s)]
*  Well, it's probably not as black and white as any of that in terms of, you know, is it reality? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=973.6s)]
*  But I can tell you this. I mean, I live in deep maga country where I am. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=979.6s)]
*  And there's, you know, New Jersey is a blue state, but there are really red pockets. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=983.6s)]
*  And I live in one on a day to day basis. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=988.6s)]
*  So if you're telling me like, do I think my neighbors have an enmity and an unpleasantness that like I can't cut? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=991.6s)]
*  No, I don't. I don't think that at all. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=997.6s)]
*  I, you know, I have wonderful and meaningful relationships with people that and there's certain topics that you try to avoid. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1000.6s)]
*  And there are other topics that you don't avoid at all. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1007.6s)]
*  And you give each other tremendous amounts of shit for. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1009.6s)]
*  So and again, that's anecdotal, not data. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1012.6s)]
*  So I can't tell you what's what. I can only tell you my experience. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1015.6s)]
*  But in my experience, media has an effect. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1020.6s)]
*  It has a weight and it has an ability to warp perceptions. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1025.6s)]
*  You know, cable news to me was mind blowing. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1030.6s)]
*  24 hour news cycle is good for one thing. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1033.6s)]
*  And that's 9 11. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1035.6s)]
*  Like when 9 11 happens, you want that fucking station to be on all day and you want people and you want something because the world is so tenuous in that moment. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1037.6s)]
*  But in the absence of it, how are you going to keep people watching? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1048.6s)]
*  We have to in some ways impose kind of a contrived urgency or a fear. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1053.6s)]
*  And it's nothing new. It's just a question of degrees. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1058.6s)]
*  How many times, you know, in the olden days of Roger Mudd and eyewitness news, it was, you know, do you have children? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1061.6s)]
*  Well, you won't believe the dangers in your bathroom. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1068.6s)]
*  And you're like, well, I would I shit there like I would think it's probably not hygienic. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1071.6s)]
*  But it's always been about how do we keep the eyeballs right? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1076.6s)]
*  I'm going to use can may I use a not safe for work and somewhat a tawdry example here as for now, this has all been safe for work. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1081.6s)]
*  This has been your version of PG. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1089.6s)]
*  This is a classy program. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1091.6s)]
*  You do what you need to do. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1093.6s)]
*  As a good man. Thank you. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1095.6s)]
*  When I was a young man, 13, 14 years old, if I got a hold of a Sears catalog and there was a picture of a woman in a bra and I was like, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1097.6s)]
*  this is the most sexually exciting and arousing image. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1108.6s)]
*  And as you get older, you get to like that doesn't work on you anymore. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1112.6s)]
*  And you get to that point where you're like three people, a goat and and someone singing Pavarotti. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1117.6s)]
*  You're like, you know that that is you have to keep stimulating people further and further to different extremities to get that same hit of dopamine. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1125.6s)]
*  And those apps and that media, especially now, are scientifically designed purposefully. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1135.6s)]
*  Like the the woman who was blowing the whistle on Facebook, like our food is designed to escape that part of your brain that says I should stop eating right now. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1144.6s)]
*  Like this is purposeful. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1155.6s)]
*  The way that we are divided as people, some of it is political and weaponized by political actors. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1157.6s)]
*  But the majority of it is capitalism, capitalism with the idea of how do I generate the most income out of engagement? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1168.6s)]
*  And it turns out fear and anger and hate and outrage pay huge. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1179.6s)]
*  I'm not suggesting that a monkey washing a cat is in a tremendous video and that will also get clicks. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1187.6s)]
*  But that's not a business model. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1194.6s)]
*  The business model is creating an atmosphere of outrage and anger. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1196.6s)]
*  And so and so when you ask, does that have an effect? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1202.6s)]
*  It absolutely does. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1205.6s)]
*  And I think it does rewire the brains of the users. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1206.6s)]
*  When I was on your show, we were talking about a piece of this, actually, which is the way that you were saying, you know, there was a radio and then there was Fox News. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1210.6s)]
*  And one thing that has happened in I mean, in my lifetime, right, which is and I'm 40, is this tremendous segmentation. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1218.6s)]
*  The media broke into these like little competitive slices and you it's competitive. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1226.6s)]
*  Right. And competition can be great in the sense that it creates a lot of innovation. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1233.6s)]
*  And if the innovation is how to get your little slice away from everybody else, sometimes the competition can become warping. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1238.6s)]
*  And one of the things I always think people get really wrong about the media is they think that it is stronger and more self-directed than it is when particularly when it has gotten very, very competitive. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1246.6s)]
*  And it has when you say self-directed, what do you what do you mean by that? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1258.6s)]
*  I've been involved in lots of different media over the years. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1263.6s)]
*  And I think something that has surprised me from going from somebody who reads it to somebody who makes it is watching the way the media comes to reflect its audience unless a tremendous amount of editorial strength is applied in the opposite direction. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1266.6s)]
*  So the sense of the media is driving the audience. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1282.6s)]
*  Bar is not so right. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1286.6s)]
*  You just named you named the game. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1288.6s)]
*  You know, the lie travels eight times faster than the truth. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1291.6s)]
*  But that means that the truth has to work nine or ten times harder than a lie. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1295.6s)]
*  And lies are the thing that are most weaponized. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1300.6s)]
*  The truth is rarely weaponized, but the lies sure as shit are because that's what propaganda is. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1304.6s)]
*  And so the thing that you just said about the media not being self-directed, I think is probably putting your finger on in my mind exactly what is troubling that they themselves are victims of the incentivized algorithm that they're trying to compete with as opposed to viewing it as part of an ongoing battle. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1310.6s)]
*  To combat lies. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1337.6s)]
*  Your show has existed in two forms over time, right? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1342.6s)]
*  There's a form on Comedy Central and then the chopped up form that goes on YouTube. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1347.6s)]
*  Did does YouTube change it at all? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1352.6s)]
*  Do you understand the YouTube differences audience? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1354.6s)]
*  And do you think that the fact that it has this other life has shifted the way, you know, in its earlier incarnation or in its current one, the show gets made or what gets on it? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1357.6s)]
*  It hasn't changed the way we make it. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1367.6s)]
*  I don't know if chopping it up changes the way people experience it. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1369.6s)]
*  I would guess it does. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1373.6s)]
*  You mean in like because people get shorter and shorter like not only do they get shorter and shorter, but in a in an episode, I think about this all the time in my work. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1375.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1386.6s)]
*  When I was running Vox, when I was at the post, he's really got you bought the paper as a whole writer, the magazine, I was at the American Prospect. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1387.6s)]
*  He got the thing as a whole. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1394.6s)]
*  And so as an editor at one of those places, you would balance things out the stuff that was really appealing with the stuff that was maybe a bit more vegetables, the stuff that was a little bit more right and the stuff that was a little bit more left across the bundle that you are offering people. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1395.6s)]
*  But when the way things worked was he grabbed one article and shared it around. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1411.6s)]
*  And that article is then how people understood you, your ability to exercise editorial control over the whole of the thing went away. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1415.6s)]
*  And so, you know, maybe you do an episode that has different things in it for different people or as a whole, it exists in some way. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1423.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1431.6s)]
*  Then the fact that each segment has its own life. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1432.6s)]
*  What if I'm watching it on YouTube, which is often where I watch it, that that sort of control that ability to give you the balanced diet. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1435.6s)]
*  It's actually just not in your control any longer. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1443.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, boy, that's a good one, because it's you know, television is so different than, you know, I think your background is probably more in writing and and how people consume it. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1447.6s)]
*  But but reading is is such a more active process than viewership. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1460.6s)]
*  And and so I think because I have always been in. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1466.6s)]
*  Stand up or television, I assume a more passive audience. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1471.6s)]
*  And so I never think quite about did they get the whole thing? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1476.6s)]
*  Because I just always assume they're doing something else like especially, you know, it's 11 at night. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1481.6s)]
*  It's 1130 night. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1487.6s)]
*  I just always assume that I was a mild form of foreplay. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1488.6s)]
*  So I think the interesting thing about our process that's maybe different than what you're describing is how little we think about who might watch it and how they might watch it. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1493.6s)]
*  And someone asked me this once, you know, they said, you know, is the has the social media or any of those other things changed the way people consume your show? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1504.6s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1514.6s)]
*  I don't know them. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1516.6s)]
*  I know this. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1517.6s)]
*  It hasn't changed the way we make it, which is probably stupid. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1518.6s)]
*  It has changed the way we try to publicize it. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1522.6s)]
*  Like we will set out like if there's a good joke chunk, we'll send that out there and maybe people consume that as a way to maybe entice them. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1525.6s)]
*  But the other part of it is you're looking at the totality of analysis and news that makes up, you know, writing a considered article. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1533.6s)]
*  Form that you're really able to express a variety of different elements and you need the totality of that to, you know, actualize your readers. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1542.6s)]
*  The Daily Show really was like one op ed. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1554.6s)]
*  The evolution of the Daily Show was in. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1557.6s)]
*  We became, you know, a series of monologue jokes that became slightly more essayistic, but it was always just one essay. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1560.6s)]
*  So the burden of carrying that larger information world, I think we never felt if that makes sense. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1568.6s)]
*  And because we were steeped in television, you don't think of it in the same intellectual way that like you might as you're building Vox or as you're thinking about the New York Times. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1575.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1587.6s)]
*  The other thing that makes me think about, which is more private thought I've had over the years, is one of the things that I've noticed is that the way that people are thinking about the New York Times is that it's not just about the news. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1588.6s)]
*  Is one of the dangerous things as media went online. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1596.6s)]
*  You always want to be selling something that isn't the politics as your service to the audience, which is to say you were selling jokes as your first service to the audience. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1600.6s)]
*  And there was politics and analysis alongside that, but they could come for the jokes. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1609.6s)]
*  He didn't have to agree with the politics. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1614.6s)]
*  The New York Times, that's reporting, right? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1616.6s)]
*  You might hate what you understand to be the New York Times politics, but there's a ton of international reporting and we have people all over. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1619.6s)]
*  You know, the New Yorker, it's the narrative journalism, right? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1625.6s)]
*  There's a politics to the New Yorker, but you can come for the stories first. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1628.6s)]
*  And when you're just selling the politics, when you sort of distill it down to that, I mean, you were sort of making this about lies and truths. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1632.6s)]
*  But I think once it just becomes a politics, what you can really, like you have to be in agreement. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1641.6s)]
*  If you're a highly ideological organization and you have an audience, you have to be in agreement with the audience. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1647.6s)]
*  They have to be in agreement with you or you're going to die. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1654.6s)]
*  And the way that, you know, the Internet unbundled everything, you can just be coming for the sports. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1658.6s)]
*  It made that much more intense. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1663.6s)]
*  So it's chicken and the egg there, Ezra. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1665.6s)]
*  So again, that's when we talk about weaponization. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1667.6s)]
*  So it's this idea. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1669.6s)]
*  It depends on I would say rather than lies and truth, maybe the binary that I would talk about is good faith, bad faith. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1670.6s)]
*  Is the are you a purely political actor or do you believe there's utility in information or utility in good faith argumentation? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1676.6s)]
*  I would say that a lot of the media is not good faith argumentation. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1687.6s)]
*  It's political actors weaponizing forms of communication for the desired goal of shifting a political conversation towards one side, whether that means, you know, and there's different parameters to that. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1691.6s)]
*  You can do that by heightening your side's political thing. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1705.6s)]
*  You can do that by demonizing the other side's political thing. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1709.6s)]
*  You can do that by undercutting. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1712.6s)]
*  You can do that by warping. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1714.6s)]
*  But that that's the real difference. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1716.6s)]
*  I think there is there is a feeling there that they I think media doesn't know how to deal with bad actors and bad faith actors that have weaponized it. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1718.6s)]
*  And so they're forced to it reminds me of every Supreme Court confirmation hearing where the the person that has achieved this level of, you know, accolade as a lawyer or as a judge or whatever it is, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1730.6s)]
*  sits there and they say, What do you think about this? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1746.6s)]
*  And they go, I am an umpire and I would call balls and strikes and I would start a decisive the precedent. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1749.6s)]
*  It's what I and then they get on the court and they're like, I hate women and I'm going to do you know, it's all a bullshit show. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1757.6s)]
*  That's bad faith. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1766.6s)]
*  I so appreciate the segue that you've offered me. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1768.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1771.6s)]
*  You may remember or actually many people may not remember there was a show on CNN called Crossfire for a period of time that I'm not familiar with. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1772.6s)]
*  You know, it sounds fantastic. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1779.6s)]
*  I like any show that is named after what innocent bystanders get caught in in a let's say gang violence. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1781.6s)]
*  For somebody who's never seen Crossfire because something happened and ended up getting taken off of the air due to the actions of a rogue comedian. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1788.6s)]
*  What was it? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1804.6s)]
*  So what it started out as was this idea of good faith argumentation between people of differing political viewpoints. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1806.6s)]
*  I think the original premise of that is not by definition a bad thing. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1815.6s)]
*  I don't necessarily think that the binary of right and left or liberal and conservative is a particularly useful one. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1821.6s)]
*  But it was Michael Kinsley and Patrick Buchanan, the original sanity versus fear. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1828.6s)]
*  Yes, that but exactly right. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1833.6s)]
*  Slate versus Father Cocklin. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1836.6s)]
*  But what it turned into was and this is maybe the critique of Crossfire that I think everyone has misunderstood was this idea of it wasn't I wasn't calling for civility. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1838.6s)]
*  I was calling for a non Kabuki theater version. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1848.6s)]
*  That debate, of course, should be robust and at times angry. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1853.6s)]
*  And but it should be in a modicum of good faith. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1857.6s)]
*  And what it had become was sort of this very weaponized incentive ice theater. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1862.6s)]
*  So when you ask again back to the original question, what comes first, the chicken or the egg? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1868.6s)]
*  Well, what came first was an intention of having really interesting argumentation that could be illuminating and articulate differences. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1873.6s)]
*  And what the business model of 24 hour cable news turned it into was a perverse exercise in. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1885.6s)]
*  Cynical weaponized divisive conversation. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1897.6s)]
*  You're going to enjoy this. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1900.6s)]
*  So I'm going to play a clip. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1902.6s)]
*  This is not you've done a lot. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1904.6s)]
*  You've done a lot to deserve this. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1908.6s)]
*  There's karma. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1910.6s)]
*  You do this other people. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1911.6s)]
*  You have listeners. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1913.6s)]
*  Has this not happened to you? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1915.6s)]
*  No. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1917.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1918.6s)]
*  No. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1919.6s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1920.6s)]
*  I've not had a this is your life like this where you play things. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1921.6s)]
*  My wife after crossword my wife and this was before everything became viral and things like that. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1925.6s)]
*  Like that really hadn't happened at that point. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1930.6s)]
*  This was a long time ago. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1932.6s)]
*  My wife called me, called me, not texted me on my iPhone. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1933.6s)]
*  Like none of that shit existed. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1937.6s)]
*  She called me and said, don't you ever do something like that again. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1939.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1943.6s)]
*  And I'm going to play first what you did and then we can talk about it. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1944.6s)]
*  Sorry, you can cover your ears. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1948.6s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1951.6s)]
*  I'm here to confront you because we need help from the media and they're hurting us. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1952.6s)]
*  And it's the idea is. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1960.6s)]
*  The idea is. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1962.6s)]
*  If the indictment is and I have seen you say this that crossfire reduces everything as I said in the intro to left, right, black. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1963.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1972.6s)]
*  Well, it's because see we're a debate show. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1973.6s)]
*  It's like saying the one channel news is everything to a storm. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1975.6s)]
*  I would love to see a debate show. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1977.6s)]
*  In a 24 hour day where we have each side on as best we can get them. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1979.6s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1982.6s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1983.6s)]
*  And have them fight it out. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1984.6s)]
*  To do a debate would be great. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1985.6s)]
*  But that's like saying pro wrestling is a show about athletic competition. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1986.6s)]
*  I think you're a good comedian. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1991.6s)]
*  I think your lectures are boring. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1992.6s)]
*  Let me ask you. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1994.6s)]
*  Let me ask you a question on the news. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1995.6s)]
*  Now, this is theater. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1996.6s)]
*  I mean, it's obvious. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1997.6s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1998.6s)]
*  Thirty five. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=1999.6s)]
*  And you wear a bow tie. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2000.6s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2001.6s)]
*  So this is. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2002.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2003.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2004.6s)]
*  You're right. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2005.6s)]
*  Let me just go. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2006.6s)]
*  Now, come on. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2007.6s)]
*  And listen, I'm not. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2008.6s)]
*  I'm not suggesting that you're not. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2009.6s)]
*  You're not a smart guy because those are not easy to tie. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2010.6s)]
*  But the thing is that this you're doing theater when you should be doing debate, which would be great. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2012.6s)]
*  It's not honest. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2020.6s)]
*  What you do is not honest. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2021.6s)]
*  What you do is partisan hackery. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2023.6s)]
*  You can put them on now. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2026.6s)]
*  It's OK. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2027.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's safe now. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2028.6s)]
*  We're back in a safe space. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2029.6s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2030.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2031.6s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2032.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2033.6s)]
*  I knew Tucker Carlson in those days. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2034.6s)]
*  And his signal characteristic to me, the thing I think you were picking up on particularly [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2035.6s)]
*  about him is he treated it all as a joke. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2040.6s)]
*  You can go back and read Tucker Carlson's old magazine journalism. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2043.6s)]
*  And it's great, hilarious magazine journalism. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2047.6s)]
*  He's a very, very good magazine writer when he was young. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2050.6s)]
*  And he went through all these very quick transformations. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2052.6s)]
*  He was on MSNBC for a while. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2055.6s)]
*  People forget that. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2057.6s)]
*  Rachel Maddow's one of her early breaks was that she was a regular contributor to Tucker Carlson's show on MSNBC. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2058.6s)]
*  He was this kind of good times libertarian type. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2065.6s)]
*  And he was a guy who treated it all kind of as a game. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2068.6s)]
*  I guess what I will say for him now is I don't think it's a joke to him now. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2072.6s)]
*  Something happened there. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2076.6s)]
*  I think his politics are much more serious and much more real and obviously for that much more dangerous. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2078.6s)]
*  Humiliation happened. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2084.6s)]
*  Yeah, I'm curious how you understand his what happened to him psychologically. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2086.6s)]
*  Well, I think that and I hate to do this to you, Ezra. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2091.6s)]
*  I'm going to describe this to you in professional wrestling terms since that was one of the analogies that I used on there. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2097.6s)]
*  See, this is actually the sport I know. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2104.6s)]
*  OK, then Ezra, you and I are in good shape here. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2107.6s)]
*  K-Fabe, I got it. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2110.6s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2111.6s)]
*  So what I was complaining about on Crossfire was K-Fabe was this idea that this is just theater and everybody's playing a character and nobody's a ba-ba-ba. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2112.6s)]
*  But the other way to describe it for them is so there's an establishment and then there's the anti-establishment, right? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2121.6s)]
*  The disruptors and the rebels. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2129.6s)]
*  Tucker Carlson was establishment. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2132.6s)]
*  He was, you know, and he tried to be a face. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2134.6s)]
*  He was a heel like Fox News. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2138.6s)]
*  Megan Kelly, same thing. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2140.6s)]
*  Face being a good guy, heel being a bad guy. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2141.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2143.6s)]
*  So she was kind of a she's on the heel network, Fox, but she's kind of the face on Fox. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2144.6s)]
*  She's the one that like every now and again will say something and like the establishment or liberals will go like, wow, she actually that's empathy. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2149.6s)]
*  That's like that's interesting. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2156.6s)]
*  Oh, she's not toeing a dogmatic party line, right? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2157.6s)]
*  So they decide like, oh, I will live amongst the faces. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2161.6s)]
*  I will join them. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2165.6s)]
*  I will be a part of the establishment and the establishment and the faces reject them. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2166.6s)]
*  They feel wrongly and with a dogmatic litmus test and it's never good enough. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2171.6s)]
*  And it's their intolerance that put them in that position. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2176.6s)]
*  So they tried to live amongst the normies, right? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2180.6s)]
*  And when that blows up and creates humiliation, the anger and bitter and returns them to, I think. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2183.6s)]
*  They're truer selves. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2192.6s)]
*  I prefer them the way they are right now. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2194.6s)]
*  I kind of dig it. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2197.6s)]
*  It is like explain. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2198.6s)]
*  I'd rather someone not pretend to be Barbie and just be who she is, which is, I think, Ursula from The Little Mermaid. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2201.6s)]
*  See, I went from it really went from pro wrestling to The Little Mermaid. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2209.6s)]
*  You know, in many ways, Ezra, I am still stuck in the same entertainment options that I was using when my kids were little. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2213.6s)]
*  And that's that's why I'm frozen in that time. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2222.6s)]
*  But but do you get my point about like what happened is they view and Donald Trump in the same way. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2224.6s)]
*  He views that there's this world that is excluding them and they are excluding them purely for dogmatic. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2231.6s)]
*  And they think they're better than me. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2239.6s)]
*  And they hold these views that they think their shit doesn't stink. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2241.6s)]
*  And I stepped into that world and tried to, you know, be amongst them. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2245.6s)]
*  And they rejected that because they're assholes. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2250.6s)]
*  And now I can just be in my own world and be as angry and as vicious as I think I was treated. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2255.6s)]
*  I think that's kind of the way it goes. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2264.6s)]
*  I think it's so interesting. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2267.6s)]
*  I don't know Megyn Kelly's story as well as I know or watched Carlson and Trump. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2269.6s)]
*  I think it's a very I think it's very similar. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2274.6s)]
*  Yeah, I just her moment was the I joined NBC. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2276.6s)]
*  This morning is the launch of Megyn Kelly today just about six minutes from now. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2279.6s)]
*  Megan, good morning. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2283.6s)]
*  Show didn't go that well. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2286.6s)]
*  And by the way, in both instances, this is after being run out of Fox News, by the way, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2287.6s)]
*  because she asked hard questions of Donald Trump at the first debate. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2291.6s)]
*  Right. She was rejected by the right first because she was not sufficiently pro Trump. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2295.6s)]
*  And he came after her. And within a year she was out. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2301.6s)]
*  And that's why we're seeing that's what I meant by she was a face. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2303.6s)]
*  She became a face. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2305.6s)]
*  But so if you think about it, both Tucker Carlson and Megyn Kelly were rejected. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2307.6s)]
*  And the reasoning behind their rejection, I think, is still misunderstood. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2312.6s)]
*  I didn't get Crossfire canceled. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2317.6s)]
*  Crossfire's ratings sucked. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2319.6s)]
*  And CNN looked for a way out. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2321.6s)]
*  And that was a convenient flash point. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2325.6s)]
*  And by the way, none of that had much to do with Tucker Carlson. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2327.6s)]
*  Anyway, person I really didn't like there was Novak, but he just wasn't on the show that day. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2330.6s)]
*  And Megyn Kelly in the same thing. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2335.6s)]
*  Her show just wasn't connecting on NBC. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2337.6s)]
*  I'm Megyn Kelly. And I want to begin with two words. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2340.6s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2343.6s)]
*  You may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2345.6s)]
*  And then she had that moment of it was a blackface, I think, comment about the thing. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2350.6s)]
*  I defended the idea, saying as long as it was respectful and part of a Halloween costume, it seemed OK. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2355.6s)]
*  Well, I was wrong and I am sorry. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2362.6s)]
*  If her show was killing it, they'd have found a way to forgive it. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2365.6s)]
*  They'd have found a way to keep her on there. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2369.6s)]
*  But they used it as a convenient excuse. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2371.6s)]
*  Megyn Kelly looks to be parting ways with NBC. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2374.6s)]
*  Her show, Megyn Kelly Today, is now canceled. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2377.6s)]
*  The move comes four days after her blackface comments that provoked a firestorm, leading to a tearful apology. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2380.6s)]
*  The chairman of NBC News condemned Kelly's remarks during a staff town hall, according to Variety, saying there is no place on our air or in this workplace for them. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2388.6s)]
*  But I'm sure for her it was incredibly painful and felt like a canceled because of my viewpoints. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2397.6s)]
*  But the truth of the matter is, NBC executives and CNN executives, they aren't woke. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2406.6s)]
*  They aren't any of those things. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2412.6s)]
*  They're fucking desperately trying to hold on to their jobs by generating ad revenue by whatever means necessary. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2414.6s)]
*  And so that's what they got caught up on. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2421.6s)]
*  And by the way, though, the way that it happened attacked them at a core level. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2425.6s)]
*  And that's what's created it. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2431.6s)]
*  Like, I've been canceled a shit ton of times. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2433.6s)]
*  But the only reason I was canceled is like the network executives just were like, yeah, this show sucks. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2436.6s)]
*  Or you're not. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2442.6s)]
*  But they didn't say like, you're a bad person. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2443.6s)]
*  And that's why we're canceling the show. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2446.6s)]
*  And that's what they did to them. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2448.6s)]
*  The industry, rather than standing up for what was really going on there, which is you're not generating enough revenue and interest to justify your large contract or whatever it is. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2450.6s)]
*  They turned it into we're getting rid of you for a moral failing or lapse. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2464.6s)]
*  And that was wrong. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2472.6s)]
*  I really and that's not listen, I don't care for what they do. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2475.6s)]
*  I don't care for their opinions. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2480.6s)]
*  But what happened to them was wrong. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2482.6s)]
*  The executives are interesting here. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2486.6s)]
*  I was thinking about this when you were relaying that story about Roger Ailes. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2488.6s)]
*  Yes, because I there's a period of time in my life I did a lot of MSNBC and was a guest host on a lot of the primetime programs there. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2492.6s)]
*  And so I knew the people ran it pretty well. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2500.6s)]
*  And what I would say about the people who ran it was they were fundamentally not that ideological. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2502.6s)]
*  They were television executives, what they cared about. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2506.6s)]
*  And that's why Tucker Carlson had a show and why they were so excited about Joe Scarborough, you know, and still and still are why recently they tried to hire Ron McDaniel, the RNC chair, sort of disgraced RNC chair that did an end to end show. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2509.6s)]
*  And they ended up working out due to revolt by people at the network, morals. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2522.6s)]
*  Roger Ailes is honestly ideological, right? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2527.6s)]
*  He had, as he's put it, he had a vision, right? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2531.6s)]
*  He had a view about how things should be. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2533.6s)]
*  He wanted to be successful, but he also actually knew what he was trying to achieve in the world. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2535.6s)]
*  Those NBC executives who brought on Megyn Kelly, it was obvious to me that that show wasn't going to work. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2540.6s)]
*  But they they wanted the look of bringing on Megyn Kelly because they are not that ideological and particularly don't want to be seen as ideological. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2546.6s)]
*  But they're lying to themselves because they place things in a moral universe when they really are just crass executives who are trying to sell. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2553.6s)]
*  Like, that's the part where I think the critique, if there's one critique of the media from the right that I do agree with, is the moralizing nature. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2563.6s)]
*  You know, the idea that these media executives moralize their position, like there may be no greater disparity between reality and whatever idealized moral image you have of themselves than the Washington Post putting on their masthead. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2573.6s)]
*  Democracy dies in darkness. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2589.6s)]
*  Like, who the fuck do you think you are? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2592.6s)]
*  Like, what world? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2596.6s)]
*  You have a board up in your room that shows like who's getting what clicks where. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2597.6s)]
*  Like, that's just nonsense. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2602.6s)]
*  And this idea that, I mean, I would almost welcome, maybe not necessarily a more moral component, but a component of the news media that is more forceful editorially. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2603.6s)]
*  Like, Ailes' greatest trick was delegitimizing the idea of editorial authority while exercising almost complete editorial authority, but doing it a way that was really smart. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2616.6s)]
*  Like, there is no condescension and moralizing on Fox. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2632.6s)]
*  It's people on a couch asking questions. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2637.6s)]
*  Are you worried about how many terrorists are coming in on the border? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2639.6s)]
*  Do you ever worry about that? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2643.6s)]
*  Whereas if you turn on MSC sometimes you're like, it's like birds descending, you know, at sea on a tuna boat going, that's factually incorrect. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2645.6s)]
*  Incorrect. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2656.6s)]
*  Not correct. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2658.6s)]
*  Incorrect. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2659.6s)]
*  And you're just like, I can't listen to this. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2661.6s)]
*  But that's the brilliance of it. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2664.6s)]
*  But, you know, so when I say like, Megyn Kelly's right, like, I do believe she's right. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2665.6s)]
*  They pretended that they had to get rid of her out of some moral obligation to enlightened racism, you know, racism sensibility. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2671.6s)]
*  Like, fuck you. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2681.6s)]
*  That is so not what you did. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2683.6s)]
*  If they're making money, they're making money and they'll let you get away with anything, anything as we see. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2685.6s)]
*  But when you ain't making money anymore and they don't for some reason have the temerity to just go, yeah, you're not making us any money. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2691.6s)]
*  They find some pretense of your moral failing and yank you. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2697.6s)]
*  And so I get where the where some of that anger comes from, from those folks don't have a ton of sympathy because I've been fired a bunch of times too. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2703.6s)]
*  But for the the old fashioned reasons of sucking. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2716.6s)]
*  When I think of Tucker Carlson now, I miss the triviality. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2719.6s)]
*  I miss the that there was enough agreed upon that you could have the theater, the Kabuki. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2722.6s)]
*  And now it feels like we've slipped down in this place where it's like, will we be a white ethno-nationalist state? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2728.6s)]
*  That's harder to have like a funny debate over. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2734.6s)]
*  But you always have to caution yourself against a nostalgia about this other time that existed because, you know, William Hurst and yellow journalism and, you know, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2737.6s)]
*  remember, the main can be just as damaging even though it's newspaper or think about, you know, radio in Rwanda or think about, you know, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2749.6s)]
*  propaganda that was piped into soldiers ears during, you know, different times on the radio. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2760.6s)]
*  But again, media has to continue to raise the bar in terms of the circadian rhythm of it, the cadence of it. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2766.6s)]
*  It has to happen faster now. It happens more. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2775.6s)]
*  And the difficulty is for the parts of media that we look at as utility. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2778.6s)]
*  Right. Think about the checks and balances of the government. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2783.6s)]
*  This is going to be a segue that doesn't make any sense. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2786.6s)]
*  But think about in the way that they describe the House of Representatives in the Senate. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2788.6s)]
*  Somebody's got to be the Senate, not the Senate as it's presently constituted, but the normal Senate before it was an assisted living facility. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2791.6s)]
*  So, you know, it has to be the the saucer that cools the milk or whatever the fuck they want to describe it as. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2798.6s)]
*  And that's what we're missing, because what's happening is everybody's chasing that most dopamine addled, you know, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2805.6s)]
*  cocaine hamster sitting in a cage tap in the bar like whatever makes content. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2815.6s)]
*  Right. Becomes kind of fodder for all the other outlets that make their bones on content. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2821.6s)]
*  So like whatever you put out, like we're going to talk about this, right. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2832.6s)]
*  I don't know what will be clipped from this. Generally, something will be clipped. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2835.6s)]
*  Generally, it's something that will reflect very little context about what we're talking about, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2841.6s)]
*  but could be considered the most divisive or confrontational or provocative or partisan moment. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2846.6s)]
*  Right. I did an interview with Tim Walz. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2854.6s)]
*  What will get clipped out of that is I had a moment where I was like, do we need the Cheney's? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2857.6s)]
*  The Cheney thing. Do we really have to do that? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2862.6s)]
*  Look, it goes broader than that. Look, Bernie Sanders, Dick Cheney, Taylor Swift. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2868.6s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2873.6s)]
*  Oh, are they shooting? Having the Cheney's on board? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2875.6s)]
*  No, you can't. Dick Cheney or Taylor Swift. No. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2877.6s)]
*  And that's the moment that will be grabbed because how do those other outlets make their money? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2882.6s)]
*  They don't make their money by going, oh, I saw this interview and it had ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2888.6s)]
*  They make their money by getting people to click. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2893.6s)]
*  So rather than cooling it or debating it in good faith or looking at the issues, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2895.6s)]
*  they look for a moment that they can exploit. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2901.6s)]
*  And I don't look back with fond nostalgia over the early 2000s. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2903.6s)]
*  Even the New York Times credulously published something. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2910.6s)]
*  And Dick Cheney and his friends got to go on all the Sunday shows the next day and go, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2914.6s)]
*  even the New York Times says Saddam Hussein is trying to make a nuclear weapon with these tubes [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2918.6s)]
*  that can only enrich uranium. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2923.6s)]
*  Like I have no nostalgia that somehow this form of media can be more dangerous or like it can all be very dangerous. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2925.6s)]
*  And that's why we have to in whatever moment we're living in, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2936.6s)]
*  fight like fucking hell to take the danger out of it and to get better understanding into it. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2940.6s)]
*  And we have the mechanisms and we have the talent and we have the people. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2948.6s)]
*  We just need the will. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2953.6s)]
*  Roger Ailes built Fox News Media out of tenacity and will and skill as a producer. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2955.6s)]
*  We have to match that with the same intentionality that he brought to it. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2961.6s)]
*  I sat in his office one day and we yelled at each other for an hour. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2967.6s)]
*  But my takeaway from it was that empire was built out of the back of his head purposefully [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2972.6s)]
*  with an idea to delegitimize any media that may take away from his vision of what the world should be. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2979.6s)]
*  God, there's so much there. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2989.6s)]
*  When you were talking about nostalgia and I am I keep saying this like on every seventh show, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2991.6s)]
*  I will die on the hill of fighting the George W. Bush revisionist nostalgia. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=2997.6s)]
*  Donald Trump is the fault of Dick Cheney. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3007.6s)]
*  I believe this to my core. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3011.6s)]
*  We would not have Donald Trump if we had not had Dick Cheney and the Iraq War [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3013.6s)]
*  and the delegitimization of the entire upper echelons of the Republican Party that came out of that much failure. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3018.6s)]
*  And so something about seeing Dick Cheney who now endorsing Harris and Liz Cheney, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3025.6s)]
*  who to be fair, I do admire that Liz Cheney was willing to lose her seat to oppose Donald Trump's anti-democratic movements. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3032.6s)]
*  But there is something about the bar that think about the bar that sets though as I applaud the courage of someone [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3042.6s)]
*  who recognizes a coup and decides to say something about it. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3051.6s)]
*  But how many of the others didn't? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3055.6s)]
*  No, that's what I'm saying. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3056.6s)]
*  That's like that is the lowest bar. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3058.6s)]
*  But there is this way it's like between recognizing there's something important there and the genuine absence of accountability. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3061.6s)]
*  I mean, there is something. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3069.6s)]
*  Oh, I think other people recognize there's something important. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3070.6s)]
*  I just think they put the project over the principle. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3073.6s)]
*  The overall project is the look, we're in a different world now, man, like the old world communism versus capitalism moment is over. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3078.6s)]
*  And by the way, it was a fight that, you know, had more death and destruction in it than I think was probably ever necessary. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3091.6s)]
*  All that really I think this country needed to fend off communism and socialism is a decent social safety net, which I think was was demonstrated. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3101.6s)]
*  But now we're in a different world where the alignment is, I think, woke versus un-woke. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3110.6s)]
*  And the interesting thing is the un-woke people think they're the defenders of classic liberalism when all of their allies in it like Orban and Putin and that. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3116.6s)]
*  That's the new alignment of the world woke versus un-woke. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3126.6s)]
*  And the classic defenders, the people in the media and in government who say I'm the defenders of the Constitution and free speech and would like to align myself with Orban and Putin like the cognitive dissonance that occurs there is mind blowing. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3130.6s)]
*  I remember when Elon Musk took over Twitter to protect free speech and make sure Twitter was politically neutral. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3147.6s)]
*  And now here we are. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3155.6s)]
*  But no, it's and but but it's in many ways a cynical exercise. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3156.6s)]
*  And you can say to them, Donald Trump is threatening broadcast license because he doesn't like that they're critical of him or Donald Trump is calling people the enemy within and not migrant gangs. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3160.6s)]
*  He's talking about Nancy Pelosi. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3174.6s)]
*  And you say, so how are you the defender of the First Amendment? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3176.6s)]
*  And that's the guy you're throwing. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3182.6s)]
*  Well, that's just bluster. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3184.6s)]
*  Oh, he doesn't mean that. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3185.6s)]
*  He does a thing. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3186.6s)]
*  You know, none of this particularly makes any sense. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3187.6s)]
*  And if you want to talk about cancel culture, there is no greater cancel culture than being a Republican and speaking out even in the mildest forms against Donald Trump. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3190.6s)]
*  So where's where's the where's the free speech in any of this? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3200.6s)]
*  It does. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3204.6s)]
*  None of this makes any fucking sense. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3205.6s)]
*  Ezra makes sense of it. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3208.6s)]
*  Ezra, you're very smart. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3209.6s)]
*  Please help me. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3211.6s)]
*  I like the cut you're making. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3212.6s)]
*  Like, I do think there's something to the woke, not woke. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3215.6s)]
*  I think that people I mean, we were talking about this when I was on your show. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3218.6s)]
*  It's funny because we're circling some of the same topics here. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3221.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3224.6s)]
*  It is one of the oldest findings of political science that people are not that ideological, that the people have definitely agree with that have this like who experience politics as this well connected sense of this web of policies that all go together. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3225.6s)]
*  And if you know, you pick the liberal web or the conservative web, that's like 10 percent of the population. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3241.6s)]
*  Like most people, there's not other experience politics or the world. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3248.6s)]
*  And one of the things that bugs me is the endless at this point, I don't think people should still be saying should still be surprised that Donald Trump has appeal. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3251.6s)]
*  We've seen Donald Trump like your figures in too many other countries. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3260.6s)]
*  The fact that he doesn't appeal to you. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3263.6s)]
*  But if you believe Donald Trump should be losing this election by 60, you know, 65, 35, and it's just like a failure of political strategy on Kamala Harris's part. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3266.6s)]
*  Like, I think you've missed the boat. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3274.6s)]
*  You miss the actual appeal of strongman politics, which have been there forever. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3276.6s)]
*  You've missed the appeal of people who say, I don't like how all this is changing. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3282.6s)]
*  And I wanted to stop. There are people I love who support Donald Trump. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3286.6s)]
*  And it's one of the best things in my politics that I have them in my life, because you can, you know, one, it keeps my sense of people's complexity alive. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3289.6s)]
*  But but to one thing you hear is just people saying, I don't know, everything's different now. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3298.6s)]
*  And I don't like I don't feel like I have a place in it. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3304.6s)]
*  And some level Donald Trump agrees with them. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3306.6s)]
*  It was better before. Make America great again. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3309.6s)]
*  And that's a politics that sometimes gets policies attached to it. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3311.6s)]
*  But it's not really a politics that is about policies or even about any one thing. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3315.6s)]
*  I mean, vibes, a sense of do you fit in the world and where it's going? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3320.6s)]
*  Do you have status in the world and where it's going? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3325.6s)]
*  I think we try to find a strong man as long as it's my strongman, as long as it's following along to that point as I mean, you know, look, I'm not in a swing state. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3328.6s)]
*  So I don't know exactly. But we still have down ballot races that are being communicated all the time. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3337.6s)]
*  The big clamoring about Kamala Harris was she has to define who she is through a series of policy things that appeal to the American people. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3343.6s)]
*  And that will help them get comfortable with her as a leader and. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3350.6s)]
*  Every commercial that I see on my television, there's only two arguments the Republicans are making. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3354.6s)]
*  Republican candidates are making two arguments. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3359.6s)]
*  We're all going to die because of people coming over from the border. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3361.6s)]
*  And Kamala Harris is for they, them. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3366.6s)]
*  Donald Trump is for you. Those are the only two commercials, trans people and migration. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3369.6s)]
*  That's it. And that's, you know, listen. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3376.6s)]
*  And that's, you know, listen, and they all talk about [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3378.6s)]
*  trans people shouldn't be in sports, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3380.8399999999997s)]
*  as though like that is the dominant theme [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3382.96s)]
*  of like high school athletics now is like, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3386.24s)]
*  my kids were high school age a couple of years ago. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3389.48s)]
*  I don't recall there ever being a trans person [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3391.68s)]
*  playing the sport or dominating or having [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3396.56s)]
*  any consequential action on that. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3399.3199999999997s)]
*  But I will tell you this, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3401.9s)]
*  if you're concerned about competition and fairness, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3402.7599999999998s)]
*  I've seen a lot of parents who reclass their kids [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3407.02s)]
*  to drop them down a grade, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3410.14s)]
*  not because they can't handle the social aspect of it, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3411.82s)]
*  not because they can't handle the academics, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3414.2599999999998s)]
*  but because it will make them a more appealing [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3416.1s)]
*  athletic prospect. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3418.58s)]
*  So 19 year olds are beating the shit out of 14 year olds [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3420.32s)]
*  in high school sports. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3424.88s)]
*  You wanna do something about competition, do that. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3425.98s)]
*  But what they've done is they've taken a kind of non problem [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3428.74s)]
*  and blown it into a catastrophic emblem [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3433.02s)]
*  of a society in decline. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3438.02s)]
*  But emblem is such an important, I think, word there. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3440.06s)]
*  Because the reason there is strength to what they're doing [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3443.38s)]
*  is yeah, it's not, look, I am fully happy to say [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3446.54s)]
*  if we could agree on giving people rights [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3449.98s)]
*  and protection from discrimination, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3455.06s)]
*  we can then have some conversations about the right way [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3456.78s)]
*  to manage swimming at the NCAA level. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3458.82s)]
*  I think a society could say sports are arbitrary, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3461.2599999999998s)]
*  we're gonna figure something out. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3465.1s)]
*  But it's all a signal of they are turning society [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3466.58s)]
*  into something you don't understand anymore. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3471.22s)]
*  It's not a policy. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3475.22s)]
*  And what they do though is, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3476.62s)]
*  and they blow it out anecdotally through, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3479.54s)]
*  these social media apps with their algorithms [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3482.94s)]
*  and incentives, that is the whole point [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3485.88s)]
*  as we circle back to the thing, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3487.34s)]
*  is they are able to take those uncomfortable feelings [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3489.02s)]
*  of change and create an urgency. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3493.66s)]
*  There's something very, like I have anxiety and insomnia, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3498.42s)]
*  had it my whole life. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3501.78s)]
*  What it does is actually physical. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3503.9s)]
*  Like your mind will take you to places [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3509.02s)]
*  that you believe in your body are now happening. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3511.9s)]
*  Cortisol is flowing and you feel an urgency [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3515.34s)]
*  and an almost a fear and a panic, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3518.9s)]
*  whether or not what you're experiencing is real, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3522.1800000000003s)]
*  imminent, impossible, it doesn't matter. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3526.02s)]
*  And what the algorithms do that is so destructive [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3530.62s)]
*  and brilliant is what people in white lab coats do [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3535.1s)]
*  to lays potato chips. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3539.2200000000003s)]
*  They design it in a way, the algorithm finds a way [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3541.7400000000002s)]
*  to take a piece of information [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3546.0s)]
*  and put it into your body in a way [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3548.06s)]
*  that drags you into a rabbit hole [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3550.06s)]
*  and creates in your body that sense of panic and fear. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3551.82s)]
*  They physicalize it in a way that a newspaper never could. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3556.62s)]
*  And that's the danger here. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3561.9s)]
*  And always, by the way, the most vulnerable populations. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3564.46s)]
*  You notice that it's not anybody [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3567.54s)]
*  but like the people with the fewest defenders, always. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3569.86s)]
*  Always. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3574.4s)]
*  I wanna end on not how everybody else changed, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3575.58s)]
*  but how you did. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3578.2599999999998s)]
*  And when I go back to old Jon Stewart, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3579.1s)]
*  I'm not gonna play anything at you, you're safe now. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3581.7s)]
*  Please. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3583.5s)]
*  There was a sort of sanity, we can all be, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3585.2599999999998s)]
*  let's have some common sense here, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3588.2999999999997s)]
*  like let's not be idiots. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3589.46s)]
*  You have this great long traffic analogy [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3590.2999999999997s)]
*  in your sanity speech about us all on the road together. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3592.2599999999998s)]
*  And I listen to you now, listen to the podcast, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3595.2599999999998s)]
*  got to appear on it, which was a thrill. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3596.98s)]
*  And there's a, you're more of a populist now, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3599.3799999999997s)]
*  like left populist, but it feels to me like the sense that- [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3602.24s)]
*  Politically, I think I've always been. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3606.7799999999997s)]
*  I think politically, but there's a, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3608.46s)]
*  I think there is a sense that I did not used to get from you. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3611.2599999999998s)]
*  That I would describe your politics much more now, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3615.7s)]
*  not as technocratic, but as power conceives nothing [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3617.74s)]
*  without a fight. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3620.5s)]
*  And that you can't pull the value off. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3622.2999999999997s)]
*  That I completely agree with. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3623.7s)]
*  I think the difference is in the populations [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3625.06s)]
*  that I'm talking about. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3629.2999999999997s)]
*  I think I've always separated, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3630.7799999999997s)]
*  the idea has always been 80 to 90% of the people [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3633.02s)]
*  can find some ability to work together in common ground [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3636.86s)]
*  and move forward in a productive fashion. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3640.66s)]
*  And the other 10 to 15% of those people run the place. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3643.46s)]
*  And that has always been my position. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3648.14s)]
*  And I think some of it has been informed by some of the, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3650.26s)]
*  having to go down to Washington to try [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3655.7400000000002s)]
*  and accomplish something, not in the media world, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3659.34s)]
*  but in the real world. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3661.92s)]
*  And the realities of what it takes to move a machine [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3664.56s)]
*  that is built for the status quo [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3670.92s)]
*  and built for the disconnect between their power structure [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3673.4s)]
*  and the needs of the people that they purport to represent. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3677.64s)]
*  So there is certainly a more sober view [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3682.08s)]
*  of what it takes to move that machine, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3686.56s)]
*  but I have never thought there was anything other [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3689.52s)]
*  than the people and the machine. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3692.08s)]
*  And what's so frustrating about that is we the people, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3694.84s)]
*  by the people, for the people, of the people. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3699.08s)]
*  And what is it about that process that removes us from them? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3701.6s)]
*  That's the part that I think is so difficult. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3709.2s)]
*  So now when I think of solutions, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3713.2s)]
*  I think less of those processes [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3714.6s)]
*  and changing it in more fundamental ways. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3716.52s)]
*  I think less of we gotta get more unionizing, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3720.2s)]
*  gotta get more people and think like, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3721.7599999999998s)]
*  no, the whole structure has to change. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3723.04s)]
*  They need to be able to participate in the investment [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3725.72s)]
*  and shareholder economy at that table. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3728.68s)]
*  Whatever feast is being had there must be had here. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3732.08s)]
*  And they shouldn't have to get better, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3736.64s)]
*  poor people shouldn't have to get better lobbyists. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3738.7599999999998s)]
*  Veterans who are struggling with toxic exposure [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3741.8799999999997s)]
*  shouldn't have to find public figures. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3744.24s)]
*  None of this shit should be the way [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3747.32s)]
*  that you permeate that bubble. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3748.7200000000003s)]
*  But I don't think the fundamental truth [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3751.44s)]
*  that people inherently in day-to-day lives [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3756.44s)]
*  have an ability to be with each other healthily, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3760.1600000000003s)]
*  that hasn't changed for me, I don't think. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3764.48s)]
*  That's a great place to end. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3767.2400000000002s)]
*  Always our final question. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3768.28s)]
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3769.48s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3772.92s)]
*  I Shouldn't Be Telling You This by Chelsea Devantes. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3776.44s)]
*  That's what I have there. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3780.36s)]
*  Well, that sounded like you were telling me a secret. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3782.04s)]
*  No, the book is called I Shouldn't Be Telling You This. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3783.96s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3786.16s)]
*  She's a friend of mine who is a wonderful comedian [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3788.12s)]
*  and a writer and her memoir. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3791.16s)]
*  She just written, I think, a few months ago [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3793.52s)]
*  and it's absolutely wonderful. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3795.68s)]
*  Chelsea Devantes was her name? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3798.44s)]
*  Chelsea Devantes, yeah, fabulous comedian. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3799.96s)]
*  Whenever I recommend books, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3804.52s)]
*  I always go back to the books of my youth. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3805.96s)]
*  That's great. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3808.8s)]
*  And so it's always Vonnegut. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3809.64s)]
*  Get your hands on Vonnegut [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3811.92s)]
*  because if there was anyone that I think [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3813.7200000000003s)]
*  more impressed my worldview, it was Vonnegut. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3817.68s)]
*  This idea of a guy who had been through World War II [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3820.68s)]
*  in Dresden and yet still maintained [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3822.8s)]
*  a hopeful humanistic approach, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3826.0s)]
*  even tinged with the cynicism [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3830.8s)]
*  that obviously comes through people like Carlin [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3833.32s)]
*  and anything, any book by Carlin or Vonnegut. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3836.1600000000003s)]
*  And I know those sound disparate. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3839.4s)]
*  Where do you start? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3840.7200000000003s)]
*  Give me a Vonnegut for... [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3841.56s)]
*  I would start Breakfast of Champions with Vonnegut [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3843.8s)]
*  or maybe play a piano. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3847.76s)]
*  You can't, boy, you just can't go wrong. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3850.6s)]
*  Cat's Cradle, you can't go wrong. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3852.6800000000003s)]
*  Slaughterhouse Five, whatever you wanna do. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3854.76s)]
*  God bless you, Mr. Rosewell. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3857.84s)]
*  Whatever you want. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3860.4s)]
*  It just doesn't matter. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3861.6s)]
*  Because you'll dive in and you'll be transported [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3862.92s)]
*  to that world of a hopeful, heartbroken man [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3866.0s)]
*  writing about what he thinks people could be. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3871.4s)]
*  It's that, you know, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3874.2000000000003s)]
*  it's the William Shatner Blue Origin moment [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3876.44s)]
*  where he goes up in space and he looks down on the earth [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3879.12s)]
*  and goes, how are we blowing this? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3881.28s)]
*  How the fuck in this dark expanse of nothingness, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3884.08s)]
*  we have the one... [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3888.08s)]
*  It's like the same thing I think when they always say like, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3889.12s)]
*  we're going to Mars and you're like, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3891.7599999999998s)]
*  but the water and the food is here. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3893.0s)]
*  Why? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3895.8s)]
*  Why don't we just stay here and make this work? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3896.64s)]
*  What's wrong with that? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3900.7599999999998s)]
*  Anyway, Vonnegut. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3904.12s)]
*  A hopeful, heartbroken man. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3905.8s)]
*  Jon Stewart, thank you very much. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3907.16s)]
*  All right. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3909.36s)]
*  Pull yourself together [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3910.2799999999997s)]
*  to create something that they think is nothing [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3911.52s)]
*  and it has to be something safe and swirling. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3919.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3924.3599999999997s)]
*  It really is. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3925.0s)]

*  Thank you? [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3927.16s)]
*  That was just the thought that was cooked up in me [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3928.6s)]
*  as a bigod England puppet [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3932.12s)]
*  and a little bit of reality as well. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3933.3199999999997s)]
*  Congratulations. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3935.72s)]
*  Another 그리 Quality Emp incense. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryjv4xUHZGM&t=3936.7599999999998s)]
