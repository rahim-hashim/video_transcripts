# What We Learned Reading Ron DeSantis's Books
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [June 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59e_6r8L0Oo)
*  So the Republican 2024 race is off in earnest.
*  As of this week, there are now 12 candidates declared.
*  It's become in a big field, but only two of those candidates are polling above
*  single digits.
*  Donald Trump, who you may remember from such presidencies as the one right
*  before this one, he's polling in the mid fifties and Ron DeSantis, the governor
*  of Florida, who is polling in the twenties.
*  Now I've not always been on the DeSantis bus in the way some others are.
*  You may remember that my post-midterm podcast was titled, I Don't Quite
*  Buy the DeSantis Narrative.
*  I didn't think his win in Florida was more impressive than Mike DeWine's
*  win in Ohio, say DeWine won by more or Jared Polis's win in Colorado.
*  The idea that out of 2022 DeSantis was some unstoppable juggernaut.
*  I didn't see the evidence for it, but I now think the situation is flipped.
*  And if anything, he's being underrated.
*  I've been listening to DeSantis give speeches and listening to him give
*  interviews, and I don't think he's as unlikeable or robotic on the stump as
*  liberals have kind of been telling themselves he is.
*  There was a lot of anti-DeSantis glee in his glitchy Twitter spaces rollout,
*  but that doesn't really mean anything for his candidacy.
*  And this is a guy who has won tough races before.
*  He's a guy who knows the story he is telling and he's pretty good
*  and precise at telling it.
*  It's a story, I think, if you listen to it closely, that is going to scare liberals.
*  And the question is whether it's going to actually thrill conservatives.
*  So what is that story and how does he tell it?
*  I seem to be a bit weird about this, but I'm a believer that you can learn a lot
*  by reading the books politicians released during presidential campaigns.
*  A lot of people dismiss these as poll tested committee written fluff,
*  which is fine.
*  They often are, but these are books where the politician gets to craft and
*  shape their own story at length and how somebody wants you to see them.
*  That tells you a lot about how they see themselves.
*  It tells you a lot about how they see you.
*  And so I've been reading Rhonda Santus's book, The Courage to Be Free,
*  Florida's blueprint for America's revival.
*  And I wouldn't call it a good book exactly, even by the standards of this
*  genre, but it is a very revealing one.
*  And so I wanted to talk about it with someone who is expert at
*  reading these kinds of books.
*  My colleague Carlos Lozada was a longtime Pulitzer Prize winning nonfiction
*  book critic at the Washington Post.
*  He even wrote a book about other political books.
*  It's called What Were We Thinking?
*  In which he read the torrent of Trump era political books and tried to understand
*  the meta narrative that emerged out of them.
*  And he's not only read to Santas's most recent book, but he won up me by reading
*  his little known 2011 book, Dreams from Our Founding Father.
*  So he's a sense of the way that the Santas story has changed over
*  the course of his career.
*  I should note too, Carlos is one of the co-hosts of the Great New Matter of
*  Opinion podcast, also produced by New York Times Opinion Audio, which you
*  should check out if you haven't.
*  But he joins me for a deep dive into the Ron DeSantis texts.
*  Now, as always, my email, Ezra Klein show at nytimes.com.
*  Carlos Lozada, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks for having me, Ezra.
*  So Ron DeSantis' book is called The Courage to Be Free.
*  It opens with a quote by Winston Churchill.
*  Courage is rightly considered the foremost of virtues for
*  upon it all others depend.
*  So what is the kind of courage DeSantis is describing or more to the point,
*  what is the kind of courage he's claiming to have shown?
*  It's the courage to go after his enemies.
*  This book is by and large an enemies list.
*  And for DeSantis, that's the news media, which he always prefaces with like,
*  you know, the corporate media or the legacy media.
*  It's big tech, which he calls the censorship arm of the left, the
*  administrative state or it's sort of COVID era spin-off, which is the
*  biomedical security state led by Anthony Fauci and the elite universities
*  that he attended, such as Harvard and Yale.
*  There are a lot of kind of convenient bogeymen in this book.
*  And the biggest one, of course, is wokeness.
*  Florida is where woke goes to die has become his go-to line.
*  And I count every five or six pages, there's a reliable assault
*  on the woke or on wokeness.
*  And so in terms of courage, that's his courage.
*  The courage that he's beating his chest about is the courage
*  to assault these various enemies.
*  I'm always interested in these books as the politician in question begins to try
*  to build their worldview for you, where they go off the beaten path.
*  And I think your description of the book as an enemies list is deeply true.
*  And one thing that he does, which caught my eye very early on is try to cohere
*  those enemies into something more united and something that makes him look like
*  the underdog standing against unbelievable forces right against him.
*  And he does it by referencing this sort of weird essay written by Angelo Codavilla
*  in the American spectator, long time ago, 2010 now, where Codavilla tries to describe
*  this idea of a ruling class.
*  Were you familiar with that description of it and what did you make of that?
*  Well, I mean, I wasn't until I read the book, but that argument about the ruling
*  class, about the elite recurs throughout DeSantis's book, but it's basically
*  a standard populist playbook.
*  What is the definition of populism?
*  Right?
*  The first thing about it is that it's anti-elitist.
*  There are these forces at the top who are running the commanding heights of everything.
*  And I stand here against them.
*  And that runs through all of what DeSantis is talking about in this book.
*  You know, the other aspects of populism is that it's anti-pluralist, right?
*  Is that, you know, I represent the people and that it's exclusionary, that only some
*  of the people are counted as the people.
*  And so really the anti-woke-ism of DeSantis, that's sort of the badge of honor for him.
*  That's just another way for a different audience of talking about this anti-elitism.
*  So I went back to read that essay and I was fascinated by it because it of course has
*  the problem this kind of politics always has and this kind of essay always has, which
*  is how do you describe a ruling class that doesn't include all the people who agree
*  with you, but literally rule, or they have huge amounts of political power or economic
*  power or media power.
*  And in that essay, Codavilla's solution, I think it's a one DeSantis adopts throughout
*  his book, is to say the ruling class is defined, quote, above all by a certain attitude.
*  And so, and now I'm not quoting him.
*  And so if you share that attitude, you're part of it.
*  And if you don't, no matter how rich you are or how powerful you are, you aren't.
*  So then you can be President Donald Trump or Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas or
*  the highest rated anchor on Fox News or the governor of Florida and not be part of the
*  ruling class because culturally you don't share their attitude or their alliances.
*  And this feels to me like an important thing DeSantis is doing repeatedly because
*  otherwise he actually looks like the bully using the entire power of the government of
*  Florida to crush his enemies.
*  But he's up against this weird ruling class.
*  He doesn't. How do you think about that move he's making?
*  I mean, I think that there absolutely is a sense in which cultural elites and political
*  elites talk down to the masses of American society.
*  And I think that's a nonpartisan hazard of inhabiting that elite.
*  DeSantis makes his entire platform, however, all about fighting that.
*  When he looks at what he accomplished in Florida, it's entirely that battle, right?
*  It's about Florida schools, about, you know, fighting against the teaching of systemic
*  racism. It's about gender identity, transgender athletics in women's sports.
*  Woke capital. Why should Disney get to speak up against what, you know, I'm doing here to
*  defend you, the people?
*  So I think it's it can be both true.
*  It can be both real, a thing that happens, and it can be taken to an extreme such as
*  DeSantis is doing where it's not just true.
*  It's the only thing.
*  And I think that's probably where he crosses a line of even how most people live their
*  lives, right? People who would find reasons to be resentful of the ruling elite.
*  That's not like all they eat and drink and sleep every day.
*  But that's the only message DeSantis has.
*  So I want to keep this framework in our mind.
*  And I want to jump forward in the book to as DeSantis begins his real political journey,
*  particularly to Washington and the way he describes that story is playing out.
*  He writes this book about how Barack Obama was betraying the vision of the founding
*  fathers. And it kind of comes out of nowhere in his description.
*  He's deployed for a bit.
*  He's gone to law school.
*  He's not really described himself as political.
*  And then all of a sudden he's hanging out and he decides to write a book about Barack
*  Obama's constitutional betrayals.
*  I think you've taken a look at that book and I haven't.
*  So I wanted to see what you took from it, how you would describe it.
*  I read it. It's actually much better than the courage to be free.
*  It's called Dreams from My Founding Fathers.
*  Get it?
*  Yes, it is a pretty overt and unsubtle dig
*  at Obama's Dreams from My Father, the memoir he wrote in the 90s that then
*  later when Obama became a big deal, the memoir really took off and became kind of
*  a signature part of his story.
*  So it's an attack on Obama.
*  This was as the country was gearing up for the 2012, you know, reelection campaign,
*  the Obama-Romney battle.
*  It's both an attack on Obama and at the same time, a sort of love letter to the
*  founders, in particular, Madison and Hamilton.
*  And essentially, he argues that the Obama agenda of transformation and
*  redistribution is irreconcilable with the principles of the founders and that
*  Obama is driven by, you know, his father's anti-colonialism, by Jeremiah
*  Wright, by Saul Alinsky, and not really by the vision of the founders.
*  He says, James Madison was a freedom man.
*  Obama is a government man.
*  That's basically the message.
*  Now, it shows a fairly deep reading of the Federalist Papers, of the debates
*  around ratification of the Constitution.
*  It's something that if it's a made up contrived interest, it was very well done.
*  It probably is something that matters to him.
*  But what's interesting to me is that in some sense, the Ron DeSantis of circa
*  2010 and the Ron DeSantis of 2023 don't really get along.
*  These books feel to me like they're in somewhat of opposition to each other.
*  In The Courage to Be Free, DeSantis is far less driven by any kind of
*  constitutional ethic, as he would call it in the earlier book, and more by
*  fighting people whose agendas are different from his own.
*  There's a thread.
*  There's a kind of an intellectual coherence to the first book, whether
*  you agree with it or not, that is missing in the second.
*  It also struck me just when I was looking at the coverage around the first book and
*  looking at its framing, that there's a, for lack of a better term, a conservative
*  trendiness to DeSantis, and he's not alone in this.
*  I mean, it's a normal politician thing to tack with the center or the
*  energies of your party.
*  Joe Biden does it.
*  But DeSantis likes to talk about himself as completely un-poll tested, you know,
*  just a leader from his own gut.
*  But that book is framed exactly around the aesthetics of the 2010 Tea Party moment.
*  And then DeSantis makes this big turn towards MAGA and Trumpism famously has
*  this ad when he's running for governor in Florida, where he's reading his, you
*  know, children Donald Trump books to go to sleep and, you know, building a wall
*  with them out of blocks.
*  And there's just a funny way in which for somebody who, so much of his political
*  aesthetic is his bullheaded independence, for him to shift from the sort of Tea
*  Party constitutionalists, revering the founding fathers thing in 2010 to the
*  aggressive populist hates the ruling class, you know, will stop at nothing to
*  destroy his enemies version that he's presenting in 2023.
*  It makes him look very sensitive actually to the winds of his party.
*  You're right.
*  This book is full MAGA.
*  I hadn't thought about that transition the way you described it, but what's
*  interesting to me is that he doesn't quite capture each one.
*  He's very earnestly trying to be Mr.
*  Tea Party in the first book.
*  And he's trying to ride the MAGA wave in the second, but he just seems slightly
*  off in both cases by focusing so zealously on the constitutional basis for the Tea
*  Party and the return to first principles.
*  He missed a lot of what was going on.
*  A lot of the energy that was surrounding the Tea Party.
*  And here, even when he tries to be MAGA in the second book, he's got the
*  talking points down, right?
*  He's a culture warrior, but he kind of wants to be a competent culture warrior.
*  It reminds me of when Hillary Clinton was asked in 2016, so are you a moderate
*  or progressive?
*  And she's like, I'm a progressive, but I'm progressive who likes to get things done.
*  And here, Ron DeSantis is kind of like the culture warrior who wants to get things
*  done.
*  And he says in the epilogue to the courage to be free, he says, you know,
*  clearly our administration was substantively consequential, you know, and I
*  don't know that make America substantively consequential has the same kind of ring to it.
*  It's what Trump senses as a weakness in DeSantis, rightly or wrongly, in his, I
*  think both revealing and slightly doesn't roll out the tongue nickname DeSanctimonious,
*  which is that both then and now DeSantis is the grind.
*  He's never in on the joke that something about Trump and DeSantis likes to sort of
*  contrast like the entertainer versus the people get things done, but something Trump
*  understands about MAGA is it is a show, is that there is a kind of joke you are
*  supposed to wink a bit, not because you don't believe it, but because the energy,
*  the vibe of it is this riotous, anarchic, angry, free thing.
*  It is supposed to be fun to be part of Donald Trump's movement.
*  And the Tea Party had a bit of that energy in its own ways too.
*  You know, the people with their tricorner hats and, you know, if you went to any Tea
*  Party rallies at that time, they were these high energy things.
*  I mean, they were apocalyptic also, but they were a festival.
*  DeSantis was not a major Tea Party figure then.
*  I mean, we'll talk about his time in Washington in a second, but I think something
*  he has struggled with and he seems to be struggling with a bit now and struggled
*  with then is that he takes himself and these movements much more seriously in a
*  way than the people in them do.
*  He takes him extremely literally.
*  What I've always thought about the Trumpist energy, as you describe it, is that,
*  you know, it's not about necessarily believing the things he says.
*  It's not about belief.
*  It's about allegiance.
*  Even believing or claiming to accept a proven lie or something on which Trump
*  might change his mind and so you change along with him shows that it's not really
*  about holding on to a true core conviction.
*  It's about showing what team you're on and about sticking it to the other side.
*  I think you're right that that kind of energy, which I suppose can be fun in the
*  right hands, is missing from DeSantis' writing for sure.
*  His case against Trump, you know, you brought up the entertainment aspect of it.
*  He says that a lot.
*  Politics isn't about entertaining, about brand building and, you know,
*  and being great on social media.
*  But in some ways it is.
*  And in some, you know, he showed his failure on social media when he announced
*  on Twitter with Elon Musk.
*  But I think throughout the Courage to Be Free, there is a case against Trump.
*  It's a subtle one.
*  It's not very in your face.
*  But he tries to say, for instance, you know, we have to expand the base.
*  We can't just rely on those who got us here.
*  He doesn't mention January 6th, but he says, you know, the executive must govern
*  within the confines of the constitutional system, right?
*  He criticizes officials who want to, quote, perpetuate themselves in office.
*  He says, I don't place loyalty to me as my overriding concern and place loyalty
*  to the cause.
*  These are all little ways where he tries to draw distinctions between himself
*  and Trump without being very overt.
*  It's almost like he's waging this like proxy battle.
*  So I want to come back to Trump in a couple of minutes, because I want to go
*  here to when he gets to Washington.
*  He writes this book, he runs in a Republican primary, he wins the Republican
*  primary, he wins the general election.
*  And now he's coming to Washington.
*  He's a congressman, you know, coming to the swamp, although it didn't get called
*  that in the same way back then.
*  How do you describe the way DeSantis presents or narrativeizes his time as a
*  member of Congress?
*  He does a couple of things when he highlights his positions during that time.
*  It's all Trumpy or proto Trumpy in a sense.
*  He says that, you know, that he argued for a border wall, that he highlighted the
*  threat of radical Islam, even that he was calling for the relocation of the
*  American embassy to Jerusalem.
*  And one thing he tries to do, and again, not to bring it all back to Trump, but
*  he brought up how DeSantis had that ad about his support for Donald Trump, where
*  like his baby's in a MAGA onesie and they're building a wall with blocks.
*  When he looks back on his time in Congress, he's basically saying that he
*  and other freedom caucus members paved the way for someone like Trump to emerge.
*  You know, we identified the shortcomings of the modern GOP establishment and, you
*  know, paved the way for an outsider to come to power.
*  So he's basically saying, yeah, Trump says that he made me, well, I kind of made
*  him as well.
*  And that's how he kind of looks back and interprets or redefines part of what was
*  going on during his years in Congress.
*  So one thing I found valuable about a section on DC is that it lays out a lot of
*  his national political structural thinking.
*  And I want to read a couple of pieces because one thing I kept noticing was
*  what I would call projection.
*  DeSantis keeps describing dynamics that I would say describe him, but the way he
*  understands it is they describe the ruling class or everybody else.
*  He writes, quote, the media also serves as de facto enforce of party discipline for
*  Democrats and as an instigator of party dissension among Republicans.
*  A Democrat has no incentive to buck the party to work with Republicans.
*  All the organs of the progressive left will go on the attack and the media will
*  channel those attacks against any Democrat.
*  Then he goes on to say, a Republican who joins with the left against the party
*  will be the subject of glowing profiles and legacy newspapers and magazines and
*  seemingly endless TV bookings on CNN.
*  One piece of this is it's weird.
*  I'm part of the media.
*  I know exactly the dynamic he's talking about, but it is a very bipartisan dynamic.
*  It's true that John McCain was beloved on the Sunday shows.
*  So is Joe Manchin.
*  So was Joe Lieberman.
*  The media has always loved these crossover figures.
*  But something that it triggered for me in thinking about DeSantis book is I've read
*  a lot of campaign books.
*  I think they're actually pretty revealing, but almost every one that I've read when I
*  think about Joe Biden's book, Hillary Clinton's book, Barack Obama's book, Bill
*  Clinton's book, and a lot of others, they're really focused on showing their
*  bipartisan credentials.
*  That's what all those books on some level are actually about.
*  And DeSantis book is one of the first of these that I've read that I can remember.
*  That really doesn't try to do this.
*  Right.
*  The thing about that, that is at the very least, I think a gamble is when you go back
*  in recent American political history and you think of politicians who ran for
*  president, won the nomination, and let's call it won the popular vote at least
*  once in general, they try to take that mantle of the center.
*  They try to take the mantle of bipartisanship and they do it in different ways,
*  but he never tries to say, and here's a place where I cross the aisle or here's a
*  place where I understand what the other side is thinking.
*  And I'm kind of sympathetic to it.
*  I mean, it is just, I will crush them and I will hear the lamentations
*  of their families.
*  Like that's it.
*  Yeah.
*  I sense the Conan the Barbarian moment there, Ezra.
*  The pivot they would always make and that they don't make anymore is, you know,
*  you run for the primary for the nomination in that way, and then you
*  pivot, right?
*  You move to the center to try to capture a bigger slice of the electorate.
*  And that's the part that I think Trump killed off.
*  And I can't imagine Ron DeSantis running a red meat primary and then a soup and
*  salad kind of general election.
*  I think if he were to win the nomination, he would probably go even deeper.
*  The strategy was essentially to run counter to what the Republican autopsy
*  said, that you have to expand the base, you know, go up to different kinds of
*  voters, you know, for Trump is about turning out more of the base of people who
*  were probably too disaffected to vote before.
*  So I think DeSantis is following the Trump playbook in that sense.
*  I don't know if that's enough to say that the old playbook is over.
*  The last thing that struck me as interesting about the section is that a fair
*  amount of it is devoted to explaining why Ron DeSantis has no record of
*  legislative success whatsoever from his time in Congress, right?
*  Part of it is him saying, you know, he was a reformer and they were never going
*  to put him on the good committees and never going to fast track his bills.
*  I mean, he was on the judiciary committee.
*  It's not a terrible committee assignment among others to be fair.
*  And the only bill he really mentions authoring and passing is called the
*  puppies assisting wounded service members for veterans therapy act.
*  Pause.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Which nothing against dogs for wounded service members.
*  I think that's a great cause.
*  But if that's the mark you made on Washington, if you're having a brag in
*  your campaign book and luckily he's governor next and we'll talk about that.
*  It does have a record to run on there, but it is relevant that he actually was
*  pretty bad at working with Congress federally when that was his job.
*  I mean, if you're in your campaign book, bragging about how you put the dogs for
*  wounded service members issue on the map, what you're really saying in a way.
*  Is it, you didn't put any issues on the map.
*  I mean, he tries to frame himself as involved in the immigration
*  debates and the, and a bunch of others, but he wasn't, I mean, I was covering
*  Washington then he wasn't really known as a major figure on, on any of those.
*  No, he wasn't a player.
*  I mean, the question though is to what extent is legislative achievement?
*  A banner on which you run for even higher office anymore.
*  The notion of people coming to serve in the house because they want to get X,
*  Y, or Z particular things done versus I'm coming to Washington and I'm
*  going to have a comms strategy.
*  I'm going to be on Fox.
*  I'm going to rile the base.
*  I'm going to get on TV.
*  I'm going to be active on social media.
*  There's a different ethic of service in Congress, especially I think on the
*  right, but not solely on the right.
*  That makes that gap that you've highlighted from his record and from
*  this book, I think less important than it might've been before.
*  Also, I wouldn't, this is a small point, but I wouldn't, you know, minimize the.
*  I don't mean that particular piece of legislation, but just anything that can
*  get you on the side of veterans.
*  He talks a lot about his service in Iraq and in the Navy.
*  He puts that all together as part of that story, but bottom line, I think
*  legislative achievement is not all that anymore when it comes to your, your time
*  in Congress.
*  And look, if all he had was his time in Congress, we wouldn't be having this
*  conversation, but he then runs for governor.
*  And I would say the structure of the book takes this huge change right here,
*  because I would describe the way he explains his time in Washington as he
*  hates the place.
*  He doesn't like the people he's frustrated.
*  And if you read between the lines at all, he's not getting much done.
*  But then when you move to his time as governor chapter seven, which really
*  opens that has a title taken from one of the federalist papers written by
*  Hamilton and it's called energy in the executive.
*  Yes.
*  And I think if I were going to title his book, try to give it an apt title, that
*  is what he's really saying he is.
*  I think energy in the executive is like the right title for this book.
*  So tell me a bit about the case he's making there.
*  It's the most kind of conventional political story, I think, that he tells
*  about himself.
*  You know, he has his blueprint for a bold agenda that he outlines, right.
*  And that's fiscal responsibility, education policy, you know, for school
*  choice, accountability in government, you know, combating illegal immigration.
*  It's the litany of policy choices that would not be out of bounds in a far more
*  conventional sort of non-Trump era Republican governorship.
*  That to me was part of watching him explain that record as governor.
*  He retroactively transforms it into much more of a culture war interpretation for
*  everything.
*  But if you look at the array of issues that he was engaged in, it didn't seem to
*  me to be that unusual for his party.
*  I took some of what he's doing in these chapters as a way of both explicitly, but
*  also implicitly making a critique of Joe Biden, but also Donald Trump.
*  DeSantis is running in the primary and in the general, if he makes it to the
*  general, against two much older men.
*  Who a knock on both of them, fairly or unfairly is that they've lost a step.
*  I mean, Trump famously really wouldn't come over from the residence over to the
*  Oval Office before about 11 in the morning.
*  He's distractible.
*  He likes watching a lot of cable news on his own time and around that.
*  And this seems to be something DeSantis is folding into the idea of energy.
*  He's undisciplined.
*  He doesn't read the briefing books.
*  He doesn't do the work.
*  He doesn't know how to work the levers of government.
*  Then of course, the broad view of Biden on the right, but someone on the left too,
*  if you look at polling, is that he's getting too old for the job.
*  There's worries, you know, he's misspeaking, maybe he's lost a step.
*  And so I took a lot of the energy in the executive framing as being a way of
*  trying to make the age critique, but make it by saying, you know, I have this
*  more intangible, but also necessary asset these other guys lack, which is energy,
*  vigor, attention, discipline.
*  I think that is part of the implicit case he's making, certainly about Trump, but
*  you're right, likely about Biden as well.
*  He doesn't really have to say it very much.
*  Seems a lot older to me.
*  We're the same generation.
*  There you go.
*  There you go.
*  By the way, he mentions you twice in the first book.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yes, he does.
*  Positively, I'm sure.
*  He's, no, he's very upset with you because you don't sufficiently
*  respect the founders or the constitution.
*  We'll see.
*  Just FYI.
*  I've not had any confusion as to whether or not I was going to be on
*  Ron DeSantis' enemies list.
*  I mean, it's, it's a case that he doesn't have to make.
*  He's younger.
*  His wife is younger.
*  You know, they go out there together.
*  They look like a young couple.
*  And I think that the less overt he is with it, the more he lets other
*  people make that case for him.
*  The better off he is.
*  There's something very unsubtle about energy in the executive, right?
*  As a title, as opposed to whom, right?
*  Obviously as opposed to Trump, as opposed to Biden.
*  He's not making that case on the stump when it comes to Trump.
*  He's making it about Joe Biden.
*  I was listening to one of his early speeches post official
*  announcement in New Hampshire, and he does open it.
*  So Joe Biden recently tripped over a sandbag.
*  He did see, I think a lot of people saw he had a fall at this Air Force event.
*  And, you know, I don't know if he sustained injuries, but I just want to say that we
*  hope and wish Joe Biden a swift recovery from any injuries he may have sustained.
*  But we also wish the United States of America a swift recovery from the injuries
*  it has sustained because of Joe Biden and his policies.
*  And it's such a mean spirited little riff.
*  It's such an overplaying of the hand.
*  In some ways, I thought Ron DeSantis is overvalued as a political
*  prospect right after the midterm.
*  My post midterm podcast was about this.
*  Right now, I think he's undervalued as a political prospect.
*  I think he's better on the stump and in interviews than a lot of liberals have
*  convinced themselves he is, and he does have a story to tell, but there is something
*  about him where he can't resist throwing the full punch.
*  He can't just seem like a decent guy when he's talking about people he doesn't like.
*  And that's a tricky thing, right?
*  You got to be careful with these age arguments.
*  You got to be careful with these things about taking advantage of
*  somebody else getting hurt.
*  And he's not careful.
*  He's very careless.
*  And I mean, you know, no one should take political advice from me.
*  That's not the line of work I'm in, but it seems utterly unnecessary.
*  Everyone else is having that conversation.
*  The front page of the New York Times is having that conversation.
*  You don't need to come off in that sort of gratuitous, kind of mean spirited
*  way where you're, you know, literally it's like a 40 something guy beating up on an
*  80 year old guy and it's not particularly classy.
*  So it seems unnecessary as part of the story, even with that really kind of ham
*  fisted pivot, you know, from like, well, maybe he's uninjured, but the country's injured.
*  I mean, it's just unnecessary.
*  He's obviously far younger than Trump and Biden.
*  And it just seems entirely unnecessary for him to do that.
*  So the place where I think DeSantis makes a case around energy that is more substantive,
*  less of a kind of nudge nudge.
*  These guys are old.
*  And I think this case is by the way, substantiate.
*  I think it is real.
*  I think it is a genuine case for his candidacy.
*  If you believe in what he believes in is that he has had the energy and the
*  discipline and the rigor to pay attention to what he can do and do it to the utmost of his
*  abilities.
*  He writes, one of my first orders of business after getting elected was to have my
*  transition team amass an exhaustive list of all the constitutional, statutory and
*  customary powers of the governor.
*  I wanted to be sure that I was using every lever available to advance our priorities.
*  We talked to political experts in Florida about DeSantis, you know, so we weren't just
*  existing within his own rhetorical universe in the book.
*  And they said every one of them that he has really controlled the legislature, that he
*  has really very effectively wielded the powers of the governor, the powers of the
*  agencies to his benefit.
*  And again and again, I think he really makes his case.
*  And I do think this ends up being a critique, sub rosa or not of Trump, who is
*  terrible at this kind of thing, of he figured out how to dominate the structure of the
*  government he was in control of in order to pass his agenda and to punish his enemies.
*  And that that's part of the energy of the executive.
*  Like the energy of the executive is in part to master the government.
*  And he's got both the energy and the discipline to do that.
*  I'm glad you raised that because that's one of the places where his critique of Trump, I
*  feel, is pretty overt.
*  He describes a moment after Hurricane Michael hit Florida in late 2018, where he is
*  asking for increased federal aid, especially for the northwest of the state.
*  And he meets with Trump and he tells him, look, you know, this is Trump country.
*  We really need some help.
*  And Trump responds with sort of Pavlovian enthusiasm when he's told that these are
*  his voters.
*  He's like, oh yeah, I won 90% of the votes out there.
*  You know, what do they need?
*  So Trump ostensibly promises to boost federal aid.
*  But then DeSantis writes about how Mick Mulvaney, who was the acting chief of staff,
*  pulls him aside after the meeting and says, look, don't announce that yet because he has
*  no idea what he agreed to.
*  You know, he doesn't understand the price tag.
*  You know, he just, he was just having a conversation with you.
*  And so then he had to negotiate with Mulvaney about like when he would be able to kind of
*  announce that he was getting more federal aid.
*  And what he's doing there, you know, in the book, you could say he's thanking Trump for
*  increased federal assistance, but he's really showcasing how Trump had no idea about even
*  the basics of governing.
*  And that anecdote struck me as a pretty kind of obvious contrast that he's drawing between
*  what you describe, you know, his mastery of the possibilities of government and the way
*  Trump ran his White House.
*  I thought the stories about Trump, there's another one where he is asking Trump for some
*  normal picky thing.
*  And as he's leaving the room, Trump says, Ron, you better make sure I win Florida.
*  I would say the only place in the book where DeSantis is even mildly funny.
*  I mean, it is a book just unbelievably without a sense of humor.
*  But the stories of Trump are quite funny.
*  I mean, they're very normal.
*  They're kind of the stories everybody tells about Trump.
*  But the thing they are repeatedly showing is that Trump was disengaged, as you're saying,
*  and not just disengaged, right, not just not paying attention, but almost congenitally
*  unable to pay attention.
*  I would say what they're really showing is Trump is a narcissist in a way that DeSantis
*  frames himself as not being.
*  This is something you pointed out in your column, but DeSantis talks about hiring people
*  who are loyal to the cause, not to him.
*  Hiring people who are not just going to tell him what he wants to hear, but who are at
*  least as long as they're coming from a philosophically conservative place he approves of,
*  you know, actually be there in conversation, in agreement, in disagreement with him.
*  And he frames Trump as unable to get out of his own story about himself, whereas he
*  frames himself as in the way he runs government, in the way he staffs government, as not
*  interested in bootlickers.
*  I mean, whether it's true or not, I don't really know, but interested in people who
*  are going to get the job he wants them to get done, done.
*  Yes, he's the culture warrior who likes to get things done.
*  The other thing about how DeSantis describes himself, though, that I found interesting
*  in this book is that unlike, say, the constitutional semi-T Party conservative of the
*  first book, here he has very generic explanations for what his kind of underlying beliefs
*  might be. Right.
*  He says a governor has to have a sense of a true north to guide him, willingness to
*  lead with conviction.
*  These are meaningless terms.
*  Right.
*  These are words that have no depth to them.
*  You know, he says he's God fearing, hardworking, America loving.
*  Reminds me of this cartoon book that my kids have where there's a politician saying, I
*  am for things that are good and I am against things that are bad.
*  You know, and someone in the crowd saying, God, finally someone who gets it.
*  And that's kind of the way DeSantis talks about himself.
*  You know, the path forward is not difficult to identify, just requires using basic common
*  sense and applying core American values to the problems of the day.
*  There's no there there to what's actually animating him.
*  So here's the final line in his book.
*  The Florida blueprint is a simple formula.
*  Be willing to lead, have the courage of your convictions, deliver for your constituents
*  and reap the political rewards.
*  This is a blueprint for America's revival.
*  It's a blueprint for nothing.
*  Right.
*  Like those are terms that don't mean anything.
*  And that's kind of where he ends up.
*  I found this entire book disappointing in the sense that you don't get at the core
*  convictions of a candidate for president.
*  You do get a sense of how he, as you said, he's getting better at seeing which way the
*  winds of the party are blowing, but he's not driven by anything in particular beyond
*  perhaps ambition and beyond the desire to harness the feelings of his party in his
*  effort to win.
*  I'm going to be more on the DeSantis side here.
*  I thought there was more thickness in his description of himself as governor.
*  And I thought that I'd say two things about it.
*  One is that the way I read a number of the stories is really interesting.
*  And this, I think also has to do with what the political structure of Florida was in
*  this time, but a little bit like Trump too.
*  DeSantis is not in a fight with the Democratic Party.
*  His opponent is not the Democratic Party.
*  It's the media.
*  And I think this is clearest and his description of the way he understood an issue and
*  the way he tried to navigate it is thickest when he talks about COVID and the way in
*  which, at least the way he saw it, he was standing up on behalf of Floridians to an
*  almost overwhelming backlash driven by the media, the public health establishment, the
*  whole ruling class, so to speak.
*  And in a lot of ways, both here and in speeches I've heard him give, you would think that
*  he's running against Anthony Fauci, right?
*  Not Donald Trump, not even Joe Biden, Fauci, right?
*  That he's running against Fauci.
*  But similarly, you know, he talks about with his own head advisor on this saying, look,
*  I don't even know what you're doing lately, but I see you're getting a lot of crap from
*  the mainstream media, so I know you're doing something good.
*  And he describes with Fauci this sort of ruling class, this, you know, he's a very
*  public health regime, overwhelming even President Trump, right?
*  Trump is the one who has Fauci in that position during this time.
*  And so this is, in a way, a funny part of DeSantis' campaign.
*  On the one hand, I don't really think you can run in 2024 on your COVID policies from
*  2021, but on the other hand, it is a place where to give him something like credit, he
*  really did stand in the way he says he will against criticism, against what a lot of
*  people were telling him to do.
*  And, you know, Florida's COVID outcomes, if you adjust for age and comorbidities, they're
*  middling and it doesn't look that different when you adjust for what we know how to adjust
*  for to see what the death rates are.
*  So his case on that is not that bad.
*  I saw the attacks on Fauci and the, you know, his recap of his COVID record a little more
*  broadly, like, yes, I think he has a record to run on.
*  I think the further away we get from the pandemic, the less Anthony Fauci as a sort of
*  supervillain will be useful as a campaign talking point.
*  I thought that he was essentially waging a proxy battle against Trump, but he didn't
*  want to bring up Trump, so he was using Fauci as kind of a stand-in because a lot of the
*  contrast that he's drawing is from that first year of the pandemic, which was under Donald
*  Trump. So he says that it's Anthony Fauci.
*  He was one of the most destructive bureaucrats in American history.
*  You know, our cities became Faucivilles, right, like Hoovervilles.
*  Fauci is this destroyer of jobs and freedom, you know, the architect of a Faucian dystopia.
*  It was Fauci, not Trump, in this telling who was at fault here.
*  And Florida stands in the way of that, right?
*  He says, you know, as the Iron Curtain of Fauciism descended upon America, you know,
*  Florida stood in the way.
*  It was the West Berlin.
*  So I took it as sort of a it's the courage to be free, but he really had the courage to
*  attack Trump only through the proxy of Anthony Fauci.
*  That's how I saw that moment.
*  To go back to the conversation we were having about energy, the critique DeSantis is making
*  of Trump here. One thing DeSantis says, and again, the reason this part of the book read
*  differently than others is that, look, he didn't buy the mainstream take, including
*  the mainstream epidemiological takes on Covid.
*  He went out and found his own experts from Stanford and other places that were analyzing
*  this. And he came himself to different conclusions and he describes different reasons he
*  did and different studies he was relying on.
*  You know, there's a thing about the decay rate of Covid waves.
*  And there's another thing, you know, about how they were targeting into senior citizen
*  homes, because if you really looked at who was dying, just the comorbidity of being
*  elderly was huge. And so you could have a much more targeted approach.
*  And I see that as making sort of two critiques of Trump.
*  One is the one I think you're getting at, which is Trump is overmatched by his own
*  government. If you want to take the more blameless version for Trump, as opposed to
*  Trump actually agreed with Anthony Fauci, you could just say that on this, as in many
*  other places, Trump was not in the details enough and did not have the mastery of his
*  own bureaucracy to put his sort of person in charge and to be able to assess what was
*  being told to him and be able to assemble the staff who would tell him what he needed
*  to hear. But he, Ronda Santis, did.
*  And then similarly, you know, I think his other major argument, and this is, I think,
*  where the courage to lead becomes his theme.
*  Nothing else he does, I think, really takes any courage in the book, at least as a public
*  official going to Iraq, certainly takes courage.
*  As a public official, he's beaten up on the LGBTQ community.
*  But on COVID, there really was a lot of pressure to do mask mandates, to close schools.
*  But where he's saying that, listen, when I think this whole establishment milieu is wrong
*  and is cramming their big government and their biomedical security state down your
*  throats, I will stand in their way and I will not agree and I will find my own sources of
*  information and I will keep my own head.
*  I think it's kind of his best case.
*  In a way, I think it's a problem for him because his best case is over.
*  But I do think that his critique of Trump and his argument for himself in this way,
*  that the reason COVID, I think, is so important to him is that it's where they unite.
*  I think it's kind of the crucible for him of his governance, where his self-conception
*  clicks into place and where his critique of Trump clicks into place, because it's the
*  place for him where Trump basically betrays his own ideas and maybe even what Ron
*  DeSantis thought Donald Trump was.
*  And Trump bows to the ruling class and basically runs the government the way he
*  thinks a liberal would have run it.
*  I think that last point that you made about the critique that Trump was bowing to the
*  ruling class is what puts DeSantis' COVID record at the center of his argument.
*  It's completely in keeping with the anti-elitism that undergirds the whole book.
*  Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health, the biomedical security state, the
*  we know better nanny state, that is what Ron DeSantis is fighting.
*  And unlike his record in Congress that we talked about, this is something real that
*  he can show.
*  You know, like I stood up to the elites who were telling me there was only one way to
*  do things.
*  So I think that's it's powerful.
*  Yes, it recedes with time because COVID recedes with time, but it's powerful in the
*  sense of like, here is how I manage a crisis.
*  That's what the presidency is about.
*  It's about the unexpected thing that hits you in, you know, January of 2020.
*  And you have to decide who you're going to be, how you're going to govern.
*  And so I think that's a powerful message and it fits perfectly into the populist
*  anti-elite argument that DeSantis is making throughout his book and in his early
*  campaign.
*  The flip of that, the place where I think a real weakness opens up for DeSantis in
*  the book as I read it, and it's particularly actually a weakness against Donald Trump.
*  One of Trump's advantages right now is that people trust him on the economy.
*  He's much more trusted than Joe Biden on the economy.
*  People remember the, particularly the end of the Trump economy is pretty good.
*  He did preside over a fairly large boom.
*  There is almost nothing about economics in this entire book.
*  I mean, I don't know what he thinks about wages and wage growth.
*  I don't know what he thinks about inflation and how to tame it.
*  I don't know what he thinks about health care.
*  I mean, I know some of his record from Congress, but he's really got no record on
*  that in any big ways, but he's running for president now at a time of high
*  inflation where Trump's biggest advantage is, you know, former businessman who ran
*  a strong economy, whatever you think of them and nothing like that.
*  That almost felt like malpractice.
*  Well, I mean, you, you go to war with the army you have, right?
*  I mean, it's not an area where his record has been distinguished or active.
*  You know, I mean, there's very little about foreign policy and international
*  affairs in this book either.
*  And he talks about Taiwan and it's almost, I mean, it's pathetic.
*  He knew some Taiwanese kids when he played in the little league world series.
*  Right.
*  And that's what he draws upon in the book.
*  It would have been better if he'd said nothing at all.
*  Trump has the benefit and the drawback of having been president.
*  Right.
*  And so he can say that he had a powerful economy in the first three years, and then
*  he can claim no blame for how it went down the tubes during COVID.
*  He has a record managing an economy for better or for worse.
*  All that DeSantis can really point to is that a lot of people move to Florida.
*  You know, he brings up those indicators a lot throughout this book.
*  People want to be here.
*  We must be doing something right.
*  He talks about taxes and the lack of an income tax as if that had been something
*  that, that he had accomplished on the stump.
*  That's a standard line.
*  He's kind of grasping for what he can in those cases, but you're right.
*  That is a void and I don't know how he can get around it.
*  I mean, it's not the only void in this book.
*  So the other major theme then for him of his own governorship is his fight against
*  what we'll call wokeness here, what he calls wokeness actually more to the point
*  and what he never defines.
*  How do you understand what he thinks wokeness is?
*  Yeah, it's usually pretty generic.
*  I counted how many times the term comes up in the book.
*  It's 46 times either woke or wokeness.
*  And the context is usually, it's like an insult.
*  It's an add-on.
*  You know, the democratic party is a woke dumpster fire.
*  The corporate media lives in a woke bubble, right?
*  The woke mob is trying to impose its will on us.
*  Even he says the meaning of the term is not entirely clear.
*  He writes that what constitutes woke is open to debate, but for the left, a
*  fundamental attribute of wokeness is the subordination of the word wokeness.
*  For the left, a fundamental attribute of wokeness is the subordination of facts
*  and evidence to anecdote and ideology.
*  Now, maybe so that's also the description of any political or cultural movement or
*  tactic where you try to shape some kind of political narrative to suit your ends.
*  Right?
*  The subordination of facts and evidence to narrative is not the sole province
*  of the so-called woke left.
*  The only places where I think he does try to get more specific is, for instance,
*  education, the teaching of systemic racism and systemic forces like racism.
*  You know, that's something he refers to overtly as wokeness.
*  Wokeness in terms of the gender identity debates.
*  He really focuses on woke capital, right?
*  On the ability of corporations to not just impose, you know, environmental and
*  social and governance standards, but also of CEOs to get on the woke bandwagon, so
*  to speak, and spread those values across the world.
*  So those are the few cases where he tries to put some meat on it.
*  And of course, exhibit A in the woke capital thing is his battle with Disney.
*  So I'm glad you brought up education there.
*  My big takeaway from the book, my prediction, is that Ron DeSantis'
*  campaign is going to be about education.
*  And the reason is that unlike COVID, which has declined dramatically as a major
*  political issue, what education does for DeSantis is it unites his three areas of
*  either accomplishment or focus.
*  So one, it is, I think his strongest ground on COVID, which is it he kept his
*  schools open or at least reopen them very quickly.
*  And so when California was still substantially closed, when New York was,
*  everybody was guaranteed a full school week back in Florida.
*  And I think that decision looks pretty good now.
*  Many people thought it was a good decision at the time.
*  It looks better now.
*  So that gives him a way of talking about what he did right in COVID that I think
*  is pretty strong political ground.
*  Then he also expanded school choice in Florida quite a bit and school choice.
*  We can argue about it, but it's a much more traditional conservative policy.
*  That's a place where he has a conservative policy accomplishment that is significant.
*  It is real.
*  It is his.
*  It is very appealing to the religious right and he can run on it in a normal way.
*  And then it's where he has chosen to fight a lot of his battles over what he calls
*  wokeness, a lot of what he is fighting about is over what you can teach children
*  in schools.
*  He calls discussing gender identity, sexualizing children, or he has fought
*  against versions of the AP African-American studies course and has bills on what you
*  can and can't teach around systemic racism.
*  You know, and he's really framing that as standing up for parental rights that you as
*  a parent should have control and input and visibility into what your children and he
*  frames it usually as young children, although his bills have affected every level of
*  education, what they should learn.
*  And so education for him, as I read it, is like the trifecta.
*  It's COVID, it's wokeness, it's conservatism, and it's where he's actually gotten a
*  bunch of things done.
*  It's also part of the anti-elitism argument.
*  Like who are these people to tell you what your children should be learning?
*  I'm fighting the elites who are trying to indoctrinate your kids.
*  You mentioned the lack of the economic story, the economic agenda.
*  I think where he tries to tell that story in terms of his governorship is through his
*  attacks on so-called woke capital.
*  And if someone can marry the anti-woke argument of the right to a real economic
*  agenda, then I think that would be something quite powerful.
*  I think I'm channeling our colleague Ross Douthat here in part.
*  I had a conversation with him about this and, you know, that's something that hasn't
*  been successfully done in the party so far.
*  But DeSantis' attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion policies in the business
*  world, his attacks on the way that Disney tried to get involved in the battles over
*  what is taught in schools in Florida.
*  You know, he can kind of wrap those into a story of woke capital, business world gone
*  awry, requirements and conditions for employment that no real American should have to count
*  in terms of DEI training and the like.
*  It seems very narrow, but I think that's a sliver that he is moving toward.
*  The attention he gives is fight with Disney.
*  And if people aren't familiar with this, Disney opposes what gets called the Don't Say Gay
*  Bill, which is about what you can teach kids in schools about gender identity, sexuality,
*  LGBT issues, et cetera.
*  And DeSantis responds by using the power of the state and a special session of the
*  legislature to take away special self-governing status Disney has had in Florida for a very
*  long time.
*  And they're still locked in battle.
*  It's something a lot of Republicans, including Trump and Christie, have been using to
*  attack DeSantis.
*  Disney is a pretty popular corporation.
*  And the idea that they're grooming children, as DeSantis' allies like to put it, is it has
*  a quality of like when McCarthy said the army was full of communists.
*  It's like, really, man, Disney doesn't like children.
*  And so it's become, I think, a bit of a weakness.
*  He really like he's ready to die on this hill throughout the book.
*  And what's interesting about it is almost more so than any other single place, although
*  there are a lot of places.
*  This is where I think he is showing he will go somewhere Trump didn't and that a lot of
*  Republicans wouldn't, which is to use the power of the state affirmatively to punish
*  even private corporations doing things he doesn't like.
*  I mean, he's got another area about trying to make it easier to sue big technology
*  companies. But one thing that is different between Ron DeSantis, 2023 and the Tea Party
*  types that he was one of in 2010 is this idea that the problem is not that the state is
*  intervening too much in the private market.
*  Like, that's the problem that is making us no longer a free society.
*  That in order now for us to be a free society, the state has to intervene more and punish
*  corporations that are becoming too woke, becoming too outspoken, becoming too far from
*  what the good, right thinking, God fearing citizens of the American heartland want.
*  And like, that's actually a very big shift.
*  I think it's a fairly frightening one because I mean, for obvious reasons of having a
*  president who wants to use the government that way.
*  But it is something that DeSantis is putting right at the core of his appeal.
*  I think the Ron DeSantis of 2010 would have some real words for the Ron DeSantis of 2023.
*  What he is doing in the battle against Disney sounds so much like the very things he
*  opposed about the Obama administration, you know, getting too involved in reshaping the
*  economy. This one is even more sort of specific and kind of narrow cast.
*  You know, the way he writes about it is like, you know, Disney getting involved in this
*  battle over parental rights and education is, quote, the textbook example of when a
*  corporation should stay out of politics.
*  This bill has nothing to do with Disney's business interests in Florida.
*  But who is Ron DeSantis to make that case, to decide what is in Disney's business
*  interests? You know, he says they're alienating their customers, they're bending to the
*  leftist rage mob.
*  But, you know, that's what the marketplace does.
*  If they're going to suffer consequences, they will suffer consequences from their
*  consumers. They don't need Ron DeSantis making that case.
*  And I think that this is something that could get him into real trouble in the primary
*  debate. I can see people coming after him for this when he says that we shouldn't
*  politicize the economy by having the CEO of Disney or a corporation like Disney
*  taking these kinds of stances.
*  I mean, he's the one doing the politicizing of the economy.
*  And he's essentially he admits to revoking Disney's, you know, self-governing status
*  just because he doesn't like their politics.
*  And that's not just terrifying to you, you know, as recline recipient of criticism in
*  DeSantis's first book, that'll be terrifying and concerning to just a lot of mainstream
*  Republicans.
*  Let me, to be fair, try to read Ron DeSantis's answer or justification both to that and to
*  probably what he would have thought in 2010.
*  He writes, towards the end, there is no doubt much to recommend this posture when the
*  institutions in society are healthy.
*  But we've seen institution after institution become thoroughly politicized.
*  Many are actively trying to impose an ideological agenda on society.
*  In this context, elected officials who do nothing more than get out of the way are
*  essentially green lighting these institutions to continue their unimpeded march through
*  society.
*  So that, to me, is in many ways a summation of almost the entire DeSantis case.
*  That if you do nothing, if you're just a typical small government conservative or you
*  don't know what you're doing and you're overmatched by the government like Donald Trump
*  was, you're essentially green lighting the march of, well, capital of the ruling class
*  and whatever you want to call it to take over society.
*  The only thing that will save you is somebody like DeSantis, who understands how to
*  weaponize the government against enemies, internal and external.
*  Like what he is saying in the way he governed Florida, in his ideological self testament,
*  and then in what he proposes doing or thinks the president should do is that it is time
*  for conservatives to take over the government and use the government to crush their foes.
*  But to do that, you have to have discipline, you have to have energy, you have to have a
*  plan. And like the guy who's got all that is Ron DeSantis.
*  Which is why this book, as we said at the beginning, is an enemies list.
*  It's the list of foes who must be crushed.
*  The way that I think that entire position falls apart and maybe not falls apart for a
*  Republican primary candidate, but it falls apart sort of logically, is that the blueprint
*  in the subtitle of the book, this is Florida's blueprint for America's revival, it implies
*  something that's far more systematic and coherent than is actually present in the book.
*  He is simply going after people who think differently from the way he does, right?
*  Whatever his impulses and interpretations of the moment are.
*  When he goes after Disney's governance or tax status, he's not making a statement about
*  how politics and business need to be separate.
*  He just doesn't like the stance Disney took.
*  I think the other place where DeSantis' fight against wokeness and his tendency to try to use
*  a state against his enemies, he suspends a prosecutor he doesn't like using powers the
*  Florida governor has, he increases penalties against rioters in Black Lives Matter protests,
*  is his argument that he is holding back the tide of crime in Florida.
*  That it's a big reason why people from New York and California are moving to Florida and
*  that this is something he can really run on.
*  I mean, he talks about crime being at a 50 year low.
*  We looked into this.
*  Florida has a higher homicide rate, as best we can tell.
*  The stat is not as good as one would wish it were than New York or California, which is
*  probably the best proxy for violent crime that we have.
*  But I was interested, by the way, you understood his narrativization of his record there.
*  Public safety is, I believe, the first thing he brings up when he sums up his record as
*  governor. It's public safety, woken indoctrination, protecting women's athletics,
*  election integrity, combating big tech, etc.
*  I don't think it's the one he devotes the most time to in this book, but it's certainly
*  it's sort of first among equals when he sums up his own record.
*  And this one, I think, is marginally related to the broader sort of populist and anti-elitist
*  case that he's making. But it's one where he can point to just a very specific outcome.
*  You know, like people like to live here.
*  People come to Florida because they think it's safe.
*  I mean, maybe they also come for low taxes.
*  But that's something that the DeSantis certainly highlights.
*  I don't know to what extent that will continue to be a major theme of the campaign.
*  Then always our final question.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  So right after saying that the bar is not high for political books, I want to recommend
*  three books by former presidents.
*  And what unites them is that they're not really about their time as president at all.
*  The first one I want to recommend is the memoirs by Ulysses Grant.
*  It covers his time at West Point fighting in the Mexican-American War, in the Civil War.
*  It ends before he gets to the presidency.
*  He wrote it in the last months of his life.
*  He was ill. He needed the money.
*  And that's a big reason that he wrote this book.
*  It is a lengthy book, a remarkable book.
*  It is funny. It is incisive.
*  He settles scores, especially with Robert E.
*  Lee, who he finds to be completely overrated and getting way too much good press, including
*  in the North. And it's just a wonderful reflection on leadership.
*  The next book I want to recommend is called An Hour Before Daylight.
*  And it's one of several memoirs that Jimmy Carter wrote.
*  This is about growing up on his father's farm in Georgia in the Depression.
*  And it is a surprisingly beautifully written book.
*  It was a Pulitzer finalist for biography in the early 2000s, which I didn't know until I
*  picked it up recently. And you see in part how he wanted nothing more as a child than to
*  be, than to run the farm, this kind of intricate machine, kind of clockwork machine that he
*  saw his father and his workers run.
*  And you see a little bit kind of why he was considered perhaps a bit of a micromanager
*  and in the weeds as president, because he he reveled in the details of farm life.
*  It's also an amazing book on pre-civil rights, race relations in Georgia at a very
*  complicated time. And the last book is a book of letters.
*  It's called All the Best by George Bush.
*  And it is a massive book.
*  It's about 700 or more pages.
*  And Bush got a lot of criticism for not being particularly articulate, for not capturing the
*  quote unquote vision thing.
*  But you really see who he is through his correspondence across the decades, from writing
*  his parents when he's aboard that submarine that saved him when he got shot down in the war, to
*  writing his kids and grandkids decades later when he is watching his son win the
*  presidential reelection.
*  It's a surprisingly touching book for a president who is often dinged for being a bit aloof.
*  So those are the three that I would I would recommend.
*  Carlos Azada, thank you very much.
