# Why Do So Few Democrats Want Biden to Run in 2024?
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [June 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHS_v0edmYE)
*  So Joe Biden is starting his 2024 campaign with a problem, which is that most people
*  don't want him to run again.
*  Even Democrats, when you just pull them, they are split on whether they want to see his
*  name on the ballot.
*  If you do head-to-head polling, Trump and DeSantis, they're often running ahead of him,
*  sometimes behind him, but definitely competitive.
*  So not a great place for Biden to begin.
*  I think particularly not a great place against Trump, who has certainly had a rough couple
*  of years, but also not completely unusual if you take the Trump weirdness out of it.
*  I mean, we went back in polling and around this point in their terms, Barack Obama and
*  Ronald Reagan, they also look pretty unsteady in the polls and they won reelection pretty easily.
*  So is Biden following in their footsteps?
*  Is he in a uniquely bad spot?
*  How does age play into this?
*  How does Trump play into this?
*  I wanted to spend an episode digging into the case for and against Biden.
*  I wanted to try to get both sides of it.
*  I wanted to do it with somebody who knows him and knows his team pretty well.
*  So I want to have Jon Favre on.
*  Jon Favre, of course, he was Barack Obama's chief speechwriter.
*  He's now, of course, one of the hosts of Pod Save America and one of the founders of Crooked
*  Media.
*  As always, my email is at nwytimes.com.
*  Jon Favre, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  So I want to do this by going through the questions and then the challenges Biden faces
*  in running for reelection and then looking at the strengths he has.
*  And so I guess the obvious place to begin is that most Americans don't want him to run
*  for reelection.
*  So there was a recent AP Nork poll found only 26 percent want him to run again.
*  Pretty standard from the polls I've seen.
*  Washington Post poll found Democrats are split 47-47 on whether he should run.
*  So what do you make of why so few Americans and even Democrats want to see his name on
*  the ballot in 2024?
*  So I think there's a few reasons for that.
*  I think the question, do you want an incumbent to run again?
*  Do you want an incumbent run again?
*  The numbers you get from that tend to be lower than approval ratings, horse race numbers,
*  et cetera.
*  So that's just like sort of an overall thing that happens in polling.
*  The next sort of level of this is as polarization has increased over the last decade or so,
*  voters tend to be unhappier with the state of affairs in politics, with incumbents, with
*  their choices in both parties.
*  So there's a general crankiness among voters that sort of seeps into most politicians'
*  approval ratings.
*  And then I think specific to Joe Biden, there are, of course, concerns about his age.
*  I did a bunch of focus groups in 2022.
*  And it's not necessarily the criticism that you hear from Republicans, which is like,
*  you know, he's completely senile and someone else is running the government and he's just
*  a puppet and all that kind of stuff.
*  It's more they thought when they elected Joe Biden the first time that he was going to
*  be a bridge to the next generation, that even though he didn't say it, that the implication
*  was that he was going to serve one term.
*  And now, you know, they think he's getting up there in age and they are a little uncomfortable
*  about that.
*  Let's do age directly.
*  I had this for a little later in the conversation.
*  We were going to work up to it.
*  But when I talk to people and when I've looked at focus groups, this is the thing I hear
*  the most about.
*  So, I mean, obviously, Biden, oldest president in U.S. history, he'd be 86 at the end of
*  a second term, two thirds of Americans in a Quinnipiac poll thought he was too old to
*  run.
*  And one of the particular things I hear from Democrats is that you don't have to buy any
*  of the Republican senility, arguments or insinuations to worry that he's got this terrible vulnerability,
*  which is that there is this lurking fear about him and that if during the campaign
*  he gets a bad flu and he's got to be off the trail for a week, something like his recent
*  stumble over a sandbag happens in a more dramatic way.
*  Sort of think back to Bob Dole falling off the stage in 96.
*  And it crystallizes fears of his age in a way that his campaign then can't answer because
*  people already felt this.
*  And now you have this memeable moment that makes them certain of it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's hard to separate.
*  What you just laid out concern voters and Democrats because him tripping over a sandbag
*  makes them think that he's not fit for the job or that they think that that will become
*  memeable and that other people and other voters will worry that he's not fit for the job.
*  That will hurt him politically.
*  And I talk about that difference because when you really push people on this and you push
*  voters on this, a lot of it is punditry.
*  And I'm not saying that's not fair because voters act like pundits now and because they're
*  especially those who consume a lot of news.
*  And I think there's a difference between worrying that his age will be a political factor and
*  actually worrying about his age as you go to cast a vote and say, oh, can he actually
*  do this job?
*  And I do think that you could have one of those moments in the campaign.
*  But I also think there's like plenty of them that have been flying all over TikTok and
*  everywhere else.
*  So it's like, I don't actually know that another stumble or something like that is going to
*  change the equation.
*  I think it's kind of baked into a lot of the media that people are consuming and a lot
*  of the understanding that people already have about Biden's age.
*  I think the deeper fear is the other one you get at.
*  I think there's something there, not that he's senile, but just that the rigors of
*  a campaign at this age are going to be too much for him in a way that's going to make
*  him less effective, that he actually just would be less effective as president.
*  I mean, I think this is a genuinely fair concern.
*  The Times did a focus group recently when people were asked who were Biden voters if
*  they thought he'd be up to the job at 86, which would be how old he'd be at the end
*  of the second term, not a single hand went up.
*  I do get the sense that there is a kind of resentment among many Democrats at feeling
*  a little bit forced into this position.
*  They thought he'd serve a term.
*  They think this is getting too old to run again.
*  And while they're not going to vote for Trump over him, they're mad and genuinely concerned
*  about whether or not this is the right choice.
*  So the White House, whenever they're asked about this, and I think there was a story
*  recently in the New York Times that Peter Baker wrote about Biden's age and sort of
*  the White House's case is his schedule is still quite busy.
*  He is still doing multiple events per day.
*  He goes on these foreign trips and he's up at all hours.
*  He did that surprise trip to Ukraine where he's on the train for many hours and he's
*  like barely sleeping.
*  And so, you know, they talk about all this.
*  I had wondered for a while, like how much of that was spin from the White House and
*  how much of it was real.
*  And then I went to the White House in December and I was there to interview Ron Klain for
*  Paz de America and I brought my family because my family was in town.
*  And so my wife was there with me and our son and my wife's parents.
*  And I come back from interviewing Ron and in my old speechwriting office because the
*  Biden speechwriter now we all know very well is my whole family and Joe Biden is sitting
*  there because he runs into my mother-in-law at the White House mess, sees her and said,
*  I remember you.
*  He remembered meeting her in 2018 at an event, knew who she was, clocked that she was
*  related to me through marriage, remembered my father-in-law, my father-in-law, federal
*  judge appointed by Obama, and then decided to spend like an hour with us in the middle
*  of the day, took us up to the Oval, started pointing out pictures, told a whole bunch
*  of stories. And what I took from the whole episode was it's so very Joe Biden and that
*  like on one hand he was incredibly kind, gracious with his time, very sharp, like
*  remembered everything.
*  And then he was also like telling us stories about the Robert Bork confirmation to my
*  father-in-law that just like lasted a long, long time.
*  But for me, and when I think this gets to the age thing, which is like he's always been
*  like that, like when he was vice president back in 2009 and 10, when I first got to the
*  White House, he was telling long, long stories.
*  Right. The stutter that he deals with has always been there.
*  His tendency to gaffe has always been there.
*  I think as he gets older and now that age is an issue, all of these other sort of issues
*  that he has had over the years as a politician, sometimes being long winded, the stutter,
*  saying things that he's not supposed to say, those all get magnified by the age.
*  But I came away thinking like the guy's still pretty sharp.
*  Like he didn't seem like he lost a step.
*  He does shuffle a little more.
*  Right. Like there's a little bit of a shuffle there.
*  His voice is a little quieter, but as far as mental acuity, I did not see any any reason
*  for concern. Now, the question is, how do you communicate that to the rest of the electorate?
*  Because that's quite difficult to do.
*  It's not like everyone's going to get to meet Joe Biden, you know, and spend some time
*  with him.
*  Well, there is this interesting other side of it that I feel like I've seen play out a few
*  times for him, which is Biden does not lean forward that much into a dominant public
*  persona, not in the way Trump did, not in the way Obama did.
*  And so that leaves more room for narratives about him to be out there.
*  Like Joe Biden has not done even one interview with a major newspaper, not done any
*  interviews with, say, interview podcasters for major newspapers.
*  Ahem. Ahem. And same man.
*  Yeah. Right. And we've been trying on Potsdam America for a while.
*  And obviously he could put all these questions to rest if he would come on on the
*  Ezra Klein show. But I think there's a suspicion on the one hand that one reason
*  that's going on is they don't trust him or he doesn't trust himself to be out mixing
*  it up. And if he was mixing it up and it was going well, people wouldn't feel this
*  way. On the other hand, it has created the sort of constant exceeding of a low
*  expectation for him. I saw this very clearly during the State of the Union.
*  I feel like there's a sense that not really based on anything because he keeps giving
*  tons of totally normal speeches, but he went up, he gave a good State of the Union.
*  He mixed it up with Republicans on Medicare and Social Security in an impromptu way.
*  And you could almost feel not just like the relief, but the sense that he had way cleared
*  the bar people had in their head for him.
*  And so there is this way in which so long as he actually is fine, which is, you know,
*  the reports I get from the people who work with him, that I don't want to call it an
*  advantage. But because Republicans keep trying to suggest the guy is actually senile and
*  he's not, it allows him to continuously vault over the expectations in a way that
*  is politically useful for him.
*  Yes, they have drawn the caricature in such an exaggerated way that he doesn't have to
*  do much to show people that he is not that caricature.
*  I'm glad you mentioned the State of the Union. I was just about to say that.
*  I thought that was interesting because if you go back and watch that State of the Union,
*  he does stumble a few different places in that speech.
*  But that was not the story.
*  The story was him mixing it up with Republicans ad libbing, showing some fight, showing
*  some energy. And look, I think that there is a risk.
*  If you're the White House and Joe Biden's your guy, there's of course a risk putting him
*  out. Is he going to make a gaffe?
*  Right. Is he going to stumble over something?
*  Is there going to be a memeable moment here?
*  Right. So that's always a risk.
*  But I also think that he is at his best when he is off the cuff, showing energy, showing
*  some fight, talking with people sort of one on one because he's really good with people.
*  And I think you've got to weigh the risks of having the occasional gaffe or stumble
*  against the risk of not ever letting him go out there and mix it up.
*  Because then, as you mentioned, I think the narrative about him takes hold.
*  And yes, it sets a low bar for him to clear.
*  But how many people are going to tune in when he finally steps out and gives a speech or
*  does the interview? Right. And so I would like find opportunities to sort of I don't
*  want to do the very cliche, let Biden be Biden, but like, let him mix it up and have a
*  little fun and show some fight because, yeah, that will definitely lead to a gaffe or two.
*  But I think I would rather have the gaffe or two, but then also have people see him
*  and be like, oh, yeah, that's the Joe Biden I know.
*  He was funny there. He was taking it to Republicans there.
*  Or he was really kind to that lady he met in line.
*  Like those moments are so much more valuable than dealing with the occasional gaffe.
*  So one thing about the Biden age concerns is they make Vice President Kamala Harris
*  very, maybe even unusually important.
*  But polls find her to be more unpopular than Biden, not less.
*  She's had I think it's fair to say, and this is very widely reported, a pretty challenging
*  run of it. She's had a ton of staff turnover.
*  There's a sense she's not found a strong footing as Vice President and would be a weaker
*  candidate than Biden. And so there's this fear and I hear it from Democrats that voters
*  who like Biden fine but worry about his age, they don't look at her and are comforted.
*  So how do you think about her role in this campaign?
*  This is what's really tough, right, is because so often the presidential candidate
*  picks a vice president or at least in recent times, right, whether it's Dick Cheney or
*  Joe Biden, you pick a vice president who like you're a little less experienced as the
*  candidate. And so the vice president is this very experienced politician, official,
*  elected official who's who's been around a long time.
*  And so you feel safe if something happens that they could step in.
*  In a way, even Pence was that.
*  Yes, that's right. Even Pence was that.
*  And this was really flipped on its head with Biden choosing Kamala Harris.
*  And he also chooses her after her campaign does not do as well as it was expected.
*  Right. So she already has run this campaign that either people did not really remember
*  it. She didn't really break through.
*  Or to the extent that she did, people were not that impressed.
*  And then she goes into a job which is sort of like designed to hide you, frustrate you,
*  keep you out of the spotlight.
*  You end up doing the shitty jobs.
*  And if you don't have a profile that pre-exists your job as vice president and you
*  don't have name ID and people don't have a good sense of who you are, then I think it's
*  really difficult in that job to introduce yourselves to voters in a way that's going
*  to make them feel comfortable.
*  I always think about Kamala Harris like there are things she can control and things that
*  she cannot. She cannot control that she is the first black woman to serve as vice
*  president. And I imagine that to become the highest ranking black woman in the United
*  States to ever serve in office, that is a tightrope to walk that I think by design
*  makes you cautious that you deal with sexism and racism that others have not had to
*  deal with. So these are all things that she cannot control.
*  In the category of things that you can control is what your message is, what you care
*  about, what your passion is.
*  I would expect that as she gears up for this campaign, they're going to want her to
*  sort of have a message that helps her stand out as an individual.
*  Right. So already she's been like out there talking about choice.
*  Like that's sort of the issue that she's trying to make her mark on as an advocate.
*  And then I think traditionally the vice president in a reelection campaign tends to
*  draw the contrast with the other ticket.
*  And I think she's quite good at that when she goes on the offense against Republicans.
*  So I would expect that she would sort of get out there more as like a bit of a fighter
*  trying to draw a contrast to Trump or whoever the Republican nominee is and sort of get
*  a higher profile that way.
*  If you want to take the dark Brandon approach on this for people familiar with that
*  reference, I sometimes think it helps Biden in terms of that intra-party tension and
*  pressure that his vice president is rightly or wrongly perceived as politically weaker
*  than he is. I mean, if you imagine a world where his VP was extremely well liked, like
*  Joe Biden, but younger and better now, I think that'd be leading to much louder calls and
*  a lot more pressure for him to step aside.
*  But the fact that there isn't a consensus or even a belief in the party that the Harris
*  could outdo him in 2024 has really muted that.
*  So on the one hand, he's not facing a primary, which we'll talk about at some point, but
*  on the other, he's also not facing this kind of pressure to do that generational turnover.
*  Well, and by the way, if you are the Biden White House, and I'm sure that the VP and
*  her staff feel this too, that's part of the reason that they don't want to like put her
*  out there all the time.
*  Because and that's true of every president vice president relationship, right?
*  Like you never want the vice president to outshine the president.
*  I think for the reason that you just mentioned, especially in this case, they didn't want
*  at least when they started, when they got to the White House, they didn't want like
*  Kamala Harris looking like this rising star because it starts raising questions about,
*  OK, well, then why is Joe Biden going to run again?
*  So 538 has a mid 41.2% approval as we're talking.
*  And it's not a great rating, but something we were doing in preparation for this episode
*  was going back and looking at other presidents.
*  And, you know, you go back to 1982, only 36% of voters in one poll we found wanted
*  Ronald Reagan to run again.
*  At about this point in his presidency, Reagan was at 43%.
*  Barack Obama was bouncing around the mid to low 40s for much of his third year.
*  I'm old enough to remember in Obama's third year when there was so much concern about
*  his reelection campaign that there were endless stories about how he should drop the
*  deadweight of Joe Biden and bring the political juggernaut of Hillary Clinton in as his
*  vice president to shake things up.
*  You might you might have some recollection of that as well.
*  I do. I do. Yeah.
*  And so I'm curious how you think about this historically.
*  Like is maybe the third year is just this kind of doldrums year quite often.
*  Yeah, no, the same thing happened with us in 2011.
*  Obama was dealing with the debt ceiling negotiations and his approval rating after that
*  was at its low point in the eight years he served in office.
*  But that's why when we were thinking about the reelect from the very beginning, our
*  theory was, of course, we got to turn it into a choice and not a referendum.
*  And we got to have a theory of the case and we got to have a message.
*  And that became Barack Obama going out there and talking about sort of defending the
*  middle class as the defining issue of our time.
*  And it worked even better for us because Mitt Romney was the nominee.
*  But whoever was the Republican nominee, we were going to still have that same message.
*  And it was a message about Barack Obama in the middle of a fight for people against
*  powerful interests. Right.
*  That was like the core of our reelection message.
*  And I could actually imagine Joe Biden's message along those lines with some additions
*  that we can talk about later.
*  So I want to get to the Biden message in a sec.
*  But as the bridge there.
*  I think if I am looking at Biden's numbers and I'm Joe Biden campaign person, I think
*  the one that worries me the most is that he is not trusted on the economy, that voters
*  don't think he's doing a good job on the economy, that Donald Trump is significantly
*  more trusted on the economy when you match them up.
*  Trump is doing much better in terms of who people trust on the economy, even than he's
*  doing in the head to head race with Joe Biden.
*  Biden's had a, you know, I mean, there's been inflation, but it's coming down.
*  They've had a very tight labor market the whole time.
*  They got through the debt ceiling pretty smoothly.
*  They've got a lot of policy that they actually passed on economics, particularly long term
*  policy. How do you think about why he is not pulling higher there?
*  I think inflation is probably the biggest explanation, even though it's coming down.
*  It's still high for people.
*  But I think beyond inflation, it's sort of the same anxiety that we have seen from
*  voters as far back as when Barack Obama was president and was we were recovering from
*  the Great Recession.
*  Right. Like the cost of living for so many people is so high right now.
*  When I did focus groups in 22, when I did like all kinds of different demographics,
*  different parts of the country, different ages, I asked everyone to start what's the
*  most pressing issue for you?
*  Just open ended question.
*  And I did hear a lot about inflation, but specifically I heard about housing and the
*  cost of housing rent.
*  I'm never going to own a house.
*  I'm going to have to live with my parents.
*  I'm going to have to live with roommates.
*  And I bring that up because these are sort of cost of living issues that have been with
*  us for quite a while before inflation hit.
*  And I think when you talk to voters about what's on their mind, they will complain that
*  they're working harder and not getting ahead.
*  We have heard that complaint, like I said, as far back as when Barack Obama was president.
*  And I think whoever the incumbent is, that blows back on them.
*  Why Trump gets those high numbers is I do think that, you know, there was a little bit
*  of Trump's an asshole, but he's a business guy.
*  And so at least he knows the economy and maybe the economy was doing fairly well before
*  COVID came. And so Trump's whole story that he's going to tell, which was everything was
*  wonderful in the economy until COVID hit, will probably ring true to more voters than
*  we might expect, partly because memories are short and partly just because it makes sense
*  to people to think, oh, well, before COVID, everything was great.
*  So now I want to turn to the case for Biden, the strengths he actually has, and maybe a
*  good place to begin is a case he's begun making for himself.
*  So you listen to his announcement video for 2024.
*  Yeah. You're hearing the way he's framing the race.
*  Like, how would you describe where they're starting out on their message?
*  They're starting out right where they left off in the midterms, 22, which, you know, is
*  interesting if you remember, there was this sort of debate right before the midterms.
*  Biden is talking a lot about democracy.
*  He's talking a lot about abortion.
*  Is he not talking about inflation enough?
*  Is he not talking about kitchen table issues enough?
*  And as someone who came of age during the Obama years, when the central issue was the
*  size and role of government and the economy and all that, I wondered that myself, and
*  especially I had talked to voters and voters top concern is inflation in the economy.
*  But, and I know you have talked to Lynn Fabric before, political scientist, UCLA, and she
*  did this very huge survey of voting behavior in 2020.
*  And the main finding there is that when you ask voters, when you make them rank which
*  issues are most important to them vis-a-vis other issues, issues related to identity
*  rise to the top of the list, even though those voters might say they care a lot about
*  economic issues, when they're actually voting, they are thinking about issues related to
*  identity, cultural issues, social issues, much more than you might think.
*  And so this is all to say that in 22, I think one of the reasons that Democrats and
*  especially Biden hit so hard on democracy and abortion and voting rights and all of
*  these issues is because I think they know that for whatever reason, and we can talk
*  about some of the possibilities why, people are not necessarily just voting on pocketbook
*  issues, even though those pocketbook issues are super important to them, that when they're
*  making their choice between Democrats and Republicans, and especially this Republican
*  Party that's so extreme, they are thinking about issues related to identity, all of these
*  culture wars and a lot of these social issues, because that's where they see the biggest
*  difference between the parties right now.
*  Let's talk about that in context of 2022, because when I talk to people involved in the
*  Biden campaign and planning out the Biden 2024 race, I will do the thing I did with you
*  at the beginning of this conversation, and I will read them these numbers they already
*  know about how people don't want Biden to run and his approval rating is bad, and he's
*  not trusted on the economy.
*  And the first thing they will say to me is that was true last year, too.
*  And yet, while everybody was predicting a Democratic wipeout, we performed historically
*  well for a governing party in the midterm.
*  And we did so despite those numbers being rough.
*  They'll say that the historical trend does not hold for one reason or another for Biden,
*  where a soft approval rating leads to poor performance for him or his party.
*  So how do you read 2022 from that perspective?
*  Yeah, I do think that in 2022, what you had was Dobbs being a gigantic issue for people
*  because they actually saw that the Republicans were trying to take something away, trying
*  to take a benefit away, in this case, the right to make your own health care decisions.
*  And when I ask people about inflation in these focus groups, they complain a lot about
*  inflation. And then I would say, whose fault is this?
*  And they actually wouldn't say it's all Joe Biden's fault.
*  They would not blame Joe Biden necessarily for the inflation.
*  They were grumpy about it. They were grumpy about him, but they didn't blame him for it.
*  Then you start talking about abortion.
*  And there they understand the differences between the parties in a much clearer way.
*  When you talk about January 6th and you talk about overturning elections and you talk
*  about election deniers, they understand the difference between the parties there in a
*  much clearer way. When you talk about the economy and you talk about different economic
*  plans, people tend to support the Democratic plans for the economy over the Republican
*  plans. But they also kind of don't think that either party is going to fix anything
*  when it comes to the economy. They don't know that the Democrats are actually going to
*  get their plans through. Or if they do get their plans through on the economy, they're
*  not necessarily convinced that it's going to improve their life.
*  And they don't think that the Republicans plan, they're going to improve their lives
*  either. So if the economy then is like a wash, then they go to some of the cultural and
*  social issues where they can see the difference every day when they're consuming news
*  about politics.
*  So we just got this really big report from Catalyst, which is this firm that has really
*  deep voter files and can it takes them some time but can really see what happens in an
*  election in very granular detail.
*  And the main thing they found was really interesting to me, which is that if you looked
*  at it nationally, Republicans did have the advantage.
*  It wasn't quite a wave, but actually it kind of looked like it would have been except,
*  except that Democrats way outperformed what you would expect in competitive races.
*  And they particularly outperformed when you had a very Trumpy candidate, right?
*  They find a one to four point penalty for an election denying candidate, which I think
*  they take correctly as a correlate of being very Trumpy.
*  So what does that weird overperformance in competitive races tell you?
*  Well, it tells me that campaigns actually matter.
*  Candidates actually matter.
*  Of course, in a very calcified electorate, they matter on the margin.
*  But in a divided electorate, the margin means everything.
*  And I think that the Democrats did a very good job of selecting candidates who were
*  mainstream Democratic candidates, right?
*  They're necessarily centrist.
*  They're necessarily super progressive, but they were like mainstream Democratic
*  candidates, good resumes, good bios, particularly in these competitive districts.
*  And Republicans, you know, they had these Republican primaries and in almost every
*  instance, the more extreme mega candidate wins.
*  And I'll just use the sort of flip side of this as an example of why this mattered so
*  much in Georgia.
*  Stacey Abrams runs against Brian Kemp and Brian Kemp, by all accounts, is as
*  conservative as any of these other Republicans running.
*  In terms of issues, he signs a six week abortion ban.
*  There's all kinds of voting issues from Abrams Kemp's 2018 race, right?
*  But because he stood up to Donald Trump and didn't let Donald Trump steal the election
*  in Georgia, he was perceived by that electorate as more moderate than he actually is.
*  So what happened is these Republicans who ran as like unabashed Trump fans, proud
*  election deniers, of course, there was a penalty there because voters could see that
*  they were more extreme than the typical Republican.
*  Now, fast forward to what we're about to face in 2024 and what Joe Biden and his team
*  have been doing. If you look at the debt ceiling fight we just had, part of the Biden
*  strategy there was to say, look, I can negotiate with Speaker McCarthy and some
*  reasonable Republicans who did not want the country to default, even though they
*  certainly threaten that.
*  But then there were these other extreme Republicans, these extreme Magg Republicans
*  that did want the country to default, that did want to do all these extreme things.
*  And so what I did as president is I both fought the extremism and negotiated the
*  bipartisan deal.
*  Voters say they want they want parties to get together and they don't want extremes.
*  And Joe Biden is fighting the extreme MAGA, but he's also giving Republicans and
*  independents who also think that MAGA is extreme a place to come home to.
*  This is a thing that I think is a quiet advantage for him.
*  And I suspect this can be a pretty big part of Biden 2024 storytelling.
*  So if you go back to the State of the Union, he says, he brags, I signed over 300
*  bipartisan laws since becoming president.
*  And he gives a couple of examples, reauthorizing the Violence Against Women
*  Act, which was a big original accomplishment for him, the Electoral
*  Account Reform Act.
*  But he does get through the debt ceiling fairly smoothly.
*  The bipartisan infrastructure bill is a big deal.
*  The CHIPS Act and the CHIPS and Science Act is a big deal.
*  These are bipartisan achievements.
*  I think he's got a case to make here.
*  I do too.
*  And I don't, I'm not quite sure how much that will matter with voters because I
*  don't know how much voters are paying attention to all the bipartisan deals and
*  bipartisan legislation that has come out of Washington.
*  The CHIPS Act doesn't have a very high name ID, but as far back as 2020 and even
*  before, voters saw Joe Biden and see Joe Biden as someone who is willing to
*  negotiate and willing to be bipartisan.
*  And he certainly has proof points on that.
*  And so I do think that that will help him.
*  I also think this is like by necessity, like the Democratic coalition necessitates
*  this kind of politics because of how big it has to be in a country where the
*  institutions are counter majoritarian.
*  And so in order to win the electoral college, in order to win in the Senate, you
*  need a coalition that spans from fans of AOC to fans of Joe Manchin and probably
*  never Trumpers and all kinds of people like that.
*  And that is the only way that Democrats can actually win just because of the
*  electoral college and because of the way the Senate is.
*  And so Republicans don't have that.
*  And so Republicans don't necessarily need to be talking about bipartisanship
*  because they have a more conservative, more right wing base that they can depend
*  on to win.
*  They're not worried about as much trying to get those voters in the middle.
*  We need more people and we need more people.
*  We need a much more heterodox coalition than they do.
*  So when I think back to 2012 and I think back to the Democratic convention that
*  year, a huge amount of effort goes in to having not just Obama, but other key
*  messengers in the Democratic party.
*  Bill Clinton is a huge player in that convention.
*  Tell this story of what Obama faced and then this narrative of the policy he
*  actually passed.
*  And it works, right?
*  Obama has a big win in 2012.
*  So let's say you're doing the speech here and you're trying to narrativeize the
*  Biden policy agenda, because as you mentioned a second ago, people aren't
*  paying that much attention to the Chips and Science Act passing, but it did pass
*  and a lot has passed and a lot that people don't really know about because
*  these bills are so big has passed.
*  So you're the speechwriter.
*  You're writing for Joe Biden or you're writing for Barack Obama to come and
*  make the case for Joe Biden.
*  What is your accomplishments narrative?
*  It's funny you mentioned 2012 and that convention because when I was working on
*  Obama's speech, we very intentionally didn't want to just talk about
*  accomplishments and just have accomplishments because what we had been
*  struggling with since we got to the White House was, okay, we're recovering
*  from this great recession and Obama has achieved a lot, but people are still
*  feeling pretty bad about the economy.
*  There's still a lot of job loss.
*  And so if you go out there and start touting accomplishments, when people
*  aren't really feeling that in their lives, there's going to be a disconnect
*  there that's going to run down to the Republican benefit.
*  So we were very careful in how we talked about the accomplishments.
*  Bill Clinton goes out there and basically just explains why Barack Obama has been
*  great and all the accomplishments that he has done and all that kind of stuff.
*  And the chattering classes, the press, pundits, democratic activists loved it.
*  They thought it was great because they had been like thirsting for that.
*  You know, they wanted someone to just be boasting about what
*  Barack Obama actually did.
*  I don't think it works with voters as well.
*  And I still don't think that because you go and talk to people who tell you that
*  they're struggling, tell you that they can't afford housing, tell you that they
*  can't afford healthcare, and you say, yeah, but what about the CHIPS Act and what
*  about the infrastructure bill and what about this?
*  And it doesn't register with them because they're not seeing that in their own lives.
*  Now, I don't think that means you don't talk about accomplishments.
*  To the extent that you talk about accomplishments, you don't frame them as
*  a report card that shows you deserve the job.
*  You frame them as proof points that you're taking on the fights that matter to people.
*  And you promise that you'll keep taking those fights on.
*  And as Biden has been saying, finish the job.
*  Right.
*  So there was this great line I thought in the Oval Office address that Biden
*  recently gave about the debt ceiling deal.
*  And he sort of goes through, he talks about it, talks about all the things that
*  he stopped from happening, all the things he was able to protect, social security,
*  Medicare, et cetera.
*  And then at one point he says, you know, there were all these loopholes, these tax
*  loopholes for the wealthy, for big oil and for crypto and hedge fund managers.
*  And Republicans wanted to protect everyone.
*  And I don't.
*  And then he said, but I'm going to be coming back and with your help, I'm going to win.
*  And I think that if I were Biden's speechwriters and Biden's campaign, I would frame
*  the accomplishments and frame the entire message as we are in the middle of this
*  fight. And on the other side is a group of people who want to take away your right
*  to choose how many kids you have and when they want to tell your kids which books to
*  read. They want to take away your health care.
*  They want to materially harm your life.
*  And if you give them the chance, if you put them in power, so they're controlling
*  Washington. These are the things that they will do.
*  And here's what I will do.
*  And you know that I'll do it.
*  You know that I'll fight hard because I've been doing it for the last four years and
*  I'm not done yet. And we haven't finished, but we're making progress.
*  And if you put me back in there, I will keep fighting these fights on behalf of you.
*  I mean, this gets to the other side of it, which is that there's a question of can you
*  get people to vote for you because they like you, they think you've done a great job.
*  And can you get people to vote against the other side because they're frankly terrified
*  of what they'll do if they come into power?
*  One thing I've heard about Biden and the Democrats in 2022 is that there are a lot of
*  voters who somewhat disapproved of Joe Biden.
*  They didn't think he was doing a great job.
*  And an unusual number of them voted for Democrats, voted for Biden and Democrats to
*  have more power. And the catalyst data shows the Democrats did particularly well among
*  young voters. And if you want to think about a class of voters that Biden does not connect
*  to that well, young voters, right?
*  Young voters like Elizabeth Warren, they like Bernie Sanders.
*  They did not connect to Joe Biden, different generation, different kind of Democrat from
*  them a lot of the time. But they turned out in huge numbers.
*  I mean, they really were the difference for Democrats in 2022.
*  And I suspect a lot of that is because they're pretty terrified of the Republicans, of
*  Dobs, of January 6, of what just Republicans represent and want to do.
*  And this feels like something that Biden understands pretty deeply, that even more so, I
*  think, than in 2012 say, you don't have to like Joe Biden to vote for him.
*  He doesn't have to be your dream presidential candidate, but he's a tool against
*  letting Trump and Republicans like Trump back into power.
*  And that that's fundamentally the choice here.
*  And the sort of young voter performance in 2022 strikes me as some evidence that they're
*  right about that.
*  Yeah, I mean, I did one focus group of diverse group of like college age voters in Orange
*  County and then I did-
*  Orange County, California?
*  Orange County, California.
*  My hometown.
*  There you go. And then I did one in Atlanta with like young black voters in their 20s.
*  And those two groups out of all the groups, the view of Joe Biden was quite bleak.
*  They did not think he was doing a great job.
*  They were upset about the idea that he was going to run again.
*  They thought he was too old.
*  He doesn't understand their issues, all that kind of other stuff.
*  Then you start talking about the Republicans and they were all terrified.
*  This is right around Dobs and they were terrified about Dobs.
*  They were terrified about election deniers.
*  They were terrified about what was going to happen with climate change.
*  They were angry.
*  They were scared.
*  And even I remember in the Atlanta group, it was probably the most negative group about
*  Biden that I had heard and Kamala Harris.
*  And like they weren't even that excited about Stacey Abrams, which really surprised me.
*  And then at the end I said, okay, well, is anyone voting for Herschel Walker?
*  And they all said, no, are you crazy?
*  Of course I'm not voting for Herschel Walker.
*  Are you voting for Brian Kemp?
*  No, I'm not going to vote for- not as much as Herschel Walker, which, you know, should
*  tell you something, but they weren't quite as negative towards Brian Kemp.
*  But in every single focus group I did, the same thing happened.
*  It was the same pattern.
*  Unhappiness with Biden, disappointment.
*  But as soon as you bring up Trump, as soon as you bring up Trump-like Republicans and
*  the choices there, they automatically go back with Biden and go with the Democrats.
*  So I have a theory about this in Biden that I want to try out on you, which is that I
*  think Biden's kind of soft approval ratings.
*  And you can tell me if you think this is wrong, but just experientially, I don't think
*  Democrats like Joe Biden the way they liked some of the other Democratic presidents or
*  standard bears of my lifetime.
*  But that that is actually the flip side of something he does that has helped make him
*  successful, which is that he doesn't really create all that much for Democrats to
*  rally around. He's not trying to take up that much political space.
*  You know, as we mentioned earlier, doesn't give a ton of interviews, but he doesn't
*  take a bunch of shots in his speeches.
*  I mean, there are ways, you know, this much better than me as a former speechwriter.
*  If you want to get the president to be the person leading the news, there are ways to
*  do it. And Biden lets those pitches go by, like day after day.
*  They just don't try to do that.
*  But what that means is they create and leave a lot of open space for Republicans to be
*  the headline figures in the news and for Republicans to over and over again, so to
*  speak, show who they are for Trump to continue being a headline figure in the news
*  and for Republicans to motivate Democrats against them.
*  In many ways, one of Biden's strengths as a politician, I think, is that he doesn't get
*  in the way of Republicans motivating Democrats.
*  Right. Biden is he's often a kind of pretty broad canvas on which a lot of kinds of
*  opposition Republicans can operate through him.
*  He doesn't turn off that many Democrats for the same reason he doesn't light them up,
*  because he's kind of letting Republicans be the energy in his own coalition.
*  I think that's definitely part of what he's doing.
*  I also think it is just the political context that we're all living in right now.
*  And I think that Biden and his team recognize, which is the Republican Party is now so
*  extreme, has gone so far to the right, so far outside the mainstream that they have
*  left sort of a broad, broad middle of fundamentally American values that a
*  Democratic candidate like Joe Biden can easily embrace and stand for and reclaim.
*  And so in Biden's announcement video, right, it was a very patriotic video.
*  I believe the first ad that ran was called the flag.
*  And it's very, you know, we claim this flag and we believe in freedom and opportunity.
*  And what the Republicans have done by going so far to the right is that they have left
*  open to the Democratic Party, sort of this very large, broad coalition where you can
*  appeal to a lot of people and a lot of different kinds of voters by just not being as crazy
*  as they are. And I think Biden understands that and is actually a good fit for this
*  moment because he's never been the kind of politician that has embraced those kinds of
*  extreme tactics or rhetoric or even tried to get himself in the news with potshots,
*  like the kind that you're talking about.
*  So let's talk a bit about some of the possible matchups here because we're beginning to see the
*  Republican field take shape.
*  So front runners, Trump, polling in the 50s in the Republican field.
*  If you get a Biden Trump rematch, how does that differ in your view from 2020?
*  So the advantage for Trump, I think, in that rematch is that Trump goes back to being a
*  challenger where he's always more comfortable.
*  So the whole pitch in 2016 was all these politicians screwed everything up, especially
*  the Democrats. I'm an outsider.
*  I can take on the establishment.
*  If you're pissed about the way things are going, vote for me.
*  Right. That's like the nicest version of Trump's message.
*  Obviously, there was a lot of other stuff thrown in there.
*  In 2020, he was the incumbent.
*  And so he was saddled with people's dissatisfaction with the state of the country, the state of the
*  economy, the pandemic.
*  And he had to deal with all of that.
*  Now he gets to go back to saying, oh, it wasn't so bad when I was in office.
*  And now I'm the challenger and I'm the outsider again.
*  And so, you know, put me in there and I can fix things again.
*  So that's what the advantage to Trump is.
*  I think the advantage for Biden and sort of an obvious one is, you know, Trump didn't leave on
*  great terms. And most people in this country have formed an opinion of Donald Trump.
*  And the opinion is not good.
*  And most people don't want him to run again.
*  And he is an extremely polarizing figure.
*  And he still does poorly with independents.
*  And he still does poorly with a lot of the voters who cast a ballot for him in 2016 and
*  then decided to vote for Joe Biden in 2020.
*  And he is still losing among voters who are dissatisfied with both Joe Biden and Donald
*  Trump, people who don't like both of them.
*  Biden is still winning those voters.
*  He won them in 2020.
*  Trump won those voters in 2016 when it was people who didn't like Trump or Hillary Clinton.
*  Trump won those voters by a lot.
*  So I think the advantage that Biden has in a Trump-Biden rematch is, look, we're
*  rerunning the last race.
*  He won the last race.
*  How many people who voted for Joe Biden over Donald Trump in 2020 are going to say,
*  yeah, you know what, I'm going to go back to Trump now.
*  And now, again, it could happen.
*  It could be a small number of people that just tipped the race in those key states.
*  But if I'm the Biden folks, that's why I probably like that matchup.
*  So behind Trump on the Republican side is DeSantis.
*  And DeSantis is a place where one of the Biden team's best arguments, which is that
*  Democrats performed really well in 2022, falls apart.
*  Because they did get crushed in Florida and DeSantis is not going to let anybody
*  forget that, correctly so, if you're on his political team.
*  So what do you make of a DeSantis-Biden match?
*  So if you'd asked me this six months ago, I would tell you that it concerns me.
*  It concerns me a lot more than the Trump-Biden matchup.
*  After DeSantis' not just his performance, but the press he's gotten, what people
*  have gotten to know about him over the last several months, it's now for me a
*  toss-up whether I'm worried more about a DeSantis-Biden matchup or a Trump-Biden
*  matchup, because you see this in focus groups now, you see it in polling,
*  independent voters, swing voters, sort of the middle of the road voters that
*  Biden will need to win, they now see DeSantis as an extreme Republican.
*  There was a moment, I think, where they thought, oh, you know, he's conservative
*  and all, but he's not quite as right-wing as Trump, or he's not as scary
*  as Trump, or he's not, you know, all that.
*  And I think whether it's him going after Disney, whether it's the six-week
*  abortion ban, there is a perception of DeSantis now in the electorate, to the
*  extent that people know him, that he is fairly extreme and very, very Trumpy.
*  And so I don't think that serves him well in a general.
*  And then I think the other problem is for DeSantis, if he's the nominee, I don't
*  think that if Trump loses the primary, that he just, you know, endorses DeSantis
*  and rides off into the sunset and says, good luck, I think he tries to burn down
*  the party on the way out.
*  And so DeSantis would have to deal with that.
*  And I think back to those, talking about those non-college educated voters, I
*  think some of those voters, a good portion of those voters, they turn out
*  for Donald Trump and no one else.
*  They didn't turn out in the midterms.
*  They haven't turned out for other candidates.
*  They are Trump voters.
*  That's who they like.
*  And if Trump is not on the ticket, maybe you don't get quite that level of
*  turnout on the Republican side.
*  So I think those are problems for DeSantis.
*  But then how do you take the Florida results in 2022?
*  I think we had a weak candidate on the Democratic side.
*  I also think that the way-
*  Democrats, or people don't know, sort of re-ran Charlie Christ, who had already-
*  Re-ran Charlie Christ.
*  Lost.
*  Yeah.
*  I also think that the way DeSantis governed, he did a lot of the culture war
*  stuff for the national media, for the right-wing media.
*  That's how we got to know him.
*  When he first started as governor, he passed enough policies and did enough
*  things that made him seem, if not moderate, at least like a traditional
*  Republican, stuff around the economy.
*  I think he like proposed teacher pay increases, right?
*  Like he did enough things as governor that I think within Florida, which also
*  has gotten redder over time as well, and where the Democratic party has just sort
*  of fallen apart over the last couple of years, he did enough to make sure that
*  voters were not perceiving him as extreme as I think the national electorate
*  perceives him today.
*  So this is obviously now getting to less likely, but I don't think
*  impossible territory at all, right?
*  You can imagine a world where Republicans are getting nervous that neither Trump
*  nor DeSantis, after mauling each other across debates and rallies and whatever
*  else, are the right candidate.
*  And in 2020, Democrats ultimately acted very strategically.
*  Like they looked at the situation, they decided Joe Biden, who they didn't all
*  like the most, was going to be the best candidate to be Trump, and they went with
*  Joe Biden.
*  And there are candidates in the Republican party who are more strategically positioned,
*  I think, to take advantage of where the country is and kind of what Biden's
*  weaknesses are, a Tim Scott, a Nikki Haley.
*  So in the more off chance, but you know, you can imagine something, one of them
*  wins Iowa and all of a sudden things begin to balloon on the more off chance
*  that one of these more long shot candidates wins.
*  How do you think about that?
*  I have, I've gone over this many times in my mind because I don't want to, I don't
*  want to make such a bold prediction since I haven't been good at that in the
*  past, but I find it extremely unlikely that one of these candidates who is not
*  Ron DeSantis or Donald Trump is going to be able to pull through.
*  And here's why.
*  They all seem to me like they would be decent candidates in a Republican
*  primary that was taking place in 2008 or 2012.
*  And they all like Tim Scott, Nikki Haley, you know, Nikki Haley was at her town
*  hall the other day and she's like hitting DeSantis and Trump on not being honest
*  on entitlement reform and is it going to hurt?
*  Is it going to cause some pain?
*  Yes, it's going to cause some pain.
*  And then by the way, now I'm going to start talking about what a hawk I am on Russia.
*  And like, that's fine, but that's a Republican party that just doesn't exist
*  anymore, at least in terms of the electorate and the Republican electorate
*  now is a very MAGA like electorate and they have embraced populism, cultural
*  populism to an extent, economic populism, cutting social security and Medicare.
*  Extremely unpopular with the general electorate, also very unpopular with
*  Republican voters right now.
*  And so I just don't know that I can't think of the candidate running who could be
*  ready to step into the role of a MAGA king or queen if Trump or DeSantis falters.
*  Because to me, it seems like Nikki Haley is doing a poor MAGA impression.
*  Tim Scott isn't even trying because he's trying to run as like a kinder gentler
*  Republican, which there's been no evidence that Republican voters want that kind of
*  Republican. Mike Pence has the highest unfavorable ratings of any candidate
*  running in the Republican party because he decided not to commit treason on
*  January 6th.
*  I mean, and then like then you have someone like Chris Christie, right, who is
*  just going to go right at Donald Trump.
*  And he's going to take it to Donald Trump and make an argument that I think we
*  would all find quite compelling.
*  And recent poll shows 60% of Republican voters won't even consider supporting
*  Chris Christie for president.
*  And that's before he started taking on Donald Trump as strong as he has been
*  since he announced.
*  So I think that's basically right.
*  But I do think it's interesting and it gets a bit to this lack of fear somehow
*  Republicans have toward Biden or maybe just what the Republican Party is that
*  nobody thinks the Republican Party is going to act strategically here.
*  Yeah. I mean, look, I know people who voted for Joe Biden and don't like Joe
*  Biden, right?
*  He was not their second choice, not their third, not their fourth, not their fifth,
*  if they were actually getting down to it.
*  Right. That's true for a lot of very young liberal voters and Democrats, like they
*  really sat there thinking, God, we got to get this back and came to Joe Biden as
*  the answer to that problem.
*  It's just remarkable to me how that conversation just does not exist on the
*  right. And nobody thinks it is going to exist on the right.
*  They're going to do the thing they feel like doing, right?
*  Like they like Trump or they like the Santas and hope for the best.
*  It's just a genuine difference between the parties right now.
*  Yeah. And I let myself believe that at the outset of this Republican primary is
*  that Republican voters have to care about electability.
*  They have to now because they, you know, even if they think that Donald Trump won
*  the last election, they're still pissed that they don't have a Republican in power.
*  So they've got to focus on electability.
*  But there is a segment of that party that is still thinking a lot about electability
*  and being strategic. But it's like the Republican consultants and strategists and
*  Republicans living in blue areas in the coast.
*  And, you know, in this small segment of college educated Republicans in that party,
*  which is again, a minority of the party.
*  And I think the vast majority of Republican voters, they're not making that
*  strategic decision. And they're looking around to say like, look, I like Trump and
*  I don't think everything he says is great.
*  I don't think his tweets are good.
*  I think it might be if they think his character is bad.
*  But like, I don't know.
*  I don't know if I trust this DeSantis guy.
*  He seems kind of weird.
*  Or I like DeSantis plenty, but let's give Trump four more years and then we'll give
*  DeSantis eight years after that.
*  You know, there's that thought as well.
*  And then I think when they look at everyone else, they're just like, yeah, those people
*  remind me of Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell or the Rinos, right?
*  Like Trump has done such an effective job at marginalizing so many of the Republican
*  politicians serving today as the Rhino establishment that I really do think it has
*  trickled down to most of the Republican base.
*  And that has poisoned a lot of these candidates for them.
*  So one thing that Trump, DeSantis, anyone will have is that they all will go through
*  this primary and be out there campaigning and out there doing speeches and out there
*  doing debates. And presidents can get out of practice on this.
*  Very famously, Barack Obama did not perform terribly well in his first debate with
*  Mitt Romney and widely I think that's considered because he was just out of practice
*  for that kind of campaigning and that kind of debate stage.
*  I think this is more of a fear with Biden, given some of the age issues that they don't
*  want to activate in the voters minds.
*  So what do they have Biden do?
*  I mean, I don't get the sense he's going to be out there campaigning super hard in the
*  Democratic primary against Marian Williamson and Robert F.
*  Kennedy, Jr.
*  So what do they do to have him be prepared here?
*  I think he's got to be out there quite a bit, actually.
*  Like, I don't know that a sort of Rose Garden strategy, and I'm not saying this is what
*  they want to do, but I don't know that a Rose Garden strategy necessarily works because
*  that vacuum gets filled with everything that Republican candidates are saying every single
*  day on the trail and they're getting media attention for it and they're saying it at
*  debates all the time.
*  So, like, I think they've got to get him out there in front of bigger crowds with some
*  energy. I think they've got to give him a stump speech that shows some fight.
*  I think they've got to use humor to defuse the age question and also just sort of, you
*  know, when we were in the White House and he was Uncle Joe, like, sometimes people rolled
*  their eyes and again, he committed gaffes, but like people liked him, you know, and it
*  showed him having fun.
*  And I think they need to have a little fun, too, especially, you know, I've heard you
*  talk about this, like they need a theory of attention here and how you're going to
*  break through when you are the incumbent president, you're in the White House, you're
*  governing, and then there is a complete circus on the other side in the Republican
*  primary. And I think getting him out there in town halls, meeting people one on one,
*  showing how great he is with voters when he meets them and how compassionate he is, like,
*  I think all of that is going to be really important.
*  And I would worry about, again, feeling like getting him out there too much is taking a
*  risk and it's not worth it. And so we should just sort of, you know, keep his schedule
*  light. And again, I don't think they're going to do that, but I would get him out there
*  more because I would be worried about Republicans filling the vacuum.
*  The other thing is Joe Biden is actually president and he doesn't have a Democratic
*  Congress anymore, but he does have that office and the ability.
*  I mean, there's a reason incumbents tend to get reelected and it's not just fundraising,
*  it's that they can actually do things and the things they do can shape the stories they
*  can tell and what they can bring to voters.
*  So what should they actually substantively do?
*  I mean, they have the problem of, you know, legislation has to go through McCarthy.
*  But if you were in there, what would you be trying to achieve?
*  I mean, I think it's tough for this next year, right?
*  Like, they've almost exhausted every executive action that I think they think is
*  possible, legally possible already.
*  I don't think there's any chance for additional legislation at this point.
*  And so what does that leave them?
*  Well, all the legislation they've passed, whether it's the Inflation Reduction Act or
*  the CHIPS Act or the infrastructure bill.
*  Sure, there are plenty of projects that are starting that he can go to ribbon cuttings
*  and all that. And I think that they will have been doing that and they'll continue to do
*  that. But I would look for again, back to like how you handle the accomplishments.
*  Even when I'm at an event celebrating some shovel ready project or some grant or, you
*  know, a climate investment in the Inflation Reduction Act, I would be pushing the message
*  forward so that you're the context is a fight that you're waging and send me back and
*  I'll finish this fight. I would also like look at the Republican House and every time
*  they have a message vote or a show vote or try to do something unpopular, I go out there
*  and whack the shit out of them.
*  And just you've got to get people in the mindset over the next year that this is a
*  choice, that there are two visions, there are two paths.
*  And if you do not return me to office, these people will take over and they will do all
*  of these things that seem horrific right now and will materially harm your life.
*  And they will do that the second they get into power.
*  And I think his most important job is to like remind people of that every single day
*  between now and the election.
*  And then always final question.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  Oh, three books.
*  Well, on another podcast I do that you've been on called Offline, we have been doing a
*  challenge where we are trying to help our screen time reduce our screen addiction.
*  And so I just finished Catherine Price's How to Break Up with Your Phone, which has
*  been fantastic and very helpful.
*  What else am I reading?
*  I'm embarrassed because as you were saying that, I actually glanced at my phone.
*  I want to admit this in full view of the audience and God.
*  I'm telling you, all of those kinds of books now I'm reading, all the offline.
*  It was barely conscious too, it just sort of happened.
*  It is.
*  As I'm breaking up with my phone, I've like reacquainted myself with my Kindle because
*  I famously do not read that much because I'm on Twitter all the time.
*  And I'm finally reading A Visit from the Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan, which is
*  fantastic and also I'm reading Patricia Lockwood, No One is Talking About This,
*  which is a fantastic little weird book about the internet, of course.
*  Jon Favreau, thank you very much.
*  Thanks, Ezra.
