# Best Of: A Revelatory Tour of Martin Luther King Jr.â€™s Forgotten Teachings
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [July 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9_tb_zQOa8)
*  Before we begin today, we are doing another Ask Me Anything.
*  This will be our last one before I go on book leave for a bit.
*  So if you've got anything you want to hear me answer, send your question with the headline
*  AMA to Ezra Klein Show at NYTimes.com.
*  Again Ezra Klein Show at NYTimes.com.
*  But to today's show, it's the 4th of July.
*  We have a day off this week, so we're doing a re-air and it's pretty clear to me which
*  re-air to do.
*  I think it's become more commonly understood that there have been many foundings to America.
*  There's one we think about when we talk about July 4th, but it is by no means the only one.
*  And just as there are many foundings, there have been many founding fathers.
*  And Martin Luther King Jr. should centrally be understood as a founding father, certainly
*  of the country we intended to be, certainly maybe of the country we still hope to be.
*  And so I want to revisit my conversation with Brandon Terry about the political philosophy
*  of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
*  We recorded this back in January.
*  It is one of my favorite episodes of the show and I hope you get as much out of it as I
*  did.
*  I'm Ezra Klein.
*  This is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  There is this paradox in how we treat Martin Luther King Jr.
*  Almost everyone in America reveres him.
*  Left and right, there are holidays named after him, there are statues of him, streets named
*  after him, and almost no one really reads him.
*  Man wrote many books, wrote many essays.
*  Most of them are forgotten, few of them are taught.
*  And maybe that's not strange at all.
*  Maybe it's not an accident at all.
*  Everything is so convenient as a myth, as a uniting figure, and he is so challenging
*  even today as a philosopher.
*  That is one of the things he was.
*  He was a philosopher.
*  In recent years, there's been a counter narrative about King trying to push back on this.
*  And it admits part of what we leave out.
*  It emphasizes the positions he held that are still very far from the American mainstream.
*  His critique of American militarism, his advocacy of a universal basic income.
*  This argument, it wants to win this King, and I think it's mostly correct in this,
*  as a man of the left.
*  But King's thought is challenging if you're on the left too.
*  He's focused in ways very few are today and in ways many are very uncomfortable with today
*  on how political action changes the person taking the action.
*  He is not all about systemic solution.
*  He is also about individual change.
*  He is focused on questions of virtue.
*  He's relentless in interrogating what actually counts as victory when we engage in political
*  action with and against each other.
*  And he believes that when we are engaging in political action with and against each
*  other, we should be trying to find victory, at least victories he defines it.
*  Brandon Terry is a professor at Harvard University, and he's a co-editor of To Shape a New World,
*  essays on the political philosophy of Martin Luther King Jr.
*  I loved this book.
*  One of Terry's projects is to force a confrontation with what King actually said and believed,
*  rather than what he's come to represent.
*  And that confrontation, it is so worth having.
*  He is so challenging and worth reading and worth struggling with today.
*  What he writes is so relevant today.
*  This is one of those podcasts I'm going to be thinking about for a very, very long time
*  to come.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at ny times.com.
*  Brandon Terry, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you so much, Ezra.
*  It's an honor to be here.
*  You have this lovely line at the beginning of the book, where you say that we treat Martin
*  Luther King Jr. with this, quote, dual phenomena of ritual celebration and intellectual marginalization.
*  What do you mean by that?
*  Well, there's this puzzle when we think about somebody like Martin Luther King Jr.
*  And it's that on the one hand, we have a national holiday devoted to him, an imposing
*  monument on the hallowed space of the National Mall.
*  He's invoked in all manner of political speeches from across the political spectrum, probably
*  the most famous African-American of the 20th century.
*  But at the same time, if you ask even really well-educated people, they often don't know
*  that he'd written five major books, that he's a systematic theologian with sustained
*  interest in political philosophy, who's written lots and lots of things, incisive things
*  on some of the most pressing political and ethical matters.
*  And the question is, how can those two things stand in connection?
*  And what it occurred to me is that it's partly related to how we tell the story of the civil
*  rights movement and particularly how we tell King's role in the civil rights movement.
*  So I've described it as a kind of romantic narrative, one that's about unities in the
*  process of becoming a kind of calling together of Americans to transcend racial division
*  and come together in a kind of unifying way, a more perfect union as a kind of transcendence
*  of essential American goodness over transitory American evils.
*  And when we tell the story that way, unfortunately, not only is it mythic, but it trains us to
*  treat King as the kind of person who's not doing any original political thinking.
*  What he's doing is calling us to be true to who we always already were.
*  And when you treat him like that, the thing that becomes most interesting about him is
*  not his thought.
*  It's not the way he challenged us to think about violence.
*  It's not the way he challenges us to think about segregation, both de facto and de jure.
*  It's not how he challenges us to think about economic justice.
*  The thing that's interesting about him starts to be his rhetoric or his tactics, the way
*  in which he pushes people or frames arguments to call us to be true to who we always already
*  were.
*  That's a real problem because it evades the most incisive, challenging, and generative
*  contributions that his public philosophy makes for our era.
*  So we take King and the civil rights movement as a validation of America, not as a critique
*  or even a conversation about it.
*  I think that's right, that it gets conscripted into a story that's ultimately affirming about
*  of our constitutional order, the trajectory of our institutions, the essential goodness
*  of our national character.
*  You often hear politicians use this rhetoric of, this is not who we are.
*  And King wants to say something different, I think.
*  He wants to say that we are both of these things.
*  We're a society with what he called the congenital deformity of racism, that it's shot through
*  many of our deepest institutions and structural arrangements.
*  And because it has not been redressed on the scale that it would have to be to achieve
*  true justice, it festers.
*  It's a rot.
*  It's a challenge that every generation is called on to pick up and try to do better
*  than their forebears.
*  Do you think the legacy or the popular understanding of nonviolence is actually part of this problem?
*  And by that I mean that the way I was taught about it, the way I think it's taught, nonviolence
*  becomes not so much a philosophy, but a kind of almost inhuman forbearance and discipline.
*  That to the extent you think about it, it is in terms of what people like King and many
*  others of course were able to endure.
*  And it almost becomes a physical feat, as opposed to a philosophical one.
*  I think that's right.
*  There's a way in which the philosophy of nonviolence gets painted, even in King's time, as a kind
*  of extreme purist pacifism.
*  And part of that is the connection with Gandhi, although I think it's a radical misunderstanding
*  of Gandhi as well.
*  But it's a way of imagining the commitment to nonviolence as related to passivity, as
*  related to the performance of suffering for pity.
*  These are things that King never endorsed.
*  For him, the idea of passive resistance was a misnomer.
*  He helped coin the phrase direct action, he and other members of the civil rights generation,
*  that nonviolence is aggressive.
*  It's an aggressive attack on injustice, an aggressive form of non-cooperation with domination.
*  It's about trying to wedge yourself into the machinery of domination to prevent its adequate
*  functioning, to try to force or coerce your fellow citizens to stop and take stock of
*  what kind of injustices are being unfurled in their name.
*  It does so on the presumption that politics involves coercion, especially for King, who
*  had a pretty tragic sense of human nature, that politics is going to involve confrontation
*  with great evil, that it's not a Pollyannish view about what we're all capable of if we
*  just turn our eye toward God in the right way.
*  We're always going to live with evil, and we always are going to be called to confront
*  it.
*  We need to do it in ways that won't unleash a further chain of social evil and bitterness
*  and revenge and retaliation.
*  And King thought nonviolence was the only weapon that could cut and heal at the same
*  time.
*  I think one way to split apart these views of nonviolence is something that helped me
*  do it when I spent a while studying it a few years back.
*  I really recommend spending some time in nonviolent philosophy because I don't think there's almost
*  anything I've ever read that is as challenging to the way I think about the world.
*  But Gandhi has this line where he says that if you can't practice nonviolence, that,
*  quote, retaliation or resistance unto death is the second best, though a long way off
*  from the first.
*  Cowardice is impotence worse than violence.
*  So this idea that if you can't be nonviolent, it's better to be violent than to be a coward
*  doing nothing, I think gets at something important.
*  Can you help unpack that?
*  Sure.
*  One way to bring it back to King is that early in his career, he was engaged in a debate
*  with a man named Robert Williams, who wrote a book that was very popular amongst the Black
*  Power generation called Negroes with Guns.
*  And he gets the title.
*  The title is a slight adjustment of a slur that was said to him when he showed up at
*  a pool, a public pool with a group of armed Black men as support for an integrationist
*  demonstration.
*  And anyway, King is involved in this debate with Robert Williams in part about the legitimacy
*  of self-defense.
*  And King in his response sort of expresses confusion because he says, look, in your home,
*  in your private personhood, self-defense is perfectly justified.
*  No one disagrees with that.
*  He thinks it doesn't even really need an elaborate moral justification.
*  It's something that's basically assumed in all of the major moral philosophies that he's
*  aware of.
*  He says that the really interesting question, however, is how to organize a sustained successful
*  challenge to structural injustice.
*  And for King, that requires something that blends militant resistance and a higher order
*  ethical practice that can point the way toward peaceful reconciliation over the long term.
*  So when you hear King talk about love, when you hear King talk about nonviolence, these
*  things actually require not just a enormous discipline around the acceptance of suffering
*  as if it's some kind of passive practice, but they require really creative, dedicated
*  thinking around how exactly to push and prod your neighbors into addressing the forms of
*  structure the polity and how to do it in a way that doesn't leave a kind of perpetual
*  midnight of bitterness when the conflict is done.
*  I want to pull apart two things in that answer that sometimes get put together, which is
*  the idea of strategic nonviolence and the idea of principle nonviolence.
*  Can you talk about them?
*  Sure.
*  Partly as a response to their discomfort with Christian theology, their enthusiasm for anti-colonial
*  revolution, and a broader skepticism about the influence of some pacifist elements within
*  the civil rights movement.
*  I think there were many in the student sit-in movement and the student nonviolent movement
*  that tried to introduce this distinction between philosophical and strategic nonviolence.
*  And so for someone like Stokely Carmichael, he would often say that he supported nonviolence
*  only insofar as it works.
*  And on that model, you have a positive goal.
*  And then there's just a question, which is interpretive, empirical, about whether nonviolent
*  practice or violent practice is going to get you to that end.
*  You take whatever means are necessary to get to that end.
*  They try to introduce that distinction as opposed to nonviolence as what they would
*  say is a way of life.
*  But King, I think, really importantly challenges the legitimacy of that distinction because
*  there's a way in which the strategy question is already shot through with ethical reflection,
*  with philosophical commitments.
*  And so to raise the question of strategy as if we can evaluate means without some kind
*  of ethical reflection or without some kind of underlying ethical commitments for King
*  is already a confusion.
*  He thinks that the ends are prefigured in any means.
*  Gandhi and hence, Swaraj has this great passage where he talks about how you could come to
*  acquire a piece of property.
*  You could buy it.
*  You could steal it.
*  You could kill somebody in pursuit of it.
*  You could ask for it as a gift.
*  At the end of the day, you still have the same property, but it's the thing itself has
*  changed in one scenario.
*  It's a piece of stolen property.
*  It's a theft.
*  And another, it's a gift, which is different than something you've purchased.
*  So in the course of acquiring the thing, even though the thing is the same, the means have
*  transformed it in a really, really important way.
*  And King wants to say something similar, that in all political practice, the ends are prefigured
*  in the means and nonviolence has to be, if it's going to be true nonviolence for King,
*  informed by a philosophy of love that really wants and desires and wills goodwill for the
*  enemy at present and is committed at the fundamental level to going on together in peace, going
*  on together, sharing the polity in perpetuity.
*  So this is a tricky thought to get into a question, but let me try because it's something
*  my producer, Emma, fun.
*  I've been talking about a lot preparing for this episode.
*  When you think about somebody's political philosophy or their theory of political action,
*  you can maybe think of there being a couple agents they're thinking about.
*  So there's the person or group you're in conversation or conflict with, right?
*  You know, I'm a liberal and I'm arguing with a conservative.
*  And I think that's the most common target to think about.
*  How do I beat or convince this person or group on the other side?
*  Then there's the broader community polity, right?
*  The voters, the country, people who are bystanders, maybe interested, maybe not, but a broader
*  community that is in some way watching or can be brought in to watch.
*  And then there's you, the person taking the action and how it affects you and your group
*  to take a particular action.
*  And something that it seems present in King's thought is much, much, much, much more concern
*  and focus than I think most political thinkers have today on how political action affects
*  you, the person taking it, and affects the broader community that might be watching it.
*  Does that first track is right to you?
*  And if so, can you talk a bit about that?
*  That does track.
*  And I think for King, imperative to nonviolent resistance turns in large part on the question
*  of your own dignity and self-respect.
*  So it is a justice question.
*  He's concerned with structural justice as a matter of the kinds of arrangements that
*  prevail in the larger American society.
*  That's obviously true.
*  And he's also concerned with how you relate to your own sense of equality, equal standing,
*  worth, as he would say, somebodyness.
*  We might say dignity.
*  He also says that a lot.
*  And that for King to acquiesce in the face of oppression and domination without protest
*  is to abdicate your own self-respect and dignity.
*  When he gives the speech at the Montgomery Bus Boycott's first open meeting, he's scrambling
*  to try to put it together.
*  And the task he sets himself is he says right up front, I need to say something that will
*  cause people to see that their dignity is at stake in what we do next and which will
*  commit us to nonviolence because for him, dignity also required a certain kind of excellence
*  of character, a certain kind of comportment and practice toward others.
*  So it is about trying to defend your dignity, defend your self-respect against insult, humiliation,
*  oppression.
*  But it's also about doing so in a way that doesn't degrade your character in the long
*  term, that doesn't cause you to end up being turned away from the good, which again for
*  him is going to be a religiously inflected category.
*  But I think there are secular renderings of it that ends up with you being turned away
*  from the good and toward things like hatred, resentment, violence, which he thinks ultimately
*  will corrode your soul and take you further away from flourishing.
*  Something in that feels very present to me in a lot of the debates we've had in the
*  last couple of years around civility politics, around virtue signaling.
*  And it seems to me that there's some important distinction between the idea that you don't
*  want to be taken away from the good yourself and you are frightened or worried or focused
*  on how others will perceive you as acting.
*  Sometimes this gets called respectability politics, so that is a broader term.
*  But there's something there where I think it has fallen out of favor.
*  It gets called tone policing sometimes.
*  It has fallen out of favor to say that there are certain ways of acting politically that
*  are better and worse from a virtue perspective, because it often is seen not as really a question
*  of you and your relationship to some baseline or ideal, but as some kind of concession you're
*  making to people who don't deserve the concession.
*  Well, to answer that, I think we have to go back to where the term politics respectability
*  comes from.
*  I just think it's very useful to help people understand what might otherwise seem like
*  an idiosyncratic response.
*  So my colleague, Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham wrote a phenomenal book many years ago called
*  Righteous Discontent, and that's what introduces the phrase, the politics of respectability.
*  It's a study of turn of the century black Baptist women and their organizing efforts
*  through the church.
*  And she meant the term to kind of capture two things.
*  One is the thing that's been picked up and is now called respectability politics, and
*  folks like Ta-Nehisi Coates have been extremely critical of it.
*  It's this idea that in confronting a system of social stigma, the response that you need
*  to have to it is to try to adjust your behavior, comportment, your self-fashioning in line
*  with the dominant norms so that you can over time undermine the stigma and become a full
*  participant in society.
*  And there are all sorts of questions, legitimate questions that are raised against that.
*  Are we losing something valuable about alternative forms of life, about alternative cultural
*  practices, when we take the existing dominant norms as unassailable or something to aspire
*  to? Are we losing something in our self-respect and dignity when we don't protest that imposition
*  as unjust and instead just acquiesce or accommodate ourselves to it?
*  Are we harming people in our communities that for valuable reasons can't adjust themselves
*  or important reasons can't adjust themselves to those norms?
*  I think all of those are legitimate questions.
*  And if you read King's Trumpet of Conscience, his Canadian broadcast lectures from the last
*  year of his life, what's really fascinating is that he talks a lot about how he sympathizes
*  with all those criticisms. He agrees with them.
*  He supports the counterculture movement in lots of ways.
*  He celebrates the Black radical students who have cast off the kinds of clothing that their
*  forebears once wore as a sign of respectability in favor of genes and overalls.
*  But, and here's the other part of Evelyn Higginbotham's formulation.
*  There's a deeper question, one with thousands of years of moral reflection built up into
*  it, which is about virtue ethics.
*  That there's some things that people are appealing to you about that aren't about their effect
*  in the polity, that aren't about trying to manipulate white racial attitudes.
*  They're about your own flourishing in character.
*  They're deep questions about how to live a good life, how to achieve excellence in the
*  crafting of your soul.
*  I am a person who believes those questions are still legitimate, that they can't all
*  be reduced to strategy or will to power or psychic drives.
*  I think that there's something like an ethical life that requires us to argue about it and
*  requires us to think really hard about how we discipline ourselves to achieve it.
*  And for King, many of the appeals he made in that vocabulary are really about that.
*  They're really about virtue.
*  They're really about what hatred does to your life, what anger does to your life, what violence
*  does to your life.
*  And one way we can know this is when we look at sermons like his Shattered Dreams, because
*  King's not naive.
*  He doesn't think they're going to win in his lifetime.
*  His final speech, the mountaintop speech, he doesn't think he's going to get to the
*  promised land.
*  So there is a question for him at the core of his life, which is what makes this worth
*  doing?
*  That's a virtue question.
*  It's not just a strategic or tactical one in the narrow sense.
*  The other dimension of that, though, that I think makes it sometimes hard to follow
*  King on this is that he can seem unreachable or inhuman or like a saint.
*  He talks a lot about refusing to hate people who are trying to kill you, who are trying
*  to oppress you, who have maybe killed somebody or hurt somebody or beat somebody you love.
*  I mean, it sounds nice, right?
*  I don't want to hate anybody either.
*  But I mean, I have trouble not having pretty strongly negative reactions to people who
*  send me a crappy email.
*  And so what is the applied dimension of his philosophy here rather than saying that it
*  is a violence that is done to you when somebody is able to lure you into hating them because
*  hatred is something that is cursive to your soul?
*  How do you understand King as actually having achieved or attempted to practice that lack
*  of hate?
*  So let me say two things here.
*  One, which kind of bridges the last two questions, is that he describes nonviolence, I think
*  really importantly, as also being about a nonviolence of spirit.
*  And the example that he often gives is about humiliation.
*  So that there's a way in which the desire to humiliate others, to diminish their status
*  in front of other people for your own pleasure, the desire to subject them to standards of
*  evaluation that they probably themselves don't hold or don't understand in order to enable
*  mockery.
*  There's a way in which if we're reflexive about where that desire comes from, we will
*  find that it comes from a place that's irrational, indefensible, and likely cruel.
*  And that if we were to imagine a way of life built around those feelings, those desires,
*  those practices, it would be one that would make it really hard for us to have healthy
*  social ties, stable institutions, flourishing social relationships.
*  So part of what he's up to is asking us at all times to be self-reflexive about the desires
*  and needs and fantasies that drive us in politics.
*  And part of what nonviolence is asking us to do is do these things in a spirit of humility
*  because as King would say, our reason sometimes can become subordinate to our passions.
*  It can just be a legitimizing power or a rationalizing power to the point where we lose track of
*  what we really want to achieve, the kind of character we really want to have.
*  So what nonviolence does is it builds in a check on those kinds of rationalizations,
*  those kinds of emotional drives by teaching us to avoid forms of humiliation and forms
*  of physical violence that make it hard to come back from.
*  So that's the first point.
*  The second point, and it goes more to your sense of revenge and retaliation, is again
*  forcing us to acknowledge the legitimacy of anger.
*  I don't think King's against the idea.
*  He uses the phrase legitimate anger in the late 60s.
*  But to be reflexive about it and understand that even in a case where someone kills a
*  loved one of yours, revenge, violence, retaliation, that doesn't bring back the loved one that
*  you've lost.
*  It doesn't rebuild a world where people won't lose loved ones for horrible reasons.
*  The only thing that can do that is a kind of forward-looking, constructive practice
*  of politics and social ethics.
*  And so what he's trying to do is raise the question of can we channel our legitimate
*  rage, our legitimate anger into a practice that allows us to maintain our self-respect?
*  Because that's one of the things we're worried about is that people have done this thing
*  to us because they don't respect us.
*  So can we somehow regain our self-respect, our sense of somebody-ness, and move forward
*  a practice of constructive politics that helps shape a world where these evils are less frequent
*  and less likely to happen?
*  But I want to ask you there about King the Man, because this is a place where as a person
*  why I read more Buddhist meditation manuals than I read actual philosophy, because I agree
*  with all of this, right?
*  I can see it, I can tell myself it, and then my own ego sloshes over the sides of my cup.
*  My mental monologue is an endless recitation of arguments that haven't yet happened that
*  I'm defending myself against and slights from five years ago that I feel bad about.
*  And here's this man who's both making this public argument and trying to get people to
*  follow him in it and put themselves at risk over it, and is also living it himself and
*  talks about this unbelievably difficult thing, which is not to not feel righteous anger,
*  but to not feel hatred, to internally sort of reflect the world you want externally.
*  And I'm curious how he practices to that, what you know from him about how he lives
*  a day so that he doesn't feel what I think most of us would understand, not only to be
*  natural feelings here, but inevitable, like irresistible reactions to the way society
*  and individuals here are treating us.
*  So let me say three things. One is a shortcoming of King's in retrospect, which is that he
*  does falter, he does fail. And I think, you know, when we read biographies of King, when
*  you read the last parts of David Garrow's biography, when you read Cornel West's essay
*  from To Shape a New World, which talks a lot about the despair at the end of King's life,
*  if you watch HBO's great documentary King in the Wilderness, you see a person faltering
*  and failing under the pressure. He's not able, for example, to bring himself to a kind of
*  reconciliation with Malcolm X. There's too much hurt there of the things that Malcolm
*  has said about him. He's frustrated with how his allies abandoned him when he came out
*  against the Vietnam War. By the end of his life, he's drinking a lot more and he's erupting
*  sometimes in forms of disappointment at the people around him. And there is a question
*  about what would our relationship to King's memory be like if we knew more of that at
*  the time? And if he hadn't had to project at times a kind of superhuman ethos, whether
*  that was going to be permissible for him or what it would have been like for him to try
*  to open that faltering self up more for reflection, we don't know. But that is an important question.
*  The other two pieces, though, I think, are more in line with what you're asking for.
*  So one is that I think King himself thinks that the practice of nonviolent politics does
*  the kind of work that you're describing. And I think he would be worried about the fact
*  that in our time, so much of these questions about the management of emotion, the building
*  of character has become a privatized practice. He thinks that we learn a lot about how to
*  love other people by confronting them in public, by forcing ourselves into uncomfortable
*  situations where we have to endure the look of the other back and forth, where we train
*  ourselves to extend these interactions of contentious politics until they can alter
*  or change the people that we've put our bodies in close contact with on the field of politics.
*  So I think he does think that that's one way that this really does happen. And we have
*  lots of evidence from the civil rights movement, personal testimony and personal reflection,
*  where this seems to be the case. And the last thing I'll say is that in order to do that
*  work, in order to do some of the work you're describing, he also is building an alternative
*  community. So one way that I read that famous final speech, I've seen the promised land.
*  There's obviously a prophetic reading of it, but there's also one where he's describing
*  the prefiguration of the promised land in the kind of politics and social life he's
*  participated in over his career. That the promised land is seen in the union politics
*  in Memphis. It's seen in the student nonviolent coordinating committee gathering to do Mississippi
*  Freedom Summer. It's seen in the people walking for 350 plus days in Montgomery, Alabama and
*  banding together to help each other out. That is the promised land. And when you are in
*  a community that's constantly talking with each other and lifting each other up and engaging
*  in practices like song, prayer, other communal rituals, to try to affirm this alternative
*  set of ethical and political commitments against the whole rest of the culture. That's the
*  only way it can be done is that you have to have an alternative form of social life that
*  can sustain you in that work. The private practice isn't going to do it.
*  This may seem weird, but I want to thank you for the first point there. And it's something
*  true about the book you co-edited to. I find it very comforting and very helpful to hear
*  about the places where King falls short. The saintliness of him sometimes puts both his
*  practice and his thinking out of reach in a way that I don't think is useful. When you
*  look at the principles of nonviolence on Stanford's King Institute, I think a bunch of them would
*  be familiar to people. You can resist evil without resorting to violence. You seek to
*  win the friendship and understanding of the opponent, not to humiliate. But the last one
*  says that the nonviolent resistor must have, quote, a deep faith in the future, that they
*  should have a conviction that the universe is on the side of justice. How imaginable is
*  King's philosophy, is his practice, without his deep Christianity, without a belief in
*  redemption, in salvation, in the possibility of a next life?
*  Well, again, I go back to the sermon he gave, and it's collected in Strength to Love, and
*  it's called Shattered Dreams, where he confronts a problem that is all over the Black tradition,
*  which is that the struggle we're engaged in has gone on in some form or another for hundreds
*  of years. At the moments of its greatest promise, you can look over the course of history and
*  see just years later, we find ourselves in situations that are unimaginably awful. And
*  King is not naive. He's a student of history. He's somebody who asks himself hard questions
*  like this. And he gives two different kinds of answers. And one is the answer that you've
*  mentioned here, which is a theological answer. It's a kind of conventional theodicy story
*  that look, at the end of the day, God is at work in the world, and God is on the side
*  of justice. And we may not know exactly how the arc of the moral universe is going to
*  bend, and we won't be there when it reaches justice, perhaps, but that is a thing we can
*  have faith in. That cosmic story is going to play out the way we want. There's another
*  way that he goes at it, however. And for me, I read it as rooted in a different kind of
*  project, one that combines what used to be called philosophical anthropology, which
*  is just a way of saying philosophical reflections on what kind of beings we are. It's rooted
*  in that, and it's rooted in politics. And I think those things can find lots of overlapping
*  consensus from people outside of the Christian tradition. What you have to be committed to
*  in the last instance is that evil is not the totality of who we are as persons. We are
*  that people have the capacity, emotionally and rationally, to reflect on their life
*  plans, their practices, their commitments, and change them. Maybe not all of them, maybe
*  not all at once, but that those things can be changed. And that politics is really a
*  field where contingency is the key word. That although there are structural constraints
*  and everything can't be done at every moment, that the unprecedented, the new, the unexpected
*  happens in this realm. And the only way that we can confirm that nothing new will happen,
*  that oppression will last forever, that the future bears no hope, is if we don't act.
*  That's the only way we can confirm that it's true for all time, is by failing to act in
*  pursuit of justice. And that's King's view, I think. And to me, that's the persuasive
*  one, that in our action, we might be able to seize some measure of justice from a country
*  that has a complicated, complex swirl of contingencies. And to move the ball forward,
*  we will inevitably fail, but to look back on that failure with maturity and try to do
*  better the next time.
*  You mentioned Ta-Nehisi Coates a couple minutes ago. And I think sometimes when I think about
*  nonviolence, about something he said to me in a conversation we did during the George
*  Floyd protests, where he said, quote, the people who are called on to be nonviolent
*  are the people with the ability to do the least amount of damage, whereas we don't
*  call upon those who have the most power and actually can do the most damage. And there
*  is this way in which King and nonviolence gets weaponized by the powerful against the
*  powerless. You need to be nonviolent. But nonviolence has no relationship to me. It's
*  not something we ask of states. It's not something that the million, not literally million, but
*  the many members of Congress who wield King on the floor ever think about how to apply
*  to the laws coming out of their chamber. How do you think about that? How do you think
*  about the question of the weaponization of nonviolence and then the applicability of
*  its principles to the powerful and to what they might, we might, the state might learn
*  from it?
*  I take my inspiration on this question from King's agonizing over what he should say about
*  the Vietnam War. And just a heart wrenching decision because on the one hand you have
*  in Lyndon Johnson, the president who's done the most to advance the cause of civil rights,
*  who's speaking forthrightly about the problem of racial inequality in a way that's essentially
*  unprecedented for the American presidency. And at the same time, he's prosecuting a horrifically
*  unjust war. And there were many people, Harold Cruz famously wrote this, but others even
*  closer to King, who said, you're not the leader of Vietnam, you're the leader of the African
*  American civil rights movement. You should not speak out on this war because you'll lose
*  your relationship with Johnson. And King says that the people who are advising him this
*  way, they just don't know him, his commitment or his calling. They don't understand that
*  if he's going to raise his voice against violence in Watts or Detroit, that he's got to raise
*  it against what he called the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, his own government.
*  And I think that fits with a broader understanding of his political philosophy, which is about
*  a kind of intensive critique of the ways in which we resort to violence as a ready at
*  hand answer to all manner of social problems. So for him, the question was really one about
*  militarism and the way that violence gets imagined as this kind of hard headed, realistic,
*  hyper rational response to international disputes and social problems abroad. When in actuality,
*  if we take stock of what he called the casualties of war, the spiritual ones and the material
*  we would realize that most of the violence we engage in at the foreign policy level is
*  counterproductive. It's created more problems and more harms than it ever has seemed to
*  solve. This is one of the powerful interventions that you see in Lionel McPherson's essay in
*  To Shape a New World. It's just this idea that this is about hard headed realism is
*  mythic. King says it's about a kind of immature image that we are nurturing for ourselves,
*  that we're trying to shore up this idea of ourselves as some kind of crusading hero or
*  all powerful world power while not taking stock of all of the things about our freedoms,
*  about our way of life, about our connectedness as a society, about our social divisions that
*  war has exacerbated, not to mention that the violence that's prosecuted abroad. He says
*  similar things about domestic policy, the ways in which our politics toward poor families, single
*  parent households is punitive for reasons that aren't justified, that our response to what he
*  calls the derivative crimes of the ghetto are wildly out of proportion and unjust compared to
*  how we treat the systematic crimes of exploitation, segregation, disenfranchisement that structure
*  much of ghetto life. So I'm in total agreement with Coates on that question. I just think that
*  part of why that phenomenon that he's describing is allowed to stand is because people still to
*  this day do not know King's commitment or his calling. They don't read the work.
*  So I've spent most of my adult life covering policy and policymaking and the ends of policymaking
*  and the means of policymaking and what people are trying to achieve. And it often strikes me that
*  one of the challenges from nonviolence is about this question of what you're attempting to do
*  both to yourself, which is something I think the government never thinks about. What is the
*  application of a policy mean for what kind of government or what kind of state it becomes?
*  What does it mean for the people due to the people who carry it out?
*  And then what are you actually trying to achieve more broadly in the community?
*  And on the first level, it just seems, I don't want to call it axiomatic, but a repeated lesson
*  that the more willing you become to use violence as a state, the more it corrupts you, the more
*  violent you become as a state. And to some degree, the more violent the people you are policing,
*  the people you are occupying become. And I'm not a pacifist. I don't believe you can fully
*  eradicate violence, but we don't weigh how violent we make others in our actions very well.
*  And then how violent we become in response, how much we enter into that escalatory dynamic.
*  But then the other thing is this question of this broader community of changing hearts,
*  of changing minds, of acting upon people, not through punishment, but through our belief that
*  they can alter. And I'd be curious to reflect on that question of community a little bit, because
*  I think one of the central debates of our time is who's actually in the community, right? And a lot
*  of policy is actually about writing people outside of the community. A lot of our political fights
*  about who should be let into the conversation. What would it mean to have a bit more of King's
*  view of trying to create community at the center of what the state is attempting to do as it fashions
*  and helps govern a country? So one underappreciated feature from King's famous Riverside
*  Church speech against Vietnam is that he goes on this whole riff about America lacking maturity.
*  And it's a weird thing to have in a foreign policy speech. You're used to, you know, you're a policy
*  person, you know, you don't usually hear the word maturity banded about in these kinds of debates.
*  But what he's getting at is that something like really tightly linked to violence, that violence
*  always exceeds the original justification you have for it. It's not precise. It's not able to be
*  easily targeted as we think. It spirals out, it produces retaliation, and then we retaliate again.
*  And all the while, it's expanding its justifications to the point of absurdity. And King describes
*  that as a kind of adding cynicism to the process of death. And he says that maturity is one of the
*  only ways out here. That the maturity to be able to stand up and say we were wrong,
*  we want to make amends, we want to repair evils committed in our name.
*  Those are questions that are essentially non-starters in American politics right now.
*  Certainly about foreign policy, but even in some places in domestic policy. You're starting to get
*  some of this in the attempted wind down of mass incarceration, but this isn't something that you
*  would hear, for example, in welfare reform debates or something like that. King calling us to
*  maturity and that being really crucial to the politics of non-violence. Again, being about
*  self-reflective activity and about trying to take ownership of the things that you've done wrong,
*  that the goal to do no harm is something that we've fallen short of. That feature of King's
*  thinking is something that I always want to draw attention to because I think it's something we
*  ignore. So that's the first point I want to make. The second thing, and this is also really deeply
*  seeded in that Vietnam speech, one of the reasons that people hated it so much, he was attacked in
*  the New York Times, basically every editorial page in the country. One of the reasons people
*  hated that speech so much is that he spent so much time expressing solidarity and sympathy with
*  Ho Chi Minh and the North Vietnamese forces. We're engaged in war with these people. How could you
*  express sympathy or some kind of solidarity with the enemy? And it's very instructive how King went
*  about it. He wasn't one of these people, I mean, you've seen these images of people waving the
*  North Vietnamese flag at counterculture protest. It wasn't like that. It was him really spending
*  a lot of time meditating on the reasons why we ended up in this conflict, narrating the whole
*  history of our failure to support Ho Chi Minh and the struggle against French colonialism,
*  against Chinese colonialism, and how that had led to the situation we were in by 1967.
*  King is narrating this history. He's also trying to get people to think about what it must feel
*  like to be on the ground in Vietnam and witness these bombings, witness this imposition of terror.
*  And he's doing that because at bottom, he's inspired by a vision really rooted in the parable of the
*  good Samaritan from the Bible that everyone is our neighbor, that there are no sectional loyalties
*  that should eviscerate our moral obligations to others, our obligation to show them respect,
*  to go on and community with them. And that most of what goes on in foreign policy and particularly
*  war making is a bad faith evasion of the fact that we're all interconnected. And King didn't even have
*  the luxury of speaking about climate change the way we do, the ways in which the COVID pandemic
*  has exposed some of the deep ways we're connected. But he understood that there's a fundamental
*  interconnectedness amongst humanity at the ethical level and at the material structural level,
*  and that war making is an evasion of that fact. We're going to have to live together. So the
*  chief question that should organize it is how can we do so in peace?
*  We've been talking about King's nonviolence. I want to talk about his economic thought,
*  but I want to do it from this perspective of his continued attention to what different politics
*  and practices and policies and conditions do to people's souls. He's a line where he says,
*  the dignity of the individual will flourish when the decisions concerning his life are in his own
*  hands, when he is the assurance that his income is stable and certain, and when he knows that he
*  has a means to seek self-improvement. Personal conflicts between husband, wife, and children
*  will diminish when the unjust measurement of human worth on a scale of dollars is eliminated.
*  Tell me a bit about the spiritual and psychological dimensions of King's economic philosophy and
*  organizing. Well, for King, the question of poverty and the question of economic inequality
*  are both questions of dignity and democracy. The question is of dignity because
*  when you live without the adequate means to really enjoy the fair value of your basic rights,
*  when you live in a society, and this is a really important point for King, when you live in a
*  society of profound affluence like the United States and you live in severe poverty, it expresses
*  a kind of contempt from your fellow citizens about your standing as an equal member of the polity.
*  So separate from the plain material fact of hunger or health care, there's this additional
*  spiritual concern with the way in which living with nothing, living on a lonely island amidst
*  an ocean of prosperity, as he would put it, diminishes your dignity. It makes it hard for
*  you to remain tethered to the fact that you are somebody, that you matter in the world, that your
*  rights are inviolable, that you have the same kind of equal worth as other people. So that's
*  that piece of it. And then another piece, so this is kind of the bridging of the dignity and democracy
*  question, is that when people don't have a say in the core vital interest of their life, when they
*  have no decision-making power over the processes which determine how their life is going to go,
*  that too is a diminishment of their dignity. And King, who's operating in a long tradition
*  of social democracy, wants to expand democratic practices to the broader economic realm. So he
*  has this really curious passage, but I think it fits with this political philosophy. And where do
*  we go from here? He talks about how tenants unions and welfare rights unions are these
*  extraordinary inventions in the history of democracy. Why democracy? Well, because they're
*  making something like the administration of government benefits, the housing market,
*  and fair housing opportunities, subject to the deliberative input and democratic contestation
*  of the people who enjoy them, the people who are subject to them. Without expanding democracy
*  into that economic realm for King, we're both making a mockery of democracy, and we're diminishing
*  the dignity of citizens who live in search of a real standing as free and equal.
*  This seems like a very lost way of thinking to me. And I don't want to say nobody today is doing it,
*  that would be wrong. But as somebody who spends a lot of my time in debates about economic policy,
*  I think it is fair to say that the ends of economics are taken as the economy, typically.
*  You know, people hopefully shouldn't starve. But a lot of debates about what we should do,
*  even for the poor, become this sort of recursive, well, how can they better participate in the
*  economy? And how are they going to be able to invest in themselves? And how will there be
*  opportunity, economic opportunity for their children? And the idea that the economy is
*  subservient to the community, that the point of the economy is the community that should be
*  measured or policy should be measured by what they do for democratic participation, for the
*  dignity of individuals is pretty lost. I mean, if anything, I see it more now on like the post
*  liberal right, as people call it, than I even do among mainline Democrats. And it just seems to me
*  to be a very important and correct part of King's thought that is, I think if you ask people about
*  it, they would say they believe it. But it is fallen out of favor as a way to frame and think
*  about these conversations. Yeah, I mean, I think it's rooted in some really complicated things.
*  I think there's a kind of liberal anxiety about speaking forthrightly about the fact that living
*  in areas of severe concentrated disadvantage and racial segregation that we call ghettos,
*  diminishes the dignity of the people who live there. That feels uncomfortable for people to say.
*  Forthrightly in the way that King would. And so we try to get around it by speaking about opportunity
*  and the wealth gap and unemployment statistics. But really what people are feeling is an existential
*  assault on dignity. I think we also, and my colleague Elizabeth Hinton, dear friend, in her
*  first book, from the war on poverty to the war on crime, one way to read that book is to say
*  that she's telling a kind of tragic story about the loss of a particular ideal that guided great
*  society politics. And that's the principle of maximum feasible participation. That was an idea
*  that was a really social democratic idea. This idea that, well, we need to empower all sorts
*  of people to participate in policymaking and democratic deliberation. And that part of where
*  people will find self-respect and dignity is through engagement in politics and their community
*  all the way up. And that even bureaucracy should not be impervious to democratic deliberation and
*  democratic decision-making for very complicated reasons, partly about the turn to a punitive
*  impulse and social policy, fear of black radicalism, the urban rebellions, the economic crises of the
*  late 1960s and early 1970s. For those reasons, that ideal was defeated in that moment. But
*  we've lost something really profound in our mockery of it and our easy dismissal of it.
*  And I think, again, returning to King's work, where it's so front and center,
*  allows us to enrich this conversation. And I'll just say one last thing here.
*  One way you might think about it is that when Bernie Sanders came out, we got to hear the words
*  democratic socialism over and over again. But there was a lot more interest in what makes it
*  socialist than what makes it democratic. And for me, King is really interesting because
*  if he's in that tradition, the thing he's most exciting and innovative about is actually the
*  democratic part. And that's the part where even the people who operate under that label have fallen
*  short. I think that's a really, really sharp point. And I think it gets to something that
*  is very present towards the end of King's life, which is his sense that there is something
*  important for the civil rights movement in the labor movement. And unions on some level, they are
*  mechanisms of democracy. They're one of the most important functions they have is workplace
*  democracy. Can you talk a bit about both the bridges he was building, but also the connections
*  that he was drawing? Well, sure. King is in this tradition in many ways inspired by a mentor of
*  his and one of the most important figures in American history, but one of the most severely
*  neglected was A. Philip Randolph, the great labor leader, former organizer of the Pullman Porters,
*  the architect of both the March on Washington that gets canceled, which was going to target the
*  Roosevelt administration during World War II and the 1963 famous March on Washington for Jobs and
*  Freedom. He's following Randolph in lots of ways because they've got a certain set of commitments.
*  So one is the idea that because most African Americans are working class or poor, anything that
*  advances the interest of working class people and their ability to exercise democratic control over
*  the economy is going to advance the interests of African Americans. Now, in our moment, that's
*  become more complicated as the class stratification of African Americans has intensified, but in the
*  1960s, you could see why King and Randolph were so adamant and Bayard Rustin were so adamant about
*  this point. They also, though, were extremely critical of the labor movement for its history
*  of racial discrimination. If you study the history of labor unions in the 20th century,
*  late 19th century, you'll see that it's just utterly shot through with exclusions based on
*  race, kind of complicated institutionally racist practices about seniority that really
*  disadvantaged Black people, and the constant prodding and poking of the labor movement by
*  Randolph, by King, by Rustin, by Ella Baker, by folks like that, really enacted over time an
*  important set of changes in the labor movement. I've written a little bit about this with an essay,
*  A New Labor Forum with my friend and labor organizer, Jason Lee. But the last thing I'll say,
*  and I think it's probably the most interesting thing, is that for King,
*  labor unions are also, as you described, important laboratories of democracy. So they're one of the
*  few places where people from all walks of life can get together, deliberate about strategy,
*  deliberate about social ends, social goods, put money behind things that they value that aren't
*  only their own material interests. They also allow for forms of nonviolent contestation.
*  So the strike, the sit-down strike, where the sit-ins take their inspiration from, the boycott.
*  Unions in a lot of ways are one of the original laboratories for the ideas that come to be
*  associated with the civil rights movement. King knows this, acknowledges this, and thinks a lot
*  about how we can sustain union participation in an era, his era, where the threat of automation
*  was looming so largely on the horizon.
*  One of the just extraordinary tragedies of King's death is that he's only 39. I'm 38. I'm coming into
*  39 fast. I just turned 39 two weeks ago. Congratulations. And I'm still learning a lot.
*  I'm still changing a lot. And there's such an unfinishedness to him and his work. And I think
*  And there's such an unfinishedness to him and his work that I think also reverberates in how
*  he gets used today. So today, of course, there's this ongoing, always is this ongoing argument
*  of should you have race-based politics? Or is that unusable, doesn't work, creates too much backlash?
*  You should have class-based politics that are looking for commonalities. And because you've had
*  so much economic disadvantage for black Americans, that'll work through the mechanism of class just
*  fine. And there's this looking at what King is doing at the end of his life with the Poor
*  People's Campaign and deeper focus on economic justice and often the shared plight of poor white
*  and poor black Americans. And that kind of view that I think you sometimes hear, like a drawing
*  of a line forward, right? If he had been around, he would have come down on, particularly if you're
*  somebody who believes we should have a class-based politics, he would have come down on my side of
*  the debate. That's where he was going. How do you understand his thinking about those two approaches?
*  And how do you understand where he was going? So, you know, King often invokes the philosopher,
*  Hegel, because he's constantly describing his mode of thinking as a dialectical one,
*  where he's trying to reconcile seeming opposites and produce a new synthesis, which helps you
*  transcend certain intractable problems. Now, as a reading of Hegel, that has much to be desired.
*  But as a description of Martin Luther King's thought, I think that's always a good way to
*  understand what he's up to. And so I think what he's always trying to do is kind of transcend
*  that opposition. And there's a way to transcend it that I want to resist. And I think it's really
*  important to resist. So I think there's a way in which we sometimes will say class-based politics
*  works to lift African-Americans because they're disproportionately poor.
*  And what's tricky about that is that it doesn't really theorize what to do about
*  the African-American middle class and the African-American elite. So a thing that King
*  was thinking a lot about when he wrote Stride Toward Freedom and the Montgomery Bus Boycott
*  is there are areas where racial solidarity is going to be really effective.
*  And probably indispensable. So where questions of anti-black racism emerge, where questions of
*  racial humiliation, stigma that really affects the larger group, things that all black people feel
*  vulnerable to, those are going to be areas, like the segregation laws on the buses, those are going
*  to be areas where you actually can generate a lot of racial solidarity and do a lot of important
*  work with it, especially as a defensive posture. When you start to get into questions of political
*  economy, however, you have to be careful because the appeal to racial solidarity can actually
*  obscure the fact that black people don't all share the same material interests in lots of ways.
*  I'm from Maryland originally. I think this is a great laboratory to study this kind of thing.
*  When Ben Jealous ran for governor in Maryland, he was destroyed in part by being painted as a
*  socialist. And the black middle class located in the DC suburbs did not rally to his support because
*  their material interests were not aligned with a radical redistribution of wealth in the same way.
*  This is a feature of American politics that has changed dramatically from King's era. And any of
*  our kind of race or class-based politics discussions have to confront that head on. So what I think
*  King's primary principle always is, is that he's dedicated to the group that William Julius Wilson
*  called the truly disadvantaged, the least of these, that is the most vulnerable group in the
*  world. That at the end of the day, he's going to give everything to the people who are in the most
*  desperate situation, the poor, and that's going to guide his politics. So where that is enabled by
*  a race-based solidarity, so on questions of policing perhaps, or questions of social stigma
*  and media discourse, that's where he'll turn. But in other cases, I think he'd really be trying to
*  experiment with a form of politics that empowers the poor to take leadership on their own,
*  to take a part in political action and policymaking, and that really puts as its first
*  principle, the amelioration and elimination of poverty. I always want to avoid asking anyone to
*  channel a deceased thinker. I don't think it's a fair question. But we have this period we've been
*  in, where there are these huge fights over what got called wokeness and then I think anti-racism,
*  or in a different version, critical race theory. And I mean, there are better and worse faith
*  versions of those discussions. But one of the better faith ones, I think, which gets to something
*  you were just talking about, is whether there's a tendency for these conversations to get captured
*  away from a focus on material outcomes, particularly for the least well-off, and pushed towards
*  representation, particularly in elite spaces, sort of symbolic politics. This sometimes gets
*  called virtue signaling, social media activism. And I'm curious as somebody who has been deeply
*  marinated in King's thought, not what you think he would have made of it, but what he has helped
*  you make of it. How does being more aware of the distinctions he drew and the decisions he made
*  help you look at some of the past we should be walking down today and are not in these
*  conversations or are walking down and shouldn't be? So, you know, I do want to be clear,
*  and maybe in a way that wasn't exactly precise in my last answer, that the critique of racism
*  does have important work to do in the pursuit of economic justice. So, in order for us to understand
*  why so many African Americans are located in the realm of the most disadvantaged, in the strata of
*  the most disadvantaged, you have to understand the history of racial domination in this country.
*  You have to understand the persistence of racial discrimination, especially in labor markets. And
*  you have to understand the ways that racial ideology allows us to obscure the nature of
*  our economy. So, I mean, the most classic example is that structural unemployment
*  gets reframed by racism as questions of laziness or pathology or criminality instead of as a feature
*  of the economy as such. So, King always talks about the critique of racism as part of the diagnosis
*  of the disease in order to cure it. So, even in the privileging the least well-off and being
*  concerned with poor people of all races, he wants to say that the critique of racism helps us
*  see through the kinds of blindnesses that obscure the nature of our economy and the commonalities
*  across race and the things that we need to know to address the questions of economic justice
*  precisely. So, that's the first thing. The second thing is that in his critique of black power,
*  one of the things he says is that he worries that black power gives priority to the question of race
*  in a way that confuses our analysis of social reality. So, what does he mean by that? Well,
*  if you think that all black disadvantage is primarily about anti-black racism,
*  you can kind of start to miss the fact that there are broader economic dislocations that need to be
*  addressed, that there are structural features of the American constitutional order, ways in
*  which municipal boundaries are structured, ways that funding decisions are made that aren't
*  primarily driven by racial animus that need to be addressed. You can lose sight of those things
*  and start to think that the real battle is in something like a kind of totality of anti-black
*  racial ideology that can be battled in Hollywood movies and comic books and school curricula and
*  legislation and political rhetoric. So, it's not to say that those things don't exist. It's just
*  to say that there's a kind of confusion about what's going to make the biggest impact in
*  improving the life circumstances of the least well-off. And I think King really calls us to
*  constantly be very precise about what the causal mechanisms are for black disadvantage and to not
*  be confused by the fact that there's discrimination and injustice and cruelty in these other realms,
*  but which might not have as much causal impact as some of these other things.
*  The last thing I'll say, which I want to end on because I don't want to sound like I'm just
*  totally disparaging this critique of representation and these things, you know, King was very adamant
*  that black pride, that a concern with representation, that thinking in expansive ways about how do you
*  affirm the somebodiness of black youth, that those things are really, really important
*  and that they're not to be dismissed. So, it is a question of justice if, you know, people in
*  Hollywood just constantly demean or diminish the talent of non-white actors. That is a question of
*  justice. It's just that we have to be honest about what the import of those struggles will be
*  for the broader group. And the only way we can do that is by being attentive to the class differences
*  within the group. I want to ask a version of the question from the other side now, which is,
*  I heard you say something that I found interesting, which is that studying black nationalism
*  and the civil rights era had given you a lot of insight into what's going on on the right today.
*  Tell me a bit about what you mean by that. I think there are lots of ways you could take it,
*  but I'll focus on one thing that I've been thinking quite a lot about. And it goes back to part of
*  our earlier conversation on the problem of hope, futurity, problem of humiliation.
*  And there's a way in which, and King diagnoses this very incisively, there's a way in which some
*  genres of black nationalism are so pessimistic about the possibility for
*  multiracial democracy in the United States, for any kind of black flourishing in the United States,
*  that they essentially foreclose real interest in political organizing and social movements.
*  But the energy they still manage to generate, the outrage, the sentiment, the sociality,
*  they find their outlet instead in a kind of practice of humiliation, a counter-aggression
*  practice of humiliation. So that there may not be hope that we can actually change the country,
*  but at the very least, we can enjoy a feeling of retaliation, a kind of self-respecting
*  sense of resistance by engaging in a practice of trying to humiliate our opponents in the public
*  sphere, to mock them, to make bombastic claims about the conspiratorial things that they're up to.
*  And there's a titillation to that. There's a catharsis in watching someone, at that point,
*  it would have been called stick it to whitey. Now it would be stick it to the libs or own the libs.
*  So for me, I see those similar political emotions at work in a group of people who
*  I think don't have really much hope that Donald Trump is going to change America or that the
*  movement they're a part of is going to fundamentally change the structure of the world so that it could
*  bring back places that have been destroyed by globalization and offshoring and predatory capital.
*  They don't really think that any of that's going to change, but they're finding an outlet for their
*  feelings of resentment and retaliation in this performance of counter humiliation.
*  Now the danger is that unlike the Black Nationalist movement, and I want to make clear
*  that I don't mean all of the Black Nationalist movement. There are many currents that have
*  nothing to do with the kind of thing I'm describing. But unlike that movement, which is always going to
*  be small and easily repressed, this is a significant amount of people that could cause real damage in
*  the places where they don't face many countervailing forms of power. And they can exercise a much more
*  toxic impact on the broader state of American politics in a time where the media environment's
*  way more fragmented when, as you've written about quite powerfully, the country is much more
*  polarized and the polarization is in part geographically sorted. So I see those elements
*  and I think that we need more people operating in the kind of mode that King did in his critique
*  of Black power to try to turn people away from their understandable feelings of hostility
*  and resentment toward more productive forms of political engagement.
*  I think something I want to draw to that in this conversation is actually the word emotion,
*  which is a neglected part of politics, maybe of King's thought in particular, is that he understood,
*  I think he understood, part of the goal of politics and political action as creating
*  a particular structure of political emotion. And so I'm curious as we end here, how you would just
*  distill that down and then what you would say when you look at what we have today, the left and the
*  right today, our politics today, what structure of emotion, of political emotion, we're actually
*  living in. My mentor and friend, Karuna Mantana at Columbia, a brilliant political theorist working
*  on a book on Gandhi, I've learned this from her, thinking a lot about how nonviolence is a kind of
*  realism, in part because it doesn't engage in the kind of fiction that politics is operating on the
*  model of rational discussion. It takes very, very, very seriously the problem of emotion.
*  And for King, thinking about the history of racial oppression in America,
*  there are kind of key emotions that you have to think about. One of the most important ones is fear,
*  that you can go back to Thomas Jefferson, Alexis de Tocqueville, F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great
*  Gatsby, you constantly are getting expressions of a fear of Black retaliation and revenge,
*  that the moment Black people take power, the moment Black people get a foot off their necks,
*  they're going to do to us what we've done to them. If that fear is a long-standing,
*  deeply structuring feature of American culture and political life, if it's something that animates
*  our comedy movies, our stand-up routines, our political discourse, you can't operate as if it's
*  not there. You have to do things that will somehow disarm, disrupt, dispel those fears in order to
*  make progress on the political questions you want to pursue. That was one of King's deepest,
*  deepest commitments. He's thinking a lot about anger, which we've talked at great length about.
*  And one of the disappointments I've had with radical politics and the present,
*  as sympathetic as I am to most of the aims, is that I just don't think the emotion question has
*  been adequately considered. People often defend their politics as like, King was unpopular and
*  the things we're saying are unpopular, so we're operating in that tradition. Well,
*  it's not enough to just say, I've started a conversation, I've provoked something toxic
*  in the culture. He's not trying to do that necessarily. He's trying to elicit reactions
*  that bring forward certain emotions, but not let those emotions unravel the society itself.
*  He's trying to channel them into other forms of political affect that are much more congenial to
*  reconciliation and justice. So, in formal politics, in mainstream democratic politics,
*  mainstream Republican politics, what we've unfortunately ended up with is that the
*  sophistication of mobilization strategists, the depth of the polarization has made anger the
*  principal affect of American politics at this moment. And so much of what I think a King inspired
*  political philosophy, both at the state level and the activist level, has to do is think about how
*  do we transform the recalcitrant nature of today's political anger and channel it into
*  forms of constructive politics that might point toward a more just future and that might dissolve
*  the forms of anger that are illegitimate and ill-founded, in part by doing the kind of work
*  sometimes described as a moral jujitsu, turning those affects against themselves, in part, to try
*  to transform them into something different. I'm so glad I asked that question to get that answer.
*  And I want to say two things about it, which is one, that I think it's easy to say that's wise.
*  But what it is, I think, more is challenging. And maybe it'll be easier to use myself as an example
*  here. When I started out in blogging and political writing and journalism, particularly blogging,
*  I think I thought a lot about politics in terms of winning and losing, and in my corner of it,
*  winning and losing intellectually, that I was involved in political arguments,
*  and arguments could be won or lost in front of some kind of audience.
*  And two things have begun to corrode for me that sense. One is having been in a lot of arguments,
*  and I think I'm a reasonably good arguer, and so I've done by my own lights well, and then noticed
*  it didn't have at all the effect I wanted it to have, which is, if anything, it usually, if you
*  really beat somebody in an argument and they feel humiliated, they go further into views they already
*  held. They don't come to you. Like, if you really make them feel bad, then they go to the people
*  who will still make them feel good. And so you kind of lose by winning. And then the second is,
*  particularly in the Trump era, this sense that if you met something awful
*  with the equal and opposite energetic force, that in some weird way you just added energy
*  to what was now a kind of awful system in conversation. And not to say you shouldn't
*  add some energy to it, but it often, it seemed to me to sidestep this question of how do you
*  leech energy out of it? What do you do to not create a sense that this is the right conversation
*  to be having? And I don't know the answers to it, and I'm not saying I've ascended to some higher
*  plane and don't argue or any of that. Like, I have all the same intuitions and senses I've always had,
*  but that's why I find King so interesting and challenging in this way, because it's just really,
*  really, really different to ask the question, how do I reshape the emotional politics
*  and the emotional structure of myself, of the people I'm in conflict with, and then of the
*  people who are bystanders or watchers of that conflict for the better? It's just a really
*  different goal to be targeting and just unimaginably harder than can I come up with
*  an argument that I think is a winning argument. And I think you see it, you know, when he's
*  assassinated, the leading figures of the Black Power generation, they're heartbroken.
*  They mourn his loss. They grieve for him in part because, and you can read any of these memoirs,
*  particularly Stokely Carmichael's, they felt like he never, that even when he disagreed with them,
*  he loved them. And not just because they were friendly, but because he loved,
*  loved in the sense that he always invoked of agape love, that he wanted goodwill for them,
*  and that his arguments weren't from a place of trying to humiliate them or embarrass them
*  or expose them as ridiculous. He wanted to affirm their right to make the arguments they were
*  making, to affirm their intelligence and judgment, and to enter into their mind to try to
*  reconstruct a position with sympathy, but then show why it falls short for the sake of
*  goals that he was forthright about, about justice, about reconciliation, about love.
*  Those essays where he's criticizing Black Power, to me, they're like,
*  I wish my students could spend all their time with those essays and think about how to persuade,
*  how to argue. Now, I will say we are in a moment of extraordinary cynicism,
*  and cynicism can take advantage of your intellectual honesty, your practice of agape love,
*  but I think that's in the short term. In my better moments, I'm of the view that
*  the only way to start to turn the tide against the cynicism that has so corroded and corrupted
*  our political culture is to try to have these demonstrations of humility and authenticity
*  that cause us to put ourselves at some risk the way that King did. It's not clear to me how else
*  you get out of a death spiral of mutually reinforcing cynicism. I think that's a lovely
*  place to end. So always our final question. What are three books you would recommend to the audience?
*  And if I can put one spin on that. You mentioned the many books King wrote.
*  If people want to start with one thing he actually wrote to read one book,
*  which one should they start with? That's a hard one. I would probably say,
*  I think you get the best sense of his mature thought from his 1967 book, Where Do We Go From
*  Here? Chaos or Community, which is still our question. So I would definitely recommend that.
*  I also really love Trumpet of Conscience, his Canadian broadcasting corporation lectures that
*  were published posthumously. And then three books, and I'll keep it on a King theme for the holiday.
*  I really strongly recommend Peniel Joseph's The Sword and the Shield. It's a dual biography of
*  Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. I reviewed it for the New York Review of Books and think really
*  highly of it. It's a great meditation on the ways they influenced each other. And it gives you a
*  good sense of the broader intellectual milieu of the period. I also really like Jeanne Theo-Harris's
*  More Beautiful and Terrible History. I think for people coming to the study of the civil rights
*  movement for the first time or kind of curious about why some of the things that I've said don't
*  sound familiar to them, she writes in a really accessible and intelligent way about some of the
*  myths that structure how that history is taught and popularly conveyed. We have a lot of agreements
*  there. And then kind of Where Do We Go From Here question, I want to recommend my colleague Tommy
*  Shelby's book, Dark Ghettoes, which is a King-inspired philosophical reflection on
*  the deep structure of ghetto poverty and what it requires of us as a society to do to redress it.
*  It's a book that's very demanding on how far we've fallen short and questions of justice that
*  pertain to the kind of neighborhoods that we grew up in and around. And that also raises really
*  important questions about how to understand the forms of dissent that emerge out of the ghetto
*  and that may not always appear to be dissent at first glance. And it's a very charitable and
*  thoughtful and sympathetic reading, again, inspired by King's political philosophy.
