# Your Questions on Open Conventions, a Gaza Schism and Bidenâ€™s Chances
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37OFaZ76bmo)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  Last week, I did an audio essay arguing that Joe Biden right now does not seem up for the
*  campaign he is going to have to run.
*  He is behind in the polls.
*  He is skipping things like Super Bowl interviews, having trouble in press conferences, and
*  that if things don't change, this is not going to go well.
*  And that there is another option for Democrats, that Biden could step aside and Democrats
*  could do what parties have done many times before and go to a convention.
*  Then we had Elaine K. Mark on the show to talk about how convention would work.
*  And this is something I said we would also do in this little series, which is take questions
*  on it.
*  And we got a lot of them.
*  We got thousands of responses to the initial audio essay.
*  Our great senior editor, Claire Gordon, has joined me here to sort of be the audience
*  representative and make sure I'm actually answering questions.
*  So let's jump into it.
*  Where do we begin?
*  Yeah, Ezra, you threw a bit of a grenade into the world, and now it is time to take a little
*  bit of fire.
*  And our first question is from MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes.
*  I think a lot of people share this acute sense of Biden's campaigning ability, like his candidate
*  quality, to be significantly diminished, even if they think he's not diminished in the actual
*  office.
*  But my big question about all of these scenarios, and there's been many about Biden not being
*  the nominee, is it seems like there's one person who gets to decide if Joe Biden is
*  going to run for president again.
*  And that's Joe Biden.
*  And I can't imagine a scenario in which he decides that, absent some medical situation
*  that happens.
*  So I just I can't get past that first step.
*  So I'm just curious what you how you think about it.
*  Thank you, Chris.
*  So one way to say what I'm saying in that audio essay is I'm making a prediction about
*  the campaign.
*  I am saying that if you look at where Joe Biden is now, he's losing.
*  He's losing in the polls and typically Donald Trump overperforms his polling.
*  So that's a pretty dangerous place for Biden to be.
*  And he his early speeches are not looking great to me.
*  His performance in press conferences has been like, frankly, disastrous.
*  He skipped the Super Bowl interview.
*  I am not seeing a kind of energy and aggression in that campaign that makes it look to me
*  like Biden's going to be able to close the gap.
*  So that's my concern.
*  One thing that could happen is I could just be proven completely wrong.
*  Maybe Biden shakes off the campaigning cobwebs, gets out there, gives a fiery state of the
*  union, gives really strong speeches, gives more interviews, gives strong pressers, maybe
*  climbs a bit in the polls.
*  The paid media advertising campaign begins to look really good.
*  And I come to look really alarmist.
*  My audio essay looks ridiculous.
*  Joe Biden wins by five and everybody says I'm an idiot.
*  And like that would be totally fine.
*  That would be a great outcome to this.
*  But it could go the other way, too.
*  Over the next three or four months, Joe Biden could look worse.
*  He could freeze out on the campaign trail in a significant way or have some moment that
*  reads to people like really profound confusion.
*  He could be in an effort to keep that from happening, kept in even more of a bubble by
*  his staff.
*  The state of the union could go poorly or just be very low energy or something.
*  He could give interviews that go badly, could sit for some things and it just goes disastrously.
*  And he could be slipping in the polls.
*  He could be down.
*  When I look at the polling averages right now, I see him down by one to two points.
*  If he's down by three to four in May, late May, that's going to look really scary to
*  Democrats.
*  And then of course, there's the things he cannot control.
*  He could have a serious health event.
*  That's a possibility, too.
*  So if any of that happens, there's going to be more pressure from inside the party, more
*  pressure even from the people directly around him for him not to run.
*  Absolutely none of what I am saying here.
*  Forget animus for Biden.
*  I like the guy.
*  I think he's a deeply honorable person.
*  I think he has done a great job.
*  I think he's been committed to this work for his entire adult life.
*  I think highly of him.
*  And I think that if he or the people who he trusts and loves around him are looking at
*  this in May or June, and it looks like they are going to lose, I would like to believe
*  he will listen to them.
*  I think there was some chance he could come to the view himself.
*  To me, in all of this, what is important is that Democrats feel they have this other option
*  if they need it.
*  In four months, if Joe Biden looks great, they don't need to think about this ever again.
*  But if in four months, Joe Biden is looking bad, if it is looking like he is going to
*  lose to Donald Trump, going to create a second Trump presidency with everything we know about
*  that guy, well, then I think it's really important Democrats don't lapse into a kind of white-knuckled
*  fatalism, believing that it's Biden or nothing.
*  And all they can do is stay on this train that seems like it is derailing.
*  That's why I want people thinking about how a convention would look and feel right now.
*  Running Joe Biden is a risk.
*  A convention is a risk.
*  These risks come with upside potential and downside potential.
*  And you know, life is an endless process of risk management.
*  Like I would like to tell you, I would like to tell myself, there is some way to not have
*  to play the probabilities here to bet on this with house money and be assured of a win.
*  But nobody has that, right?
*  I wish, like it would be nice.
*  I would like to not worry about this election at all.
*  I don't particularly like, I don't like covering elections.
*  I find them too stressful.
*  You know, but Joe Biden is not at 56.
*  If he were, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
*  He's at, you know, 38, 39 in favorability and a couple points behind Donald Trump in
*  the polls.
*  And so people need to be thinking about what happens if that continues to deteriorate.
*  So you don't think it necessarily makes sense for Biden to drop out now, but a month from
*  now, two months from now, is a wait and see.
*  I wouldn't say it makes sense.
*  Like Chris, I don't think he will drop out now.
*  I don't think the situation is dire enough.
*  I don't think the people around him are going to come to him and make that argument.
*  But that's going to be the thing that is playing out over the next four months.
*  If things look worse four months from now than they do now, there's going to be real
*  panic.
*  I was looking at the 538 page for presidential approval ratings.
*  If you scroll down that page, they compare the current president, Joe Biden, in this
*  case, with other presidents at this point in their terms.
*  Obama's favorability was way higher than Biden's.
*  It was almost 10 points higher.
*  Donald Trump's favorability was higher than Joe Biden's at this point, and Donald Trump
*  lost the election.
*  You could just like go right down the list.
*  I mean, Bill Clinton way above Joe Biden right now.
*  Jimmy Carter was above Joe Biden right now.
*  So Biden is polling at a place that should have people worried.
*  His favorability ratings are in everything, but if they don't start turning around and
*  he is behind Donald Trump, I mean, remember, in every election in which we have seen him
*  run, Donald Trump has outperformed his polling.
*  He was quite a lot behind Hillary Clinton, quite a lot behind Joe Biden, at least in
*  key states, and he did better than that in every election we have seen him in.
*  So a situation where Biden is actually behind Donald Trump, I mean, I assume the Democratic
*  Party really does not want Donald Trump to win.
*  Maybe I'm wrong about that, but if they see him on a path to winning, I have to assume
*  things are going to change in their minds and again, potentially in Joe Biden's himself.
*  So we did like an episode a couple months ago about how the polls this far out don't
*  matter and you're saying that at a certain point they start mattering.
*  Yeah, we're no longer at the point where polls are completely non-productive.
*  All right, on to our next question.
*  And we have lots of questions coming up about the strategic risks of a convention and the
*  relative strengths of different candidates.
*  But this one is partly about strategy, but also about the principle of the thing.
*  Hi, Agra. Long time, listen to this first time caller.
*  I couldn't help but think, you know, isn't this as in like choosing a new presidential
*  candidate at the convention, is that a little bit undemocratic, which is like the Democratic
*  Party's whole thing right now with like.
*  We have to save democracy.
*  I think it's a great question.
*  And let me answer it on two levels.
*  So one is the very specific level right now, which is the scenario I'm describing.
*  The only scenario of a convention I can imagine is one in which Joe Biden himself drops out.
*  If Biden gives a sorrowful but determined speech in June, saying that he's come to the
*  conclusion that it doesn't serve the country for him to run again, that's not going to be
*  Democratic elders making some weird move.
*  There's going to be a convention process because there will have to be a convention process.
*  And I think people will get that right.
*  They will have seen Joe Biden make this decision that led to the convention.
*  So that is a specific answer.
*  But I also want to give a general one, which is that I don't really buy the convention
*  is less democratic than a primary.
*  Take this primary.
*  If you look at polling throughout it, most Democrats say they did not want Biden to run
*  again. They did not want that in 2022.
*  They did not want that in 2023.
*  There's a CNN poll back in September.
*  There's been all this talk like the media has made Joe Biden's age into an issue recently.
*  But this is September. This is not when it was getting a ton of coverage.
*  Two thirds of Democratic leaning voters said they did not want Joe Biden running again.
*  But the party pressure was such that no major Democrat challenged him.
*  You had Dean Phillips, who was a Minnesota congressman with no national profile.
*  And his challenge is, I think, a move of a lot of political courage.
*  But that's not the person Democrats were looking to elect you of Marianne Williamson.
*  But the primary was not democratic.
*  People were not given a lot of options.
*  The party very tightly structured who is going to be in the field.
*  And so even though Democrats were saying in poll after poll after poll, we would like
*  options, we are not comfortable with this campaign.
*  They weren't given any of those options.
*  This is something that I ended up talking about a little bit with Elaine K.
*  Mark on the show a few days ago, which is conventions are representative democracy
*  and primaries are direct democracy.
*  And both have a problem. Right.
*  Representative democracy, when you're turning things over to the representatives, well,
*  you might have chosen such and such governor or such and such senator, but maybe they're
*  not doing a good job representing you.
*  Right. Maybe your representative has diverged from your interests, your values, whatever.
*  But the problem with primaries is that very few people vote.
*  This is always a problem with direct democracy.
*  Direct democracy is often non-representative because you have five percent, seven percent,
*  eleven percent, nineteen percent of the electorate coming out.
*  And that part of the electorate is not a normal part of the electorate.
*  Right. The people who are choosing to vote in primaries are very highly informed, very
*  highly ideological comparatively.
*  They're mobilized through certain kinds of organizations in a different way.
*  A lot of Americans are independents and they functionally have no choice over who the two
*  parties run in many, many, many states, even though how they vote ends up deciding who
*  wins. So whatever we have right now, I would not call it highly small-d democratic.
*  I'll also say the primaries to me often don't end up making the most strategic decisions.
*  And, you know, just look over the Republican side.
*  It is still my view that no matter how badly DeSantis did in the campaign, he would have
*  been a stronger general election candidate for the Republicans than Donald Trump is.
*  If I were betting money on a DeSantis-Biden matchup versus a Trump-Biden matchup, to me,
*  Trump-Biden remains something close to even odds, maybe a bit more, maybe a bit less on
*  that for Joe Biden, depending on the day.
*  I think DeSantis would win and I think Nikki Haley would win.
*  So primaries, again, they're weird.
*  The people voting in them are weird.
*  It's not that many people and they are voting based on things that are not strategic.
*  In theory, at least, conventions are making more strategic decisions and taking in a
*  broader range of information, but probably are not as good at judging charisma and
*  enthusiasm. So, I mean, you can take your pick of which of those you like, but I've
*  just never bought this idea that the primaries are really democratic.
*  So this next question was emailed in from Jeremy G.
*  And he wrote that he believes an underappreciated achievement of President Biden has
*  been his ability to bridge the differences between moderate, liberal and progressive
*  Democrats and maintain a modicum of unity.
*  And he wrote that he believes that the president's ability to bridge the differences
*  between moderate, liberal and progressive Democrats and maintain a modicum of unity
*  in the midst of Republican disunity.
*  And you spoke to this in the beginning of your audio essay.
*  Do you have concerns that a contested convention would just turn into open warfare
*  between the moderates and the progressives that could end up weakening turnout among
*  the faction that loses?
*  I very much agree.
*  This has been an underappreciated strength of Joe Biden going back to 2020.
*  Right. It's something, as you say, that I talked about in that first piece.
*  I don't think it is his strength now.
*  So I guess something I would say is I'm not more or less worried about that now at a
*  convention than in a Biden runs again scenario.
*  And the primary reason is that there's a tremendous amount of disillusionment with
*  Biden on the left now because of Gaza.
*  So the thing that Biden has done so well to bridge gaps, he's not being able to do.
*  One interesting threat of reaction I saw to the piece was that he was not going to
*  One interesting threat of reaction I saw to the piece, which I did not expect, was a
*  bunch of people saying that this is great because they don't want to vote for Biden
*  on Gaza. And so maybe there's a possibility of another candidate.
*  I think it's possible to imagine tickets emerging that would be able to bridge Gaza in
*  a different way than he now can because the ticket would not have been responsible for
*  early American policy on it.
*  But even putting that aside, what's holding the Democratic Party together right now
*  isn't Joe Biden, it's Donald Trump.
*  I suspect the Democratic convention would be very focused on the dangerous Trump
*  poses, very focused on the plan for beating him.
*  And that's also, of course, the Biden campaign's plan for managing the disagreements
*  inside the Democratic Party and the lack of enthusiasm for Biden himself.
*  Right. The Biden team's theory of this whole thing is counter mobilization, that
*  Donald Trump is going to be out there.
*  He's going to be getting a lot more press coverage.
*  And in doing that, he's going to mobilize the Democratic base, kind of heal any
*  schisms, get over the disillusionment.
*  I do think it's important to say that any choice Democrats make here is a choice of
*  risk. With Biden right now, the risk to me does not feel like it is controllable.
*  You can't stop him from having these senior moments on the trail except by keeping him
*  off the trail. With the convention, the risk is of a type that Democrats can make
*  strategic decisions about.
*  They can balance a ticket with a moderate and progressive.
*  They can think hard about the states the ticket comes from.
*  They can use the platform and the policy agenda to smooth out disagreements.
*  That's like how conventions have worked since time immemorial.
*  And then and I do think this is important to my thinking here.
*  The risk to the upside seems higher to me in a convention.
*  I don't think Biden has that much likelihood of really changing how people feel about
*  him this year, at least not unless he proves himself to be a different kind of
*  campaigner than we're currently seeing.
*  But a sufficiently exciting ticket might be able to mobilize Democrats through
*  enthusiasm for new leadership, not just opposition to Trump.
*  So you might be able to combine more mobilization and counter mobilization.
*  But I don't want to wave away the question here.
*  Yes, like there are schisms in the Democratic Party right now.
*  The big one is Gaza. I see that as a very big problem for Biden.
*  But it could just be a problem for Democrats no matter what.
*  In any of the scenarios you might imagine, they're going to have to find a way to say
*  not lose Michigan because Arab-American voters are furious at the Biden
*  administration and at Democrats.
*  And then there's the obvious way this could go badly.
*  The one I hear a lot of people worrying about is that the delegates don't choose
*  Kamala Harris, who is the obvious candidate who has experience for 2020, is Joe
*  Biden's VP. And that creates a schism with black voters or just creates an ugly
*  convention while that process plays itself out.
*  I've heard some people say things like it would be unprecedented not to have the VP
*  become the nominee. And I do think that's a funny thing to say right now, because
*  we just saw that happen in 2016.
*  Joe Biden was Barack Obama's vice president.
*  He was discouraged by people around Obama from running again.
*  They wanted to pass it on to Hillary Clinton, who they thought was not just a more
*  historic candidate, but they also thought was a stronger candidate within the
*  administration. She was more respected.
*  That does lead to some even now ill will between the Biden and the Obama camps,
*  particularly the people in strategic positions in them.
*  But it's not always the case that the VP is the one who gets the next nod.
*  But in this particular case, I think people are worried about whether or not that
*  would go badly. And I think it very much could go badly, depending on how it
*  played out.
*  So you just brought up Kamala Harris.
*  So let's go to our Kamala Harris question.
*  This is another voicemail.
*  Hello, Ezra. My name is Matt and I'm calling from Brooklyn, New York.
*  My question for you is in regards to your recent essay about Joe Biden's age
*  and particularly pertaining to Vice President Harris.
*  I'm curious as to what you think the people find so displeasing
*  about her, given her approval rating is lower than Biden, even though you in
*  private settings, she is viewed in a warm and attractive light.
*  I'm just curious on what your thoughts are on that.
*  Thank you.
*  Yeah, so this is tricky territory.
*  Let me say a couple of things here.
*  Try to put your head back in 2020 when she gets chosen for vice president.
*  There is not an immediate reaction among the commentariat, among politicos, among
*  Democrats of like, what a crazy decision by Joe Biden.
*  That is not how the Harris vice presidency is greeted.
*  Then over the next couple of years, something happens and Harris's vice
*  presidency is widely considered to be a kind of failure or at least not going well.
*  But if you try to look for what happened, you're not going to find a whole lot.
*  It isn't like she gave some disastrous speech, like she screwed up some huge job
*  they gave her, like anything happened in public that you can point to.
*  There were a number of stories in newspapers and political and places like that,
*  that there was a lot of stuff turnover, that her office was a kind of unhappy
*  place in which to work, that things weren't kind of running that well over there.
*  In polling, she was consistently polling a little bit worse than Joe Biden,
*  which freaked people out.
*  I also think something happened here where the kind of politics that was very
*  strong in 2020 that Harris represented in the sort of post George Floyd moment,
*  in a moment when the sort of backlash to what gets called now wokeness was not
*  quite so strong, began to feel less like it was like the future of the Democratic
*  Party and more like a faction within the Democratic Party, that Harris is not a
*  politician like Joe Biden in the way that say, when Bill Clinton chose Al Gore,
*  he chose like another kind of moderate Southern Democrat.
*  She's a politician representing Joe Biden's recognition at that time that he
*  was maybe the end of something and he was going to pass on the torch of the
*  party to somebody representing a new strain of its politics.
*  But that strain of politics either weakened or people believed it weakened or
*  maybe not that Harris was going to be the standard bearer for it.
*  But to me, this is all pretty thin.
*  It's all pretty thin.
*  If you ask me, not like what Washington thinks of her, but what I think of her,
*  I think Harris is much more talented than people give her credit for.
*  I think she has something that I've seen with many politicians who are, to just
*  be blunt about this, women or black where people will say, where I will tell
*  you that in private, she's enormously warm and charismatic and funny and
*  compelling and then much more cautious and it seems very scripted on the stage.
*  And I think that's a very unfair way that candidates from different backgrounds
*  get pushed to the side, right?
*  Yeah, if you're Joe Biden, if you're Donald Trump, you're allowed to kind of
*  go out and say any old thing and you seem authentic, you seem at home, but
*  like this is something people always said about Hillary Clinton too.
*  And it was true about Hillary Clinton that she was amazing in small settings
*  and not that good on the stump.
*  But there was a reason for that, right?
*  There was a reason that Clinton had learned to be cautious.
*  There's a reason Harris has learned to be cautious.
*  And so when you ask, what is it that people find displeasing?
*  I think candidates like Harris are caught in a bind between not showing
*  too much of themselves in a world that has not always been open to them
*  as full people, but then they get to a certain level and it's like, well, why
*  do you seem so held back?
*  Why do you seem so controlled and contained?
*  I have my own views on Harris, right?
*  I'm a Californian.
*  I think Harris was a very strong candidate in California, right?
*  She became attorney general.
*  She became a Senator.
*  She ran for president.
*  She was neither, I think, a, like a generationally talented campaigner at
*  any of those levels, but nor was she a bad campaigner at any of them.
*  She didn't do a crappy job in the Senate campaign, did not do a bad
*  job running for attorney general, did not do a bad job running in 2020, in my view.
*  Again, did not win in 2020, dropped out early, but she was a little bit trapped
*  in between the moderate and progressive lanes.
*  She was like to Joe Biden's left, but to Bernie Sanders' right, she didn't
*  have that much name recognition.
*  It was going to be a hard campaign.
*  And I think the problem for Harris is that her politics are very rooted in California.
*  And so I think the kind of voter she is comfortable winning over and comfortable
*  tuning a message to is a left of center Californian voter.
*  Doesn't mean a very liberal voter.
*  I mean, when she was running for attorney general, she ran as a sort of more
*  moderate, smart on crime Democrat.
*  And there are people who are more moderate in the party, Matt Iglesias at
*  the Newsletters Still Boring has made this argument a number of times, who think
*  actually that older politics would make a lot of sense for her now, that like
*  Harris should sort of reemerge as like a tough on crime, smart on crime, more
*  moderate kind of prosecutor like.
*  But in 2020, she kind of abandoned all that.
*  If people remember, there was this kind of internet meme that, you know, Kamala
*  Harris is a cop because being in any way associated with law enforcement was really
*  bad politics that year.
*  May not be such bad politics now, but Harris's politics have a kind of very
*  Californian root to them.
*  And so the question of how does she win over voters in Pennsylvania, in Michigan?
*  How good is she at winning over voters with a very different context who are much
*  more moderate?
*  That is where when I kind of hear her give her speeches and tune her message and
*  think about politics, I get more worried about her.
*  That I think she doesn't always hold a kind of voter who is unlike the ones that
*  she has traditionally known how to win very well in her head.
*  Whereas Joe Biden, who comes from Delaware, who is roots in Pennsylvania, he was
*  very well tuned to winning over those voters.
*  The reason people get excited about Whitmer and Shapiro and so on is that they're
*  worried about Democrats winning Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and
*  Georgia and, you know, Arizona.
*  And so candidates who have demonstrated a facility with voters in those states
*  have a kind of strategic advantage.
*  And that isn't something Harris has had to do or has done before.
*  But again, I've said this now for a long time.
*  I always thought she was going to have a very good 2024.
*  That I thought the bar had now been set so low for her, that it was going to be
*  almost trivial for her to clear it.
*  And that she's a better, you know, speech giver, a better debater, better on offense
*  than a lot of politicians are.
*  And that a lot of opinions were going to turn around on her in 2024.
*  And I still basically believe that.
*  I don't know if Harris is the right candidate for the Democratic Party, but I
*  don't think that the drop in esteem for her is based on anything all that real.
*  All right.
*  Our next question packs a lot in.
*  Hey, Ezra.
*  Jon Favreau here.
*  First time, long time.
*  I appreciate your piece and share a lot of your concerns, as do most voters,
*  including most Democrats.
*  I think the challenge is we just don't know and really can't ever know if
*  nominating Biden is riskier than letting Democratic activists and insiders pick a
*  lesser known and potentially weaker general election candidate at the convention in
*  Chicago with just three months to go.
*  There hasn't been much polling on how other Democrats might fare against Trump.
*  But from what we've seen, people like Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, Gretchen
*  Whitmer, pull similar or worse than Biden against Trump.
*  Now, some of that might just be because fewer voters are familiar with them, which
*  would obviously change if one of them became the nominee.
*  But if you're Biden, you have to be thinking that a decision to step aside also
*  comes with a real risk that the party will nominate someone who loses to Trump.
*  And my sense is that's a big reason he's unlikely to do so.
*  Thanks, Jon, for being such a good friend of the pod.
*  So let me try to actually make the strongest version of this argument
*  against what I'm saying.
*  There was a recent poll that had Biden losing to Trump 45 to 44.
*  It had Harris losing to Trump 46 to 43.
*  It had Gavin Newsom losing to Trump 46 to 36 and had Gretchen Whitmer losing to
*  Trump 45 to 33.
*  So if you're just taking that poll at face value, it isn't just that Newsom or
*  Whitmer would do worse than Biden or Harris, but they would get destroyed
*  compared to Biden or Harris.
*  And bluntly, I just don't buy this at all.
*  I think polls like this are just pure name recognition at this juncture.
*  Just most Americans have no idea who Gretchen Whitmer is.
*  If you are listening to this show, you are a weird politics junkie.
*  You have a level of political information and you're willing to give a level of
*  your time to politics that virtually no one is willing to do.
*  If you are listening to this show and you don't live in Michigan, how many Gretchen
*  Whitmer speeches have you actually seen?
*  Like how much do you actually know about her?
*  I guess for most people, the answer is zero Gretchen Whitmer speeches.
*  Most people have seen maybe one at the 2020 Democratic convention.
*  I think if you want to look at more usable data, you want to look where you
*  have name recognition between the candidates.
*  So if you look at polling in Michigan, where both Joe Biden and Gretchen Whitmer
*  are well known, Whitmer is running ahead of Biden against Trump by quite a lot.
*  So there's a January poll from the Glenn Garif group, which found Biden losing to
*  Trump by eight in Michigan, but Whitmer beating Trump by four.
*  I've seen other polling from Pennsylvania that says Josh Shapiro is much more
*  popular in Pennsylvania than Joe Biden is.
*  So you can ask, will that generalize?
*  I think there's a good chance that it will.
*  But to me, this all comes down to upside and downside risk.
*  My worry with Biden is I think he has more downside risk than upside risk at this point.
*  It's a likelier that something goes really wrong that crystallizes people's fears
*  about him being president for four more years, then something goes really right.
*  That boosts his support sharply.
*  But look, I would like to be wrong about this.
*  I would like to see the next three or four months play out where things go really
*  right and Biden seems like a political juggernaut or just like a quite strong
*  incumbent candidate, and then everybody can make fun of me for these pieces down
*  the road.
*  But if that doesn't happen with these other candidates, and I do think this goes
*  for Harris too, she's just functionally polling like Biden, but I think they all
*  have more upside risk.
*  People might be really excited about some of the possible tickets that could emerge
*  here.
*  They might be really excited about the people they would see at the convention
*  and the speeches and so on.
*  And so as people got to know them, I mean, if they were any candidate chosen at the
*  convention, it's going to rocket to functionally 100% name ID.
*  And when it does that, the polling is going to look very different.
*  This was from David, who was worried that Democrats would end up picking a candidate
*  who seems great, but then they have skeletons in their closet that come out on
*  the campaign.
*  So I think this depends a bit on what kind of lead up we've had to the convention.
*  So if Biden steps aside in late May or June, you then have months of scrutiny on
*  the possible candidates, a lot of CNN and MSNBC town halls, a kind of multi month
*  vetting process in the mass media.
*  So I'd be less worried about the skeletons in the closet question.
*  And also just to be honest, I have trouble believing any candidate is going to
*  compare poorly with what is stuffed in the Mar-a-Lago closets.
*  So that doesn't really feel to me like such a worrying matchup, but particularly
*  the scenario where there's not much time to vet the candidates, I think you can
*  imagine a candidate who looks good on paper, like a Gretchen Whitmer or Josh
*  Shapiro proving unable to bring it under the full force of a presidential campaign.
*  We know that Shapiro and Whitmer have performed really well in say Pennsylvania
*  and Michigan respectively.
*  But there is something about presidential campaigns is different, something about
*  the debates, something about just like the level of scrutiny and intensity.
*  And that can prove to be a problem.
*  This might make you think that what you actually want is a candidate who proved
*  pretty strong as a campaigner in 2020.
*  I think Amy Klobuchar is somebody who has consistently overperformed in Minnesota,
*  which is a state very much like Wisconsin, very much like some of these other
*  Midwestern states that Democrats need to win in.
*  And she did a good job on the campaign trail in 2020.
*  And so I think Amy Klobuchar is like, you should understand her as a real
*  political talent.
*  Again, this goes back to my, I just don't think primaries are the be all and end
*  all. They have weird dynamics.
*  They have big name ID dynamics.
*  And so people who were able to break out and be serious candidates and campaign
*  without making huge mistakes, that's the kind of thing I'm looking for that we
*  don't know yet about a Whitmer, about a Shapiro, about really anybody who hasn't
*  run at the presidential level.
*  I do think that there is a preference for new faces when people kind of imagine
*  these scenarios, but experience under the presidential level should not be taken
*  for granted.
*  So we did a whole episode about how the Democrats have been losing the white
*  working class.
*  And I think part of Biden's strength was that he was able to stem those losses in
*  the last election because of Biden, because of who he is.
*  Do you think that that's a huge risk here?
*  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't put this primarily on the white working class.
*  You have to win the most votes in the states Democrats need to take the
*  Electoral College.
*  And there are different ways you could put that together.
*  What Biden really did was not improve a lot among the white working class.
*  He improved among college educated whites, which turned out to work and was
*  enough.
*  But this is why I think there's a lot of interest in candidates who are winning
*  the states Democrats need to win in.
*  Again, this is why people mention, why I mentioned Shapiro, why I mentioned
*  Whitmer, why I mentioned people like Raphael Warnock, why I think you should
*  think very hard about candidates from states where Democrats need a majority.
*  I don't particularly care how that majority gets put together.
*  Whether that majority is put together with more young voters, because you get
*  a lot of young voter turnout, whether it's more multi-ethnic coalition, whether
*  it's, you know, different states have different dynamics and you can imagine a
*  candidate who's going to be really good at putting together a coalition in
*  Georgia, in Arizona, but maybe not quite as good in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin.
*  Michigan, again, because of the Arab American vote there, and Michigan has
*  been close, is going to be a tricky place for Democrats right now.
*  This is really the kind of thing you would imagine being debated at a
*  convention.
*  When the delegates get together in a room and they've heard the speeches in
*  public and they've seen the interviews the candidates are giving on TV and
*  they've had the candidates come and give their presentations and they've had the
*  candidates, deputies and campaign managers and liaisons come and make the
*  case to them, they're going to sit there and say, if you're the Pennsylvania
*  delegation, well, who do I think can really win Pennsylvania?
*  If you're the Michigan delegation, who do I really think can win Michigan?
*  And in theory, the Michigan delegation knows a lot about winning Michigan.
*  They have a sense of who the voters in Michigan are.
*  And so this would be the thing that all these candidates would be out there
*  trying to persuade people of, right?
*  That they have a pathway, that they have a way of seeing the electorate that is
*  going to appeal to these particular states.
*  So the convention picks a ticket and this next question is about what happens next.
*  This is from Evan.
*  Hey, this is Evan calling from Maryland.
*  I wanted to thank you for your most recent episode because it's a question
*  that I'm sure for myself and for a lot of voters is really exciting, but also
*  really scary.
*  And I think one of those sources of fear to take this leap of faith for a new
*  democratic candidate is, okay, let's say that we elect someone to run the party
*  in August.
*  We only have three months to go through the process.
*  And I'm just wondering if that's enough time to run a national campaign,
*  especially for some of these newer generation politicians like Wes Moore,
*  who I love, but I'm just worried it's three months enough time.
*  Thanks so much.
*  So I'm not very worried about this for a bunch of different reasons.
*  One reason is that in most countries, like that is how long elections are, or it is
*  longer than elections are.
*  We just have very long elections in America and it is not clear to me at all
*  the candidates benefit from that long period of time out in the public eye.
*  This is by the way, particularly true for the current two candidates, Joe Biden
*  and Donald Trump, who have both been in the public eye for a long time now and
*  are both extremely unpopular.
*  So I'm not too worried about that.
*  The other dimension is that think about the reasons people vote.
*  So the first and strongest motivator on the democratic side this year is going to
*  be anti-Trump sentiment.
*  So most Democrats are coming out to vote against Donald Trump, no matter what else
*  is going on.
*  That is what is going to get Democrats to a pretty high level in the vote.
*  And frankly, if you listen to a lot of the strategists on the Democratic side, they're
*  really saying that is what is going to get the Democrats to victory.
*  I just have not heard anybody make the case to me that Democrats are coming out for
*  Joe Biden or frankly for Democrats in general, that you're creating this anti-MAGA
*  majority. And as long as you've got MAGA on the other side of the ticket, you're
*  going to win. If Republicans had chosen Nikki Haley, Democrats would have had to
*  come up with another strategy.
*  And I think they would have very cluckily found out they don't actually have
*  another strategy and they might have ended up in real trouble here.
*  And then you would have a tremendous burst of almost an overwhelming amount of
*  focus and press and energy and attention on the election.
*  People don't need that long to get to know somebody, to get excited about them, to
*  see them. In fact, I think three months, even three months would end up feeling like
*  quite a long time. So you have this incredibly dramatic, unexpected,
*  unprecedented within the last 50 years convention on the Democratic side.
*  Everybody is watching it. The press is covering it all the time.
*  The press have been covering the run up to it all the time.
*  And then it's September and you have all of September where just like wall to wall
*  coverage of this thing and all of October into November when you have the actual
*  election. That's actually to me quite a lot of time.
*  This isn't 1978.
*  It's pretty quick to cut and add.
*  You could just like at this point wander over to GPT-4 and be like, what do you
*  think a good ad for Westmore would be?
*  And they'll give it to you in a second, basically.
*  And so I'm just not concerned about this.
*  I'm actually I am more concerned about the amount of time this campaign is going
*  to stretch on for both Joe Biden and Donald Trump, given the way they're both
*  campaigning, than what it would mean to have a sprint campaign for like an
*  exciting new ticket coming out of a convention.
*  What about ground game for a candidate that say just doesn't have a lot of
*  friends in Michigan and Wisconsin because they haven't been campaigning for a
*  year?
*  That's what a political party is for.
*  That is what the party is supposed to be doing.
*  There's elections happening in every single one of these states.
*  There's campaign offices happening in every one of these states.
*  I mean, the Biden campaign is still funding things.
*  That money is usable, right?
*  I don't imagine they would close everything down.
*  And this is also what Trump did in 2016.
*  Like Trump had functionally no campaign mechanics happening in 2016.
*  He was running this very strange and surging campaign, and it was the RNC
*  that took care of the ground game.
*  Trump did not have a highly organized, disciplined operation.
*  One reason he's going to be potentially a stronger candidate in 2024 is he does
*  have a much more professional campaign happening around him that is like opening
*  offices in the right places and hiring field organizers.
*  But that is something the party is supposed to be doing all across the country.
*  And has been doing, right?
*  A reason that Democrats have done well in Michigan is that the Michigan
*  Democratic Party has done an extraordinary job organizing in Michigan, and that
*  infrastructure is all being built for 2024.
*  The reason they're doing well in Wisconsin is an extraordinary amount of
*  energy has gone into building infrastructure in Wisconsin, and that has
*  all been being built with the attention on 2024.
*  And like you can go state by state.
*  The things that have won Georgia for Democrats in recent years have not gone
*  away.
*  They're all being built.
*  So yeah, this is just not a part of it that worries me all that much.
*  And then the final thing I would just say is that ground game is great.
*  What you need is enthusiasm.
*  Enthusiasm against Donald Trump, enthusiasm for a ticket, but more than
*  anything else, the thing you want, the thing a ground game needs to have is
*  an enthusiastic voter pool.
*  And so like the first and most important thing is your product.
*  Not how you market your product, not how you distribute your product.
*  The first and most important thing is that people want your product.
*  And so I don't want to say everything takes care of itself if the product is
*  good, but a lot more can be taken care of if the product is good.
*  So this question is more about the upside of a convention and the kind of
*  ticket that could come out of it.
*  And it's another voicemail.
*  My name is Eve.
*  I'm calling from New York.
*  I, like many voters on the left have been really checked out of
*  Biden's presidency.
*  Haven't really been excited about any political candidates since Bernie Sanders.
*  So I haven't really considered anything to do with politics.
*  It's just being appealing to me.
*  So I'm just wondering in this potential world where Biden is at the side, if
*  you could talk a little bit about some of the political futures that you could
*  imagine coming from candidates on the left and how some of them might be able
*  to appeal to voters like me who have been really disillusioned by Joe Biden and
*  the democratic party at large, especially since their position on Israel-Palestine.
*  Okay.
*  Thank you.
*  Bye.
*  The honest answer is I don't know to this.
*  I suspect that a convention would be trying to choose a very highly strategic
*  ticket more than a highly ideological ticket.
*  And so it'd be very focused on people who they thought could win, you know,
*  the kind of five key states.
*  But I do think they would care about enthusiasm.
*  And I do think depending on how things go, there's going to be a lot of
*  concern about Gaza and the ruptures in the democratic party over this.
*  And so the possibility of a new ticket allows them to have someone or some set
*  of candidates who doesn't have to defend and doesn't have to be yoked to every
*  moment of the Biden administration support for Netanyahu right now.
*  I mean, this is where all this started, right?
*  Biden comes back at that press conference to give an answer saying that he thinks
*  Netanyahu's invasion now is over the top.
*  And that's when he makes the CC as president of Mexico flub.
*  But what was really happening in that question is Biden trying to sort of shift
*  the energy and the orientation of his administration, right?
*  He says, as you all know, I think, right?
*  I'm not sure most people did know that, but the thing that even as they are
*  rhetorically beginning to move a little bit on this, they are not yet
*  substantively moving on this.
*  The America just vetoed another UN resolution calling for a ceasefire.
*  We have put forward our own more compromised resolution saying there
*  should be a humanitarian pause, like a temporary ceasefire, also calling for
*  the return of hostages saying the ceasefire should happen as soon as is
*  practicable, like who decides what is practicable.
*  I, at this point, believe that the Biden administration's position on this is
*  not really defensible anymore.
*  Netanyahu is not listening to them.
*  They are not supporting Israel.
*  They are supporting him.
*  And Netanyahu has been very clear that virtually all the things Joe Biden
*  thinks about Israel and Palestine, Netanyahu does not think.
*  Netanyahu does not think Palestine should be running Gaza after all this is over.
*  Netanyahu does not think the Israeli military should be acting with a lot
*  more restraint than it currently is.
*  Netanyahu does not think that we should be on a path to a two-state solution.
*  And Netanyahu has been extremely clear about all of this and the consequences
*  he has faced for it, at least publicly from Joe Biden, are none.
*  There's really interesting reporting recently that Richard Haass, who's a,
*  just until a year or two ago, was president of the Council on Foreign Relations,
*  is now president emeritus.
*  He is like the center of the foreign policy establishment in the United States.
*  Right?
*  Like the most establishment figure.
*  You can imagine he's been really trying to say to the Biden administration
*  and going out and lobbying them, like, you have to shift policy here.
*  And he's been saying that Biden specifically should go give a speech
*  at the Knesset, the sort of Israeli legislature, arguing, going over
*  Netanyahu's head, by the way, as Netanyahu has done here before, coming,
*  going over Barack Obama's head and giving a speech to Congress,
*  calling for another pathway.
*  So far, this has not apparently been met with any take-up from the Biden
*  administration.
*  But Haass, I think, is right that Biden would need to do something at this point
*  fairly spectacular to change people's views about where he is.
*  Kind of criticizing Netanyahu a little bit on the margins, but not actually
*  shifting the substance of American policy is not going to do it.
*  So either Biden has to do something really big or in this kind of convention
*  scenario, you might get a ticket that just doesn't have his baggage, a ticket
*  that is younger, that was not backing Netanyahu to the hilt kind of like all the
*  way through this and could just have a different policy and would just have more
*  credibility on having a different policy.
*  The only other thing I will say on this, though, is that, again, we're speaking
*  in February, this is August.
*  It might all look worse in August, right?
*  That is a possibility, too.
*  And I take very seriously the depth of the anger towards the Biden
*  administration on this issue.
*  I think early on, I was pretty skeptical this would be a voting issue for
*  people, but I think for, you know, if you are on social media and you've been
*  plugged into this in the last couple of months, I think the depth of dissolution
*  that was Joe Biden is very hard to convey.
*  And I don't think it's going to go away.
*  At least not easily, at least not with some kind of major change.
*  So, you know, you could imagine someone else being able to put the party in a
*  different place here, but where the whole situation will be by then is so
*  unknowable to me now that I'm cautious about making any predictions about the
*  role it will or won't play at a convention.
*  What do you think is the best argument against your argument for a convention?
*  Look, I think the best argument against my argument is that you think Joe Biden
*  and Kamala Harris are a strong ticket.
*  And one of the things that has, I don't know if I want to say it surprised me or
*  it's freaked me out, but is for all the brickbats I've gotten on this, I've not
*  seen one email, not seen one reply on social media, not one voicemail to my
*  knowledge, maybe I missed something.
*  I definitely could have.
*  Making this argument.
*  The Democratic party is just constantly sending me emails telling me Donald
*  Trump is an existential threat to democracy, that he is an existential
*  threat to the country.
*  And I believe them.
*  I think that's true.
*  I think Donald Trump, existential is a strong word, but I think Trump is very,
*  very dangerous.
*  And the primary strategic decision Democrats have to make in terms of
*  beating him is their ticket.
*  That is the main point of leverage they have over this election.
*  Every campaign decision downstream from that is less important than that crucial
*  decision.
*  So if you think Biden and Harris are a strong ticket or they show themselves in
*  the coming months to be a strong ticket, fantastic.
*  That is your, in general, incumbents are very strong.
*  Most incumbents get reelected.
*  In general, you don't want to switch horses midstream, right?
*  Doing something that is risky and unusual and that people have not done for a long
*  time carries a lot of risk.
*  And so the best argument against it is that the ticket Democrats have is strong,
*  is likely to win, and there's no need to change it.
*  And if that's what you believe, great.
*  You know, my argument right now is that that is not what I am starting to believe.
*  Now I could just be wrong.
*  I have changed my view on this from where I was six months ago, but maybe they're
*  just off to a slow start.
*  Maybe over the next three or four or five months, everything kicks into gear and
*  their paid advertising campaign is excellent.
*  And we begin to see the movement that one would want to see.
*  But if you don't see that, I mean, I guess a challenge I would offer to a lot of
*  people is to like say in your own mind, what would you need to see?
*  What would be the evidence to you that the ticket was weak and that if Democrats
*  want to beat Trump, they should change it.
*  I think that the question that a lot of people, particularly in the Democratic
*  party and at its high level should be asking is what is your red line?
*  Imagine yourself in May.
*  Imagine yourself in May.
*  When you're talking about May, June, polling is pretty predictive.
*  We tend to have a pretty good idea what's going on in an election by May or June.
*  So what would you need to see in May or June to feel comfortable?
*  And what would you need to see in May or June to feel like, no,
*  we're on the wrong path here?
*  A journalist friend of mine said to me recently in response to my piece, that
*  his read on the Democrats was that they would prefer to lose in a way that is
*  comfortable for them than to win in a way that is uncomfortable for them.
*  That if Joe Biden is renominated and he loses, nobody's really going to be blamed
*  for that, but Joe Biden.
*  I think that might be wrong.
*  And there might actually ultimately be a lot of backlash for the Democratic
*  establishment for running a candidate who a lot of Democrats are like, this
*  seems like not a great idea, but whatever.
*  That is a safe way to lose.
*  By contrast, if you come out against the ticket and the ticket maintains, then
*  you have put yourself crosswise with the Biden administration.
*  If you come out for a convention and the convention fails reputationally, then
*  you're in real trouble.
*  You put your head out and Democrats did this thing and it went badly.
*  And how dare you, if only they had stuck with Biden, it all would have been fine.
*  It's very easy to see from a perspective of people's individual incentives, how
*  it would make more sense to stick with the Biden Harris ticket, even if you
*  don't think the Biden Harris ticket is going to win.
*  But I think what I am trying to say is that that is an abdication of duty.
*  That is an abdication of what a party is supposed to do.
*  And it is much more so an abdication of what a party is supposed to do when the
*  party believes the other candidate is as dangerous as they believe Donald Trump is.
*  It's not Mitt Romney here.
*  It's not George H.W.
*  Bush.
*  If you think Donald Trump is going to win, you have to do something about it.
*  Otherwise you've kind of just been lying to people and lying to yourself.
*  So look, if you get to May, June, and you think Donald Trump is going to lose,
*  Biden is now up by three, people are focusing in on Donald Trump.
*  They like what they see with Biden.
*  They don't like what they see with Trump.
*  Fantastic.
*  Write all this off.
*  But if you get to May, June, and Biden is down by three, and Trump seems stronger,
*  and Biden's not performing well on the campaign trail, and you don't think he's
*  going to win, and you don't really understand what this turnaround is supposed to be.
*  Well, then you have to ask yourself, what are you here for?
*  What is your job in this?
*  What are you going to feel good about having done or not done on
*  the other side of the election?
*  Thank you, Claire, for sitting in on this with me.
