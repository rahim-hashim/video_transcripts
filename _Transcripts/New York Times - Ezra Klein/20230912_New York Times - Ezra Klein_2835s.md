# America’s Top Librarian on the Rise of Book Bans
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [September 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om4MubfobEU)
*  From New York Times Opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  Hey it is Ezra.
*  I am on book leave this week, but we have the great trustee Macmillan Cottom sitting
*  in the chair.
*  She is a Times Opinion columnist.
*  She is the author of Lower Ed, The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy,
*  and the National Book Award nominee, Thicke.
*  She has been a guest on the show before, a host on the show before her episodes, no matter
*  where she is sitting, in which chair, are always some of my favorite.
*  So I'm excited to hear what she does this week, and I hope you enjoy it too.
*  And before we begin, one more thing today.
*  So I am doing the annual Jefferson Memorial Lecture for UC Berkeley, which I'm excited
*  about as a kid who grew up in California, idolizing and then getting repeatedly rejected
*  by UC Berkeley when I applied there.
*  And it's going to be the first time I try to work through the ideas of the book in public,
*  with an audience, in conversation with someone else who knows what they're talking about
*  on these issues, Amy Lerman in this case.
*  And if you'd like to join and hear what I've been thinking about, you can.
*  Tickets are available at calperformances.org.
*  We'll put the link to the event page in show notes.
*  And again, that is October 5th at UC Berkeley.
*  The library is as much an idea as it is a place.
*  It promises books, yes, but also services, access, and public infrastructure in an information-based
*  economy.
*  For a long time, the idea that we all generally want more of what the library offers has been
*  a taken-for-granted American value.
*  But recently, libraries have become a political lightning rod, where even the most basic assumption
*  of the value of this essential public good is now somehow controversial.
*  According to the American Library Association, last year there were 1,269 attempts to censor
*  what materials appeared in public libraries.
*  Across the nation, there are contentious debates raging over things like drag story
*  hours, children's programming, and even what books and programming should be available
*  for adults in public and school libraries.
*  Emily Drabinski is paying very close attention to these efforts to censor libraries.
*  She should be.
*  Drabinski is what you might call a librarian with a capital L. In 2022, she was elected
*  president of the American Library Association, a professional organization representing the
*  nation's librarians.
*  She also happens to be a queer person, a parent, a longtime librarian, and also in her academic
*  work, a scholar of critical librarianship.
*  I wanted to talk to Emily about the political and cultural anxieties fueling anti-library
*  sentiments across the United States and what it all says about the health of our body politic.
*  As always, the show's email is Ezra Klein Show at NYTimes.com.
*  Welcome Emily Drabinski to the show.
*  How are you today?
*  I'm good.
*  I'm having a good day and really excited to be here.
*  I've written that children are people who deserve private reading lives.
*  I think about that a lot, one, because I interact with a lot of young people and they certainly
*  think about their private lives.
*  I remember being a young person and being obsessed with having a private life.
*  Yet, when I look at how we got here and where we are now when it comes to the fight about
*  libraries and books and reading material, I don't hear a lot of the voice of young people
*  in the conversation about where we are now.
*  I wondered if you could tell me what you mean when you say children are people who deserve
*  private reading lives.
*  That's a big question.
*  I don't know how popular it is to think of kids in that way.
*  Since I became president of the American Library Association, I have spent so much time reading
*  through our documents, our policies, our position papers, our analyses.
*  One of the things that makes me quite proud is the commitment that we have to children
*  as people who can read.
*  I have a child of my own.
*  Everyone's like, parents should be able to control what their children read.
*  I'm like, do you have a child?
*  Have you met a child?
*  The degree of control you have over a child is more limited than I sometimes want.
*  I think it comes down to respect for individual people and their right to their own imagination
*  and the sovereignty of their own minds.
*  Attacks on libraries right now are shaped and framed as attacks on books, but I think
*  we all know there are attacks on people and attacks on children.
*  We hear less from the readers and the writers of these books than I think we need to.
*  I think a lot of parents would agree almost as an instinct or an impulse anyway.
*  They would agree strongly with the principle that children deserve private lives.
*  Like, of course, my child, they get their own room, for example.
*  Sure, they should have their privacy.
*  They get their inner world.
*  But I think they struggle with what that means in everyday practice, especially when it comes
*  to when they're looking at their own child and against the larger context of fear.
*  The world is this big, scary place.
*  I am their only defense.
*  Their last defense against everything, because that's kind of how we've painted modern parenthood.
*  So you mentioned you are a parent and you're a librarian, a kind of big librarian, the
*  sort of like capital L sense of librarian.
*  So do you have those competing impulses?
*  And if so, how do you navigate them as a parent and capital L librarian?
*  No, absolutely.
*  Like I said, I have a teenager.
*  My life is consumed with worry about him and his future.
*  And I worry for his world when he grows up and the world he's living in now and the constraints
*  on his imagination from all kinds of different directions.
*  And I also worry about his choices, you know.
*  Does he always make good choices?
*  Absolutely not.
*  I can confirm he made a bad one just today.
*  But I made some bad ones this week also.
*  So giving him the sort of grace to be a full person.
*  But when it comes to the media he consumes and the books that he reads, yeah, I mean,
*  I can't say it doesn't worry me.
*  But that struggle around the worry, that grappling with what I want for him and who he is and
*  who he wants to be and who I want him to be, that these are the conditions of loving other
*  people, of having children in our worlds, and there aren't easy answers for it.
*  I think that's one of the things that's surprising, the conviction some people have over what
*  is right for children.
*  I just, you know, I look at my kid and his struggles every day and one thing I'm not
*  as sure about a whole lot.
*  All right, so we'll come back to the tensions, by the way, between what parents might want
*  for their kids broadly and what they want for their own kids.
*  Because that is one of the fundamental tensions.
*  The idea that there's what I want for my kids and that gives me a sense of certainty that
*  I want to project out into the world.
*  I happen to think that's where a lot of the political and social conflict lies, as you
*  mentioned.
*  How can people feel so certain when you yourself as a parent is like, I'm riddled with uncertainty?
*  Just guessing every day.
*  Every day.
*  And I think a lot of parents are.
*  But let's talk a little bit more about your current role.
*  So you campaign to be the head of the American Library Association at a moment of great stress
*  and distress, I might say, for libraries and for the country more broadly.
*  And I think those two things are related.
*  So my first question is why?
*  Why did you campaign at this moment to head up the ALA?
*  I mean, why not me?
*  Why not me?
*  Okay.
*  I was like, no, let me just step in here and do this.
*  So I ran because I care a whole lot about libraries and I care a ton about library workers.
*  And I know what kind of stress we're under.
*  I see it in my colleagues.
*  I see it in the people that I talk to.
*  I've been a librarian for a long time.
*  I know librarians all over the country.
*  And there's not a one of them that feels secure in their ability to do the jobs that we want
*  to do.
*  And I thought that if I ran for president of the American Library Association, making
*  a public argument about the importance both of libraries as public institutions that secure
*  the public good and library workers as the people who are responsible for that and need
*  the kind of support to expand that work, that whatever happened, it would be good to
*  have that public argument out in the world.
*  What does it mean, by the way, for public libraries to be a model or an example of the
*  public good?
*  Because I tend to agree with you.
*  Just let me show my hand here, by the way.
*  I think it is one of the few places where people from multiple social classes still
*  have to interact with each other as we have retreated from each other in public life.
*  People can take their personal vehicles.
*  We don't have to interact with each other on public transportation.
*  We don't interact with each other in the same shopping.
*  But libraries are one of these places where we brush up against each other.
*  But like I say that, and even I can hear it to my own ears, it's like this highfalutin
*  idea.
*  And I'm always trying to make it really tangible for people.
*  What does it mean to you when you say, listen, the public library is a model, it is the public
*  good?
*  So I was in Des Moines, Iowa, touring a library, and they have a library of things, which many,
*  many public libraries have these days.
*  And they circulate book club kits and sensory kits for kids and science materials and cake
*  pans and tools.
*  This library had started circulating to carpet cleaning machines.
*  And I remember growing up in Boise, Idaho, my mother saving up for months to be able
*  to rent that carpet cleaner at the Albertsons in Boise, Idaho, so she could clean our carpets.
*  And this library takes that out of the equation.
*  And it means everybody can clean their carpet.
*  And it seems like a small thing.
*  It's like one thing happening in Des Moines, Iowa, but multiply that by the hundreds and
*  thousands of public libraries across the country.
*  And every single one of them has something like that, that's securing and expanding access
*  to public resources for everyone.
*  It doesn't matter who you are.
*  You can be anybody you walk in.
*  They did say there's a line, they have two of them, and they said the hold line for those
*  carpet cleaners is 45 people in line.
*  So you got to wait, which is a testament to how much people want access to those public
*  resources, how high the demand is when we make public goods available.
*  Not a small thing.
*  No, it is not.
*  Not a small thing at all.
*  And one of the things I love about working in libraries is that it's material, you know,
*  those highfalutin thoughts about the public good.
*  In the library, rubber meets the road just constantly.
*  Every day, it's a space where using the bathroom and getting a drink of water, like those are
*  public goods and we're the only people that offer them.
*  I think a lot about indoor space also.
*  Like the bigger the library, the more indoor space you have.
*  I was in Grimes, Iowa, and the library there had served a community for decades and never
*  gotten beyond its sort of one room size.
*  The library director was telling me over years of one-on-one conversations with the people
*  who were in the city council and the people who run the businesses in the small town in
*  Grimes eventually, after all that time, managed to secure 82% support from the community for
*  a new library that's four times the size.
*  And that means so much more space for people to come and meet and gather, so much more
*  room for books, so much more room for bathrooms.
*  It's brilliant and amazing and good and we want more of that.
*  Yeah.
*  This is really small infrastructure is basically what we're talking about.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, when we talk about infrastructure in this country, you know, we think bridges
*  and roads and those things are super important.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  But I got to think the small infrastructure matters a lot too.
*  And it's the kind of infrastructure that people don't think about needing until somebody says,
*  hey, could you use a carpet cleaner?
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  And then suddenly there are 45 people.
*  Think about what institutions are there that circulate things.
*  I think about that a lot, that like moving things around and sharing them.
*  Like you've got the post office and you have the library.
*  Those are the two kind of infrastructures that circulate goods and services among the
*  people and the library is like a place that does that and kind of the only one.
*  Yeah.
*  Not a surprise, by the way, that you just mentioned two institutions that have each
*  faced a political uphill battle for capital and relevancy over the last 20 years.
*  The post office facing its own set of challenges and the idea of the library facing its own
*  and both, as you point out, really important to circulating the things that people need.
*  Should there be an afterlife?
*  If I get there, I want it written in the big book that I loved libraries.
*  But there is such a thing.
*  I know that you can love something and want it to be better and that that can be an act
*  of love and service.
*  You have spent a lot of your scholarly work on critical librarianship.
*  I think this would surprise people, first of all, that there is a robust field called
*  critical librarianship.
*  There is.
*  Quite robust.
*  There are lots of us.
*  Yep.
*  In fact, the librarians that I have had the great fortune to hang out with over the years,
*  almost all critical librarians.
*  Oh yeah.
*  There are a bunch of us.
*  So what is critical librarianship?
*  Tell us what that is.
*  You know, it's like anything.
*  There are a million definitions and who you ask will tell you something different.
*  I think of critical librarianship as taking a critical view of the systems and structures
*  that produce the library as we know it and experience it and think about ways that that
*  library could be different.
*  So I've done most of that work around cataloging and classification and thinking about the
*  language that we use to describe things and thinking about the order in which we put things.
*  And so you go into a library and you think the books are just arranged in Dewey Decimal
*  Order and that's kind of annoying, but whatever.
*  But critical librarianship takes an interest in what that knowledge organization system,
*  what the story it tells about itself through the ordering mechanism.
*  You have written that one of the insights of critical librarianship since the 1970s
*  has been this acknowledgement that invisible intellectual structures actually have a relationship
*  to the material world of knowledge construction.
*  Something's happening in there.
*  You go in there and like you say, you just go, oh, hey, look, this book comes before that book.
*  So what's happening when that book goes before that book?
*  Why does that matter?
*  So everything for me comes from my own experience of the world.
*  So I got a job.
*  My first college library job was at Sarah Lawrence College.
*  And I came to that library as it was finishing a major shift.
*  And like if you're a librarian and you've worked on a major shift of the collection,
*  shouts to you, I hope we never have to do it again because you've got to take all the books,
*  you've got to put them somewhere and move them around.
*  And so I was working on shelving the sort of last sets of those books.
*  And we had a copy of Christine Jorgensen's autobiography, a memoir of a trans woman
*  published I think in the 1960s.
*  And that book was downstairs in the basement in the R section,
*  which is the section for mental illness, psychiatric diseases.
*  We had a second copy of that book that was with a historicizing introduction.
*  And it was on the third floor in the HQs, which is where we shelved social problems.
*  And I was struck by the distance between those books, right?
*  And they tell you that one of the books is that gender is a problem in your brain.
*  And the other one is gender is a social construction that is malleable.
*  And the distance between those says something.
*  And the elevator was slow.
*  And so the physical distance was really real.
*  You had to walk up all these stairs to get to the two books and put them together.
*  And so the context of where the book sits is consequential for the meaning we can make from it.
*  You know, I was thinking many of us encounter, quote, unquote,
*  the catalog is just the card catalog.
*  But you're saying it's more than just this accessible, lowly,
*  practical way to find a book or a resource.
*  Basically, what you just described to me, you know, the catalog is power.
*  Like there's a lot of power in where the books are placed and how.
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Absolutely.
*  I'm working on an oral history project with a colleague right now,
*  and we're recording oral histories of people who have developed alternate classification schemes.
*  And we were recording with a couple of librarians who were part of developing
*  the Chicano thesaurus for Chicano movement materials.
*  And the way they talk about that experience of trying to find information about themselves
*  and their experience in the Berkeley library, say, and just the absence of it completely,
*  the inability to find anything.
*  You know, they threw themselves into making this index because there was no other way
*  for them to organize information about their experience.
*  Like they had to.
*  So like I think if you don't see yourself in the catalog, which is like a ton of us,
*  it's pretty clear and it's pretty problematic.
*  TAMARA KEITH I've got to talk about though why this may have come to a head
*  when you were finally elected April 2022.
*  Other people then were surprised.
*  They don't know what critical librarianship is.
*  You write a tweet that says, hey, I cannot believe that a Marxist lesbian who believes
*  that collective power is possible to build and can be wielded for a better world
*  is the president-elect of ALA library.
*  You know, it was an excited utterance.
*  TAMARA KEITH Right.
*  There was a lot of backlash.
*  Okay.
*  So some Republicans accused the ALA of being suddenly a radical leftist organization.
*  To be fair, they now accuse everything of being a radical leftist organization.
*  But I do think this was a new experience for the American Library Association.
*  The Montana State Library cut ties with the ALA.
*  Lawmakers in states like Wyoming, Georgia, and Mississippi pushed to do the same.
*  We can get into the political mudslinging, but how unprecedented is this?
*  TAMARA KEITH This is unprecedented and it is extraordinarily painful.
*  The attacks on libraries and individual librarians, to see those intensify
*  and to see those attacks be directed at institutions that would protect them,
*  that represent them, that they are a part of.
*  The American Library Association, we run right around 50,000 members and each one of those people
*  is committed totally to the project of expanding access to information for everyone.
*  To have this politicization of our role get in the way of that work, for me, is the most painful
*  part of this experience.
*  Wish I could go back in time and push that tweet right back in the bottle because it was an excited
*  utterance for me and my friends.
*  To forget for a moment that I was in the public square was regrettable.
*  TAMARA KEITH Yeah.
*  Yeah, I'm just a person.
*  I got a kid in high school.
*  I'm worried about him.
*  It's been tough and I think all I want to do is make good on the promise of the ALA for American
*  librarians and the communities we serve.
*  To have this stand in the way of that has been a devastation for sure.
*  TAMARA KEITH Yeah.
*  What do you think it is about the American Library Association and librarians in this
*  moment that feels like an acceptable target for this political discourse?
*  You represent something clearly.
*  What is it that makes you both vulnerable?
*  I think we can kind of, you know, under-resourced, sure, not much of a political defense.
*  I think we can see maybe the vulnerabilities, but such a rich target, like what is it that
*  is being projected on the ALA and on librarianship in particular, you think?
*  TAMARA KEITH You know, it's very confusing to me because the vast majority of people
*  love the library.
*  Survey after survey, like poll after poll.
*  Nobody wants what's happening right now.
*  Nobody wants this.
*  The Michigan Library Association ran a poll recently that 78% of their respondents said
*  they didn't want restrictions on reading materials and they wanted to have the right to sort of
*  guide their children's reading rather than ceding that to a handful of people.
*  The ALA's polls are similar.
*  Our Unite Against Book Bans campaign surveyed the public, you know, across section, across
*  the political spectrum, and the vast majority of people, again, really want libraries and want
*  libraries to be available and accessible to everyone.
*  So, you know, I think that's part of what's confusing to me is like, it's a small and
*  vocal minority that somehow has the power to shape the narrative about American libraries right now.
*  And how they got power is the thing that I find really confusing and the thing that I really
*  puzzle over.
*  But I think the part that we were talking about earlier, that libraries are
*  public institutions that are about expanding access to public resources, that we are sharing
*  institutions, that we want to take resources that are held in common and distribute them
*  equitably among everyone.
*  I mean, that idea is, I think, the thing that's most under threat right now.
*  So there is a perspective that could say we agree on one thing, right?
*  The critics and critical librarians agree that the library is powerful.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Just perhaps disagree on how the power should work.
*  Does that seem fair?
*  That seems fair.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So let me put something really controversial before you.
*  Okay.
*  Can a library ever be politically neutral?
*  Yeah, I mean, this is a question, right?
*  So libraries, what do we do?
*  We provide essential information and services to the public.
*  And we are intended to be valued pillars of our community.
*  That's what we're for.
*  And we're not politically biased organizations.
*  That's not what we do.
*  This is not normal, I think, to be embroiled in this kind of a political fight.
*  And so neutral is a thing that we, I think, many times strive for.
*  Like, neutral meaning we want everybody to be able to come in and we want something in
*  our collections for everyone.
*  But it's hard at this moment when intellectual freedom and the right to read are under siege.
*  It's hard to imagine a modern library as a neutral bystander.
*  Let's talk about book challenges.
*  The American Library Association has an office that tracks reports of book challenges.
*  In 2022, that office received a record 1,269 challenges, which is the most on record.
*  That's nearly double the 729 challenges reported in 2021.
*  What patterns are we seeing in these challenges?
*  There are all the patterns that you would guess that you probably don't need me to say.
*  But I think it's important to say it again and again.
*  These books are books that tell stories about certain kinds of lives and experiences.
*  The lives and experiences of Black people, the lives and experiences of LGBTQ
*  plus people, the lives and experiences of people of color.
*  The attacks are on those kinds of stories.
*  Books that are about you and about me.
*  All right.
*  We know not only that the books are disproportionately written by or about
*  members of the LGBTQIA plus community or by and about Black people, Indigenous people,
*  and people of color, but recent research is also showing that they seem to be like the
*  same titles over and over again, showing perhaps a pattern of identifying the same
*  sort of books and authors over and over again.
*  There's a list.
*  Yeah.
*  On the ALA's list of most challenged books in 2022, four of the top five feature queer
*  characters, and that's a pretty consistent pattern going back several years.
*  And then we sort of start to see a shift over the last few years to stories featuring more
*  trans characters.
*  That coincides with the flood of bills, of course, restricting gender affirming care
*  for minors.
*  So you see this intersection of the change in political narratives with books that are
*  being targeted.
*  So none of this is happening in isolation, obviously.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, if we define the problem as simply one banned book, the solution is put that
*  book back on the shelf.
*  So I think it's really important to think about the problem more expansively as you're
*  describing it.
*  And so what would it mean to think beyond that solution of put the book back on the
*  shelf?
*  What is the larger, if it is larger than that, how do we need to think instead of just
*  going to then saying, hey, no, not those books, you know, showing up at my local library,
*  meaning, hey, not those books.
*  What would it mean for me to argue more broadly?
*  I think a couple things like it's not just not those books, it's not those people.
*  Right?
*  That's the link that I see when you're describing the sort of anti-trans laws, which
*  are about not wanting trans people in the world.
*  There was a recent study that came out looking at the status of like queer kids and queer
*  books and queer school libraries.
*  And 90% of the respondents said one of the places they feel safe at school is their
*  school library.
*  So there's that piece.
*  And then I think the other piece is thinking about like the ban on the book.
*  It's also a ban on the library and wanting the library to disappear.
*  So we're seeing in some of the attacks, like if the books aren't banned or they're banned
*  in a way that we don't want or not enough or not whatever, like it's hard to even know,
*  you know, it seems like it doesn't have a whole lot to do actually with what the library
*  engages or reacts.
*  But another, the next sort of next step is to defund the library altogether and eliminate
*  it.
*  And we see this in Michigan, it happened in Northern Idaho, it's happened in states that
*  are withdrawing their support from ALA, right?
*  Part of the project is to dismantle these institutions, period.
*  And so for all the reasons that we just talked about, about how libraries are amazing,
*  community, anchor institutions, efforts to dismantle them and disappear them, that seems
*  part of the end game as well.
*  It reminds me so much what you just described.
*  I just had this sort of shiver because it reminds me so much of the massive resistance
*  response to school desegregation, which is if we have to allow one black child, we'd
*  rather there be no school at all.
*  We'll fill the swimming pool with concrete.
*  That's right.
*  Which always suggests that this is about some larger idea about who is included in
*  the political project for whom the legal provisions will acknowledge.
*  So not those books, not those people.
*  You made me think about something that I think I've heard some people kind of say, not in
*  a way, but just sort of like a shrugging off about when a library closes what the real
*  impact is.
*  And that is because I think we have sometimes a latent assumption, even if we haven't
*  thought it affirmatively, that, well, you have the internet, right?
*  Well, maybe you do.
*  Oh, okay.
*  You know, like maybe you have it.
*  Right.
*  What is the impact when a book isn't available in a library or a library isn't available
*  in a school or a library isn't available in a community when we have the presumption that
*  especially a vulnerable minority group or person can just find their people or find
*  their material or find what they need in the safety and anonymity of online communities
*  and materials?
*  It's just there's a really big difference, right, between Googling it and having access
*  to literature and imagination and what other institution is there that exists that can
*  give you both the technological infrastructure, right, like the computer and the internet,
*  but also like the person who will help you.
*  And so when the library disappears, it's not just the book, it's not just that, but it's
*  like everything that that library can do for the people in the community.
*  And I think sometimes when people are like, well, who needs a library?
*  You can just go on Amazon.
*  They're not remembering that not everyone lives a life like ours, which I think is another
*  like sort of poverty of the imagination in this country sometimes, which is like, we don't
*  imagine that anybody lives a life where they don't have a laptop.
*  You know, we forget.
*  And so when people say we don't need a library, I'm like, have you ever been to a library?
*  Like, you know, when I worked at the public library, the line for the computers would be
*  20 people long before we opened the door all day long.
*  They're such busy places.
*  That's what I think people forget that like the people who use the library a lot, they
*  are also people who deserve the state to provide for some of their needs.
*  I like to say to my very well-to-do friends sometimes about the library and one of its
*  most basic functions, as you have so eloquently described, is that, oh, they do for people what
*  you do for your elderly parents.
*  Exactly.
*  If you've ever walked your elderly parents through their technology problem, thank a
*  librarian.
*  They are doing that for people all day long with much higher stakes.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah, it's eviction as opposed to, you know, I don't know, my mom can't get her Kindle
*  book.
*  You go.
*  Which is a problem.
*  It is a certain type of a problem.
*  Yeah.
*  It is.
*  You are right.
*  It is a category of a problem that my mother also shares.
*  I just finally canceled the Kindle.
*  I couldn't.
*  We got rid of the Kindle.
*  We got rid of the smartphone.
*  We're like, you know, these aren't necessary things.
*  But you know what I'll say about my mom is she goes once a week on Wednesdays to the
*  Boise Public Library.
*  That's right.
*  She checks out seven books.
*  She goes home.
*  The following Wednesday, she goes, she returns those seven books and checks out seven more
*  books.
*  My mom does the same thing with her audiobooks on cassette and CD.
*  And it's been a godsend.
*  Yeah.
*  Because material culture, she can still work it.
*  She can keep track of it.
*  The problem with the digital downloads is that she couldn't touch it.
*  Yeah.
*  Where is it?
*  Where is it?
*  That's right.
*  And I couldn't get her over that sort of cognitive leap.
*  You know, the best thing about being ALA president is I get to visit so many libraries
*  and I've visited so many libraries and they're all amazing.
*  And some of them have phased out those collections entirely and others have, like I was at a ski
*  resort with my family last Christmas.
*  And the ski resort library has like a vast collection of DVDs, which a lot of libraries
*  have gotten rid of because you can stream things.
*  But the community there, they have a lot of people who work at the resort and live in
*  their vans and they don't have the internet in their van.
*  And so they have a way to check out a VCR and a video so you can watch the video.
*  And it's like, libraries meet the needs of their communities.
*  I'm not sure people know how libraries acquire their stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  I think this is really important because my sense in the debate and the fights,
*  I should just let me just speak just very plainly, the fights over book bands and information
*  bands and libraries assumes that there is just this sort of, you know, materials are
*  being selected by fiat by some authority on high.
*  But what you have just described, there is a lot of negotiation between community needs
*  and the materials that circulate in a library.
*  How are books, like how do books get into the library?
*  They're born there actually.
*  I thought so.
*  Yeah.
*  It's interesting because I'm really interested in the back end of things, right?
*  Like the sort of how's the back infrastructure working, you know, like how the books and they
*  are selected and acquired by professionals who have training in collection development.
*  Can you believe that?
*  No.
*  It's an actual job that a human does.
*  So you're saying this is not AI?
*  This is not AI.
*  Okay.
*  That's not to say that there aren't sort of subscription plans and selection lists
*  and sort of things that make it easier to buy books for your collection.
*  But think about it, you know, there's so much opposition to school libraries and what they
*  have on their collections.
*  Like that's really where a lot of this fight is happening is like at the school library.
*  And the school librarian, all they do all day is like think about the kids in the school
*  and look at the curriculum and select books that meet the needs of the curriculum.
*  It's like none of it, none of the books arrived by accident.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  And there exist already these mechanisms, right, for people to nominate the books or
*  ask for books or suggest the books.
*  And I think that's one of the things about this sort of the book challenge conversation
*  right now.
*  It's not as if libraries don't want community members to engage with us about what we have,
*  make suggestions, even express concerns.
*  It's the sort of bad faith, many, many book challenges, the challenges of books I haven't
*  even read kinds of things that are problematic.
*  You pointed out something that I wanted to kind of put a finer point on that so much
*  of this has focused on school libraries and school libraries and public libraries are
*  being targeted at we think roughly equal rates.
*  But is there a meaningful difference between trying to remove a book from a school library
*  and trying to remove one from a public library?
*  Oh, that's a good question.
*  I think school libraries function a little differently for their patrons, right?
*  Like we were talking about the school library is like the place.
*  I don't know.
*  I ate my lunch there every day in the seventh grade.
*  They're homes for kids in a different way.
*  My kid went to a middle school that didn't have a school library.
*  There was a public library across the street.
*  Guess how many times he went to the public library?
*  Zero times.
*  So that he didn't have that sort of center of gravity of the collection.
*  That's in a school library.
*  And when there are efforts to remove books from the school library, that's a direct
*  attack on the fabric of that community.
*  And the public library functions similarly, I think.
*  But there's something quite special about the school library as the sort of heart of
*  a kid's life.
*  Because for a kid, the school is their whole planet.
*  There's no other real world for a kid in a lot of ways.
*  Their world is at school.
*  And so removing a book from the school library, it's like removing it from their entire world.
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Right.
*  When you take a book out of a school library, you really do pull it out of a child, a young
*  person's whole sort of ecosystem in a way.
*  And it gets me to thinking about what a library encompasses.
*  So a library has this market element.
*  It does allow certain transactions.
*  It circulates things.
*  But as we've discussed, there's also this democratic element.
*  It does this in a way that is more about sharing than it is about competition for goods and
*  for resources.
*  So there's a market element because it's demand for certain kinds of books.
*  And that certainly matters.
*  You want things that people want, but you want people's voices to be heard.
*  You want to serve the needs of a community.
*  Even if there are only a few people in that community, you still want them to have some
*  stuff that they need.
*  So that's what that sounds about, right?
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm a member of a book club, and we read 50 books a year in 50 categories.
*  And we've got the categories, and then you choose a book that fits in each category.
*  And it has really opened up my reading.
*  And I now read a whole lot of books in translation, which I never did before.
*  And so I read books from all kinds of different parts of the world.
*  And it's true what they say about a book.
*  It opens your imagination and makes the world wider.
*  And I'm a big reader, you know?
*  But there are books I read now that I would never have read before.
*  Like I read Paris Hilton's memoir this year.
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Oh, wow.
*  LESLIE KENDRICK I had to read a book that is coming out and has a lot of buzz.
*  And so that was the category.
*  So I read Paris Hilton's memoir.
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Oh, wow.
*  LESLIE KENDRICK And it's not a book that I thought I would read, but I read it.
*  And it opened my mind a little bit and made me think in new ways.
*  And it was good.
*  And I'm glad we had it.
*  But I wonder if that's what some of the hostility is, right?
*  That we want…
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Ah.
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Like it's difficult to imagine
*  supporting something that was for everybody.
*  Like even people I really don't agree with.
*  So as many people as like are mad at me for being who I am.
*  Like there are lots of people that I don't agree with.
*  But I still think that they have a right to read a book, you know?
*  I don't know.
*  But then you think about like what makes a social program successful.
*  It's that everybody's in it.
*  Like social security is durable because all of us use it.
*  So when people say the library is vulnerable, I actually think it's interesting how durable
*  it has been.
*  How this moment is unprecedented.
*  We haven't faced what say public education has faced.
*  Because it's difficult to imagine privatizing the library, right?
*  You couldn't do it.
*  I couldn't own every book in my house.
*  I don't want to own Paris Hilton's memoir.
*  I want to read it and then return it.
*  So someone else can read it, right?
*  So it's actually surprising to me, I guess, in some ways that this institution that does
*  so much to provide equal access to literally everyone in a community.
*  I think that is kind of the key to its durability as a social institution.
*  Hmm.
*  You said in an interview that you don't want the library to get stuck talking exclusively
*  on the terms they have set for us rather than the terms that I think the rest of us operate
*  on every day.
*  What are the terms of the debate that you wish we were using?
*  I wish we were spending less time talking about the book banning stuff.
*  I wish we were having a conversation about how to expand libraries.
*  That we were talking about what good they do.
*  That we were talking about not just the carpet cleaners in Des Moines, but the cotton candy
*  machine they circulate at the Donnelly Public Library in Donnelly, Idaho to make birthday
*  parties in that rural part of the state a little more fun for kids.
*  That we were talking about how to get more cotton candy machines.
*  And every library I go to has something else like that.
*  I just got back from Rotterdam where I was at the International Federation of Library
*  Associations and was going through the poster sessions and saw this library in Romania
*  where they had a program that connected elders who were some of the last in the community
*  to know the sort of lost art of embroidering shirts in this particular Romanian way with
*  young people who learned how to do the embroidery but then also digitized the patterns so that they
*  can be preserved forever. And then they both made the shirt and wore it at a library program.
*  You know, it's like that's magic. So I wish we were talking about like more about what that
*  means for a community, what it means for the history of the place, the future of the place,
*  for just that basic human connection that we miss sometimes. What do we have to do to get more of
*  that rather than trying to defend what little we have left of what I would argue is the best public
*  institution in the history of the world, the library? We ask all guests on the show for three
*  book recommendations and I cannot think of anyone better to ask this of. Not only are you a librarian
*  capital L but you just admitted to being in the most aggressive sounding book club I have ever heard
*  of in my life. You know what, if you win the challenge at the end of the year, you know what
*  your prize is? What? You get to invite a new person to join the club.
*  I was kind of hoping you were going to say a gold sticker. Which so trust me if you're interested,
*  I'll keep you in mind. It's a big year for me but I still think I'm going to do it.
*  All right, keep me in mind. I write. Okay. Until then, do you have three books for us, Emily?
*  The first book that I want to suggest is a book about libraries that I think is just fantastic
*  by Dan Green called The Promise of Access. He's got a chapter about the library that just
*  is some of the most solid analysis of what libraries can do and how we need to talk about
*  them. I would recommend Dan Green's book. The second is a book that's on the list of the top
*  10 banned books from the ALA called Flamer by Mike Corrado. It's a book about a kid at sleepaway
*  camp. I read it this summer when my kid was at sleepaway camp. You read it and what we're
*  talking about, do they want to ban the book or do they want to ban the person? You read this
*  beautiful tender story of a kid struggling with his sexual identity at a boy scout camp. It's so
*  beautiful and sweet and gorgeous. Just a perfect graphic novel, I think. Very sweet. Then the last
*  recommendation, have you read When We Were Beautiful by Imbolo Mbuye? Yes, I have. Oh,
*  knocked my socks off. The best book I've read this year, the first chapter of that book
*  should be required reading. Amazing recommendations. Thank you. Emily,
*  thank you for joining me here today. I appreciate the conversation. Thank you so much.
