# Best Of: The War Within the Republican Party
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [April 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIB8bFVqxeQ)
*  I'm Ezra Klein.
*  This is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Let me state the question of this episode clearly.
*  What the hell has happened to the Republican Party?
*  When I began covering politics 20ish years ago, the clich√© was that Democrats were this
*  barely organized collection of squabbling interest groups, barely a party.
*  But Republicans, Republicans were this disciplined, ideological, unified political force.
*  Their majority leader at the time, Tom DeLay, he had the nickname The Hammer.
*  If that was ever true, it's not now.
*  Democrats have become a pretty organized party.
*  Their leadership transitions are orderly.
*  They tend to fall in line.
*  They nominate the next in line.
*  Republicans are a mess.
*  Watching Kevin McCarthy suffer through 14 failed votes to win the speakership, trading
*  away his own power, his potential job security, and really crucially, the aura of influence
*  and prestige that a speaker needs to be successful.
*  I mean, I'm no Kevin McCarthy fan, but even I felt bad for the guy.
*  And this was being inflicted on him by his own co-partisans.
*  It wasn't some plot Democrats executed against him.
*  The Republican tendency to obstruct, to sabotage, to throw sand in the gears, it is as powerful
*  when they are in charge as when they're in the minority.
*  Because look back over the past decade or so, it's not just Kevin McCarthy.
*  It's Paul Ryan and John Boehner who both quit the job McCarthy now holds because it was
*  so miserable.
*  It's the Tea Party knocking off Republican incumbent after Republican incumbent, including
*  members of leadership like Eric Cantor, who is majority leader and was thought to be a
*  future speaker.
*  It's Ted Cruz and the Freedom Caucus forcing government shutdowns our colleagues hated
*  and opposed.
*  It's Donald Trump humiliating almost the entire Republican Party establishment, but winning
*  the nomination anyway, proving that whatever the Republican Party now is, whatever the
*  coalition now is, he understood it much better than the politicians who'd let it.
*  Republicans aren't a party anymore.
*  They're a riot, a movement, but they're one that is often at war with itself.
*  And that's not normal.
*  All political parties, they have internal dissent and conflict.
*  What is distinctive about Republicans in this era is they have lost control.
*  I date that to around 2010 with rise of the Tea Party, but that's just the moment the
*  dynamics of the party tipped out of balance.
*  It's not the moment those dynamics began.
*  So when did they begin and why?
*  Who profits from this version of the Republican Party?
*  Who perpetuates it?
*  Nicole Hemmer is a historian at Vanderbilt who studies the Republican Party and she studies
*  it particularly through the lens of its media.
*  She's the author of two great books about the conservative movement, Messengers of the
*  Right and Her New Unpartisans, which I highly recommend.
*  And she's a perfect person for this conversation.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at nytimes.com.
*  Nicole Hemmer, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks for having me, Ezra.
*  So something I was thinking about during the whole Kevin McCarthy contra-tempts was this
*  old cliche that I used to hear when I started covering politics, which is Democrats fall
*  in love, Republicans fall in line.
*  And there were a bunch of ideas like this.
*  The old Will Rogers quote, I don't belong to an organized political party, I'm a Democrat.
*  There was this idea that Democrats were this fractious, barely held together coalition
*  of interest groups and Republicans were this more organized, cohesive, ideologically unified
*  political party.
*  Let me begin with asking you as a historian, was that ever true?
*  I think it was true for a brief moment in time.
*  And even then it was only kind of true, in part because the Republican Party doesn't
*  become more ideologically homogenous until you get really into the 1970s and 1980s, you
*  know, in the Reagan era, you have this big landslide election time after time, and you
*  have Reagan pronouncing what he called at the time the 11th commandment, that thou shall
*  not attack other Republicans.
*  So there was this real sense of the party and the movement have come into power.
*  We have our chance.
*  Let's get on the same page.
*  And there were definitely folks who were disappointed with Reagan, who were further to the right
*  than Reagan and were battling against him.
*  But their complaints tended to get kind of muted in that rosy glow of the Reagan era
*  for the right.
*  But ever since then, it doesn't sound like a very accurate description of the Republican
*  Party, especially since we're talking about the House.
*  Ever since Republicans gained power in the House of Representatives for the first time
*  in four decades when they come to power in 1995, there have been these fractious battles
*  happening within the Republican conference between the leadership and the folks who are
*  further to the right and see themselves as the most conservative and the most ideologically
*  true. So that has been a pattern really for at least the last 25, 30 years.
*  So it might be time to retire some of those those old sayings.
*  I want to zoom in on that period in 95 because I want to look at this way, this recurrent
*  cycle of each new Republican majority or generation basically beheading the congressional leadership
*  of the last one.
*  So Republicans come to power in 95 when they take power in the House for the first time
*  in many decades, they do so mostly under the leadership of Newt Gingrich, who becomes speaker.
*  But to get to that point, Newt Gingrich, among other things, leads an internal revolt against
*  more old line House Republicans against his own president in George H.W. Bush.
*  Tell me a bit about Newt Gingrich's path to power.
*  Newt Gingrich is such a fascinating political figure.
*  You know, he's actually a PhD in history.
*  He was a history professor in Georgia in the late 1970s, and he runs for Congress and he's
*  a backbencher, right? He's this guy from Georgia and he has his sights set on remaking the
*  Republican Party. He's just full of policy ideas and he's full of political tactics that
*  he wants to roll out. And he has his eye on power, which is an odd thing for a backbencher
*  in a party that has been in the minority for decades to aspire to. And yet he does.
*  And he sort of methodically makes his way up the ranks. He builds the conservative
*  opportunity society and is associated with something called the GOPAC, the GOP Political
*  Action Committee. So he starts to build institutions within the Republican Party.
*  He helps to lead ethics charges against a very powerful Democrat in the late 1980s, Jim Wright,
*  and manages to topple him. So he gets a little bit of a political victory under his belt against
*  the Democrats. But then, as you note, his path to power from then on out is through Republicans.
*  He works very closely with the Bush administration on working on the 1990 budget deal. This is the
*  budget deal that is going to raise taxes and it is going to break Bush's read my lips, no new taxes
*  pledge. And at the very last minute when Bush is going out to the Rose Garden to announce this
*  budget plan, Gingrich, who is supposed to be out there with him, be part of this photo opportunity,
*  veers off and goes to the cameras and attacks the plan. And that really is the moment when you see
*  that Gingrich is going to take on his own party in order to find a path to the speakership. And
*  that's a path that he ultimately manages to create by 1995. So you're a, I guess I've already said,
*  you're a historian, but I want to ask you a meta-historical question here. Because I have read
*  a dozen books about the great man of history theory of Newt Gingrich and how he puts American
*  politics on an entirely new path. And I'm always a little uncertain if I buy it in the sense that
*  there have now been so many Newt Gingrich like figures that have risen to prominence in the
*  Republican party. And there have been a number who tried this in the Democratic party and basically
*  got nowhere. That one thing I often wonder is whether or not the Republican base was simply
*  waiting for this figure. And yes, Newt Gingrich was the one who appeared at that moment. But if
*  it wasn't him, it would have soon been someone else because this is what the party had become.
*  They were looking for these insurgent, counter-establishment, culture war-like
*  figures. I mean, Pat Buchanan is in the same era. Rush Limbaugh is in the same era. And so as much
*  as Newt has his singular dimensions, that the focus on him, the idea that it could have been
*  that different isn't really that true. And you know that because repeatedly, Republicans have found
*  other figures like this going all the way, of course, now to Donald Trump to support.
*  LWK Gingrich was an innovator. And he was somebody who showed a path forward for
*  conservatives and Republicans who came after him. But you're absolutely right that he was
*  leaning into a moment. Certainly, Pat Buchanan's 1992 run showed that there was real discontent
*  with the Republican establishment. And that's actually important because if you're talking
*  about, say, the 1960s and 1970s, there isn't much of a conservative establishment to be upset with
*  in the Republican Party. It really takes those massive victories by Ronald Reagan and George
*  H.W. Bush, all that institution building for think tanks in order for there to be a kind of
*  robust conservative Republican establishment to push back against. And Pat Buchanan pushes back
*  against it. Rush Limbaugh pushes back against it on his radio show. He supports Pat Buchanan
*  in the primaries in 1992, which elevates his reputation as a kingmaker and as somebody who
*  is the voice of the base. And that really is a moment when you're starting to
*  see a distance between the conservative base and what it wants and these Republican presidents
*  and Republican leaders. And so Gingrich is absolutely reading the tea leaves in many ways.
*  We tell the story of Newt Gingrich as radicalizing the Republican Party, moving it to the right.
*  But that's a kind of flat picture of Newt Gingrich because he was also looking around and saying,
*  it's not just Pat Buchanan, it's Ross Perot, who was the third party challenger in the 1992 and
*  1996 elections and attracted a significant number of votes and reflected this sense that
*  American voters were really frustrated with the system as it was. And Gingrich compromises a lot
*  on conservative ideology in order to try to attract some of those Perot voters into the
*  Republican camp. So he's a savvy political figure, but he's also kind of a bridge figure
*  to the Tea Party caucus and to some of the House Freedom caucus that we see today.
*  1992 is so extraordinary to me. It's one of these moments where
*  the entire egg that is a Republican Party just seems to me to be hatching.
*  Yes.
*  Because you have Buchanan, you have Limbaugh, you have Newt, you have Perot. But I want to go back
*  to something you mentioned, which is this moment where Rush Limbaugh endorses Pat Buchanan.
*  And the George H.W. Bush White House has, I think, a fairly extraordinary response to that.
*  Can you talk through that story?
*  Absolutely. So the Bush administration is looking out over the political landscape in 1992. The
*  threat from Pat Buchanan is much larger than they thought that it would be. Buchanan, even though
*  he loses the New Hampshire primary to Bush by like 16 points, he got a lot closer than any of the
*  people in the Bush White House were comfortable with. And as they were surveying the sources of
*  Buchanan's popularity, they lit upon Rush Limbaugh, who by 1991-92 was a juggernaut in right-wing
*  media. He was something that no one had ever seen before. He was making millions of dollars. He had
*  millions of listeners. He was about to launch a new television show. He had best-selling books.
*  He was this very singular figure, and nobody knew how much influence he might have on the
*  conservative base. But what the Bush administration knew was that Limbaugh liked Buchanan, and Buchanan
*  was doing better than expected, and so they needed to harness some of that Limbaugh energy. And so in
*  order to do that, they tap the person who is going to be Limbaugh's television producer, and who has
*  been a consultant to the Republican Party and to several Republican presidents, Roger Ailes. And
*  they invite Roger Ailes, who had later become one of the founders of Fox News, they invite Roger Ailes
*  and Rush Limbaugh to the White House to have a night at the Kennedy Center with George and Barbara
*  Bush to stay over at the Lincoln bedroom and really to court him. And there is this one moment
*  that Rush Limbaugh will talk about for the next 30 years, where President Bush picks up his bag
*  and carries it in. And in many ways, Limbaugh latches onto that moment, not as Bush being this
*  generous blue-blooded wasp from New England, but as the president carried my bags. I have the power
*  in this situation. The president waits on me. And that dynamic is going to define a lot of Limbaugh's
*  career, but also is pointing to some things that are shifting within the conservative movement
*  and the Republican Party, where candidates and presidents are becoming more reliant on the
*  conservative media systems that people like Rush Limbaugh are building.
*  It makes me think of a legislative fight I covered in 2007, I think it was, where George W. Bush,
*  George H.W. Bush's son, was pushing an immigration reform bill. And this was a priority for him.
*  It was part of him and Karl Rove trying to build this enduring Republican majority.
*  It was a priority for the business wing of the Republican Party. It was championed in the Senate
*  by among others, John McCain. And I think the expectation, I think it's fair to say,
*  in politics was that it was going to pass. It was going to pass. And then there is this
*  massive revolt that emerges, and it is centered in talk radio. There are these studies that come out
*  later about just how much of its time conservative talk radio was spending on this bill. And talk
*  radio actually manages to turn enough Senate Republicans and House Republicans and Republican
*  elites against a bill that it dies. This signature initiative of a Republican president is killed by
*  the Republicans, not primarily by the Democrats. And I think you just begin to see this over and
*  over again, that Republican media, because in some ways, and we can get to this, it's a truer voice
*  of the Republican grassroots than the Republican Party is, it can actually beat the Republican
*  establishment. And it does. And every time it does it, it becomes more powerful and more able to do
*  it again. And I can't think of very analogous examples on the left. A lot of your work is on
*  Republican media. So why is it so powerful vis-a-vis the Republican establishment?
*  LWK It's a great question, because I think this is one of those codes that the left has been trying
*  to crack for a long time now, because they see the power of conservative media to pull the party to
*  the right. And they wonder why there isn't something equivalent on the left. You know,
*  the answer is complicated. In part, it is that from pretty much the very beginning of the Cold
*  War conservative movement, so as early as the 1940s and 1950s, conservative activists were turning to
*  media, whether it was publications like National Review, or radio shows like The Manion Forum or
*  the Dan Smute Report, they were turning to media to affect political change. They believed that
*  messaging and ideology came packaged together. And if you could just get it in front of enough
*  people through magazines, through radio, through television, that you would be able to build a
*  sizable movement that could affect political change. So there's a history of conservatives
*  building their own media and of conservative Americans listening to conservative media as
*  part of their conservative identity. And a lot of this happens because there's this very robust
*  media criticism at the heart of the conservative movement that the existing media, so whether it's
*  you know, New Yorker magazine, or CBS News or what have you, the New York Times, that existing media
*  aren't actually neutral and objective, that they're biased toward liberalism. And since you're
*  engaging and reading and listening to biased media, you should be listening to media that's biased
*  towards conservatism because those are the right values. And so that is important because by the
*  time you get to the 1980s and 1990s, by the time you get to Rush Limbaugh, part of being a conservative
*  in the United States really is consuming conservative media. And there's not an analogous
*  movement like that or a way of thinking about politics and media on the left, certainly not
*  among liberal democrats. So that's part of the reason. And then these institutions, these media
*  institutions, they're not just spreading messages, but also from pretty early on, they're getting
*  involved in politics. So that idea that media and politics are intertwined, not just on a messaging
*  level, but really on an institutional and structural level is something that on the right
*  has just, it now has, gosh, what, like a 70 year history? That's a lot of institution building.
*  That's a lot of messaging and political identity building that there just isn't yet an equivalent
*  of on the left. I want to spend some real time here on the asymmetry in media structures,
*  because obviously it's something that I've experienced to some degree.
*  And I want to give some credit to the right-wing view that there is, I don't exactly want to call
*  it a bias, but there's a liberal acculturation in a lot of the media that the people in major newsrooms
*  are themselves much more liberal than they are conservative. And there's an integration in a
*  funny way between what you might think of as a liberal media, you know, an MSNBC or an American
*  Prospect, which is a small magazine I started out at, and mainstream media, you know, MSNBC
*  is part of NBC. And I know from having worked there that if MSNBC is getting liberal in a way
*  that NBC feels reflects badly on it, that the hammer comes down and people get very upset and
*  it becomes like a big internal political problem. And there's a way in which, of course, like there
*  is a liberalism, like particularly a cultural liberalism in the mainstream media, but there's
*  also a restraint built around these business models and these organizations that at least have
*  this self-conception of themselves as for everybody. The New York Times desperately wants to be a paper
*  for everybody. NBC wants it to be for everybody. And they have business models traditionally
*  from, you know, these local geographic monopolies, you know, and airwave monopolies, all the way up
*  to these sort of mass subscription operations that put this pressure to try to be palatable
*  to virtually every kind of consumer. And that's become harder and harder and harder in recent
*  years, but it is still a very, very present intention. And then as you go into the further
*  reaches of liberal or left media, people one day want to work at these organizations are somewhat
*  restrained by knowing what it looks like to be in these organizations. And I say all that to
*  serve up to you the counter question, which is conservative media, because it isn't intertwined,
*  with the exception of maybe the Wall Street Journal, with these mainstream, more establishment
*  organizations that have these business models that are about appealing to everybody,
*  develops a very different business model that I think helps create a different ideology instead
*  of practices. How would you describe like the business incentives of conservative media?
*  I think that's right, that there's both a difference in terms of the professional
*  practices, you know, ideas like objectivity are professional practices that have continued on
*  at places like NBC News or at the New York Times since, you know, the 1920s and 30s and 40s,
*  that are not necessarily the same constraints on conservative media. But the economic question is
*  really important, because in some ways, conservative media figured out the media
*  landscape and the shifts that were happening in the business of media, much better than some of
*  these more mainstream institutions. And that idea that if you have a devoted fraction of the potential
*  viewing or listening audience, that that devotion means people are going to keep coming back,
*  that they are going to trust the people who are speaking to them. So they're going to trust
*  somebody like Rush Limbaugh, they're going to buy the products that are sold during the advertisements.
*  And so you have this different conception of what it takes to make profitable media. And Rush Limbaugh
*  is really an innovator in this front. You know, the conservative media that I was talking about
*  earlier, like National Review, like the Smoot Report, they had not cracked the business code.
*  So it's not just about messaging to conservatives, but it is about offering a political message
*  that seems like it is going to have a real effect on how elections turn out and how people govern
*  while they're in office. And that triggers a set of emotions and attachments that make people
*  fervent fans. And I think that's what's so important. And that's the thing that Rush Limbaugh
*  figured out. And it's not just triggering the emotions of fear and anxiety and racial animus,
*  although those are all in play. But it is also about being really funny and being really
*  entertaining and drawing in those positive attachments as well. And conservative media
*  cracked that code a lot more quickly than left liberal media have. And as a result,
*  they have not only built these very powerful institutions politically, Rush Limbaugh was able
*  to go on air and say, you know, I don't like what Mr. Newt is doing today. And maybe you all should
*  call Congress and let them know how you feel. And that is a real muscle flex that Rush Limbaugh is
*  able to do. And he's also able to make a tremendous amount of money off of it. So that idea of kind of
*  micro-targeting or understanding narrow casting, that you want a small devoted audience and you
*  can make a lot of money that way. The right figured that out much more quickly, in part,
*  as you noted, because they weren't necessarily constrained by those professional practices
*  that a place like CBS News would have. I think part of it is that they figured it out. And I
*  wonder how much they were forced into it. And something I think about here is about what
*  attracts people to a media organization when they come to you. What are they coming for?
*  And in a lot of conservative media and some liberal media, they're really coming for the
*  politics. If you watch Fox News, if you listen to, you know, back in the day, Rush Limbaugh,
*  maybe today Ben Shapiro, if you watch MSNBC, you're coming for the politics. And so if that
*  politics is conservative, that's really, really important. If it's a liberal, it's really important.
*  A lot of other kinds of media organizations, more mainstream organizations, I think something that
*  often gets missed and is really important is that politics is one of the things they do,
*  often not the main one, often definitely not the one that keeps people coming back,
*  right? In local newspapers, the sports section and the classifieds were really, really important.
*  At the New York Times, you know, how do you feel about our cooking content, our recipes? Like,
*  what do you think of Wartle? It really matters. Like, that's a big part of the business. It's
*  not the only thing. The style section is important. The book review is important.
*  These things that are really not in that way political. It's a reason I think the
*  Wall Street Journal has always been a different kind of institution than a lot of what we think
*  of as conservative media. It is conservative in the sense that it is a place where you have more
*  conservatives working. It's owned now by Rupert Murdoch, but it's a business newspaper first. And
*  so it has this other set of things it is doing before it gets into the question of its own politics.
*  NPR is another good example of this where, you know, culturally, I think it's fair to say
*  it is liberal, but is what NPR is doing? Is it first politics? No, they're trying to be a
*  news organization and have these local affiliates. It's a bunch of other things. So I wonder how much
*  one of the things that has also happened here is that a lot of the space of these organizations
*  that are cross-pressured in their missions, cross-pressured in their offerings, and so
*  a little held back from going all in on politics. Those organizations have taken up a lot of that
*  room. And so as conservative media emerges, it is more explicitly conservative. The market
*  niche it is filling is not a counter news or media establishment, but an unfilled political
*  conservative niche. It's such a smart observation, Ezra, because that's exactly right. The kinds of
*  stories that make their way into conservative media, they're not always about electoral politics,
*  but kind of the hump that you have to get over to talk about a story on, say, Fox News is that it
*  has to have a politics to it, right? It has to fit into a broader narrative about politics, about the
*  right about conservatism and culture. And that is something that is built into the missions of
*  these outlets from the very beginning. Whether you're looking at something like National Review
*  that comes out of this frustration with feeling that conservatives aren't well enough represented
*  in the Republican Party or in institutions like universities, or if it's something like Fox News
*  that even though it declared itself to be fair and balanced was clearly trying to tap into a more
*  conservative political market. If that is your identity and your mission from the start, that shapes
*  why people come to you, but it also shapes the content that you put on. And if you stray too far
*  from that, people might go with you a little bit if they are really attached to a particular host.
*  So I think you're exactly right about looking at the mission and the purpose of these outlets in
*  order to understand why they function so differently. One recurrent story I seem to see play out in
*  right-wing media is that media outlets that are ultimately close to people in power, right?
*  Sean Hannity is very friendly with Donald Trump. They're all friendly with George W. Bush.
*  They will at times try to push the party or align with a party push towards the center.
*  I think of a very famous period in this as after the 2012 election when Republicans lose to Barack
*  Obama, there's a decision clearly being made and argued at the Republican elite level that they need
*  to moderate on immigration. And so there is this big effort, the gang in the Senate emerges and
*  they come up with this immigration bill and Sean Hannity has Marco Rubio, who's now seen as a future
*  leader of the party on to talk about it. And Sean Hannity endorses immigration reform and the thing
*  dies under another conservative revolt. And Hannity eventually has to repudiate his own
*  endorsement of that bill. But I think you see it a bit in the very, I think, famous and dramatic
*  first Republican debate at Fox News where it's pretty clear Fox News comes to deflate the Donald
*  Trump balloon and Donald Trump goes to war with them and he wins. I agree with you that
*  conservative media often wants to mediate between these different wings of the Republican party,
*  but it seems in the end that they need the audience. And the audience is this more
*  ethno-nationalist counter-establishment base, which is not the elite level of the Republican
*  party and is often in somewhat contradiction to them, but is becoming through this whole era
*  just more and more the audience for conservative media and is able to use conservative media and
*  drag conservative media towards itself in a way that really increases its influence over the party.
*  Does that feel right to you? Not only does it feel right, but it actually helps to counter,
*  I think, a misconception that a lot of people have or a way we have of talking about
*  right-wing media, this idea that Fox News pronounces or Rush Limbaugh pronounces and the right-wing
*  masses just follow along, that there's a kind of brainwashing that's happening or an influence
*  that only moves in one direction from right-wing media to the base. What that particular instance
*  around immigration in 2013 points to, what the rise of Donald Trump points to, is that that's not
*  the case at all. I mean, in some ways, while it is absolutely the case that on the margins,
*  there is influence that media outlets have that can help shape people's points of view on particular
*  policies, particular directions that the party are going or particular candidates, that they need
*  their viewers more than their viewers need them in a lot of ways, in part because viewers are often
*  voters and so they have that sort of power, and also because they can make their displeasure known
*  by changing the channel or turning the dial. You actually see this in a pretty dramatic way after
*  the 2020 election because Fox News calls Arizona and then ultimately calls the election correctly
*  for Joe Biden. There's a backlash from the base, from the audience of Fox News, in which viewers
*  went over to places like Newsmax and One America News, more far-right, more election denialist
*  spaces in order to make their displeasure known. That doesn't cause Fox News in that instance to
*  reverse its call, but it does alert Fox News to the need to draw those people
*  back in and to deliver content that will reassure viewers that they're actually on their side.
*  That dynamic is really important because I think we often point to right-wing media as being sort of
*  anti-democratic and being this big institution that has muscled its way to the center of
*  American politics and has unseemly power. Those things may still be true, but the messaging and
*  the policy preferences often reflect the preferences of voters and of the conservative base. It's often
*  the case that these outlets have to fall in line. What's interesting now is that there is such
*  a robust right-wing media ecosystem that people have choices. Back in the 1980s and the 1990s,
*  we really had a limited number of options. Take the case of Fox News. In 1996, they were pretty
*  much it when it came to right-wing cable news outlets. That's no longer the case, and it's why
*  people were able to show their displeasure by going to Newsmax and going to One America News
*  because they had more options. That's another thing that has empowered the base
*  in relationship to right-wing media over the past 10 or 15 years.
*  CB So one theory of the Republican Party that I am interested in is that it has long had this
*  contradiction at its heart between its money funder corporate Koch brothers class, which has built
*  very, very powerful extra party institutions like Americans for Prosperity and Heritage Action and
*  the American Legislative Exchange Council and so on. It wants things like deregulation, it wants
*  tax cuts, it wants immigration reform, it wants pro-business policy, but it's also at some level
*  fairly urban and cosmopolitan and educated. It's not upset about the cultural direction of the
*  country really. It wants money or it wants the ability to make money. Then there's this
*  ethno-nationalist base, which is very upset about the cultural direction of the country.
*  Theda Scotchpole and Vanessa Williamson did a great study of the Tea Party years ago that
*  really got at this, which is a lot of people wanted to say the Tea Party was there to create
*  the Ryan budget and cut entitlements, but they didn't find that at all. The Tea Party was upset
*  about immigration, about changing racial dynamics, about secularization, about liberalization, about
*  cosmopolitans. That top of the party has become more powerful. They've gotten way more money
*  because of changes in campaign finance reform and inequality and more organizational sophistication.
*  They've actually, or at least for much of the 2000s, pulled the Republican Party's economic
*  policy well to the right. I mean, all the way to the point that you have the Ryan budget getting
*  all this attention, cutting Medicaid and cutting Medicare and cutting Social Security at different
*  points, which is not something that was very popular among the Republican base. But as the
*  Republican media organization gets stronger and as it becomes more competitive, this dynamic you
*  just mentioned, and I think even more so as it then becomes attached to social media, which makes it
*  even more responsive to what Republican activists and super posters are interested in online,
*  that the Republican base, which has often had trouble speaking, becomes really, really loud.
*  And that one explanation for why the party at the middle has become weaker is that its top wing got
*  stronger with money and organization. Its internationalist wing got stronger through
*  the media. And it just doesn't have the power or the tools or really even the ideas that would
*  effectively mediate between these two bases. So they're always kind of at war with each other.
*  They ally for a while, but then when you get to the agenda, when you get back into power,
*  they quickly go back to a fighting mode. What's so fascinating about that, because I do think
*  that that's a pretty accurate description of the changes and the tensions that have happened,
*  particularly in the past 20 to 25 years in the Republican party, is that it is both true that
*  the Republican party has moved further to the right, that it has shedded moderates, and certainly
*  there are no more liberal Republicans to be found. So it has become in some ways more
*  ideologically cohesive, but it is still very much a coalition. And it is a coalition, again, because
*  conservatism is such a capacious ideology that it supports both the Wall Street Journal opinion page
*  and sites like Breitbart. And those are in, as we've seen more visibly in recent years,
*  in constant conflict with one another. And the base has found that not only
*  are conservative media outlets a pretty powerful tool that they can wield, but also that they have
*  real strength in primaries. I mean, one of the places you see the tension between these two sides
*  of the party play out have been in primaries since 2010, as the more ethno-nationalist wing of the
*  party has really targeted more established figures. And even though there have been real efforts to
*  try to hold this coalition together, to try to get a little bit of what the party elites want,
*  or the Koch brothers' wing wants, so maybe those massive tax cuts that Donald Trump passes early
*  on, you get something like Paul Ryan as the Speaker of the House for the first two years of the Trump
*  administration, which really is kind of the symbol of the balance or the coalition between these two
*  parts of the movement and parts of the party. But at the end of the day, where is Paul Ryan?
*  Even though he was quite young and seen as the policy wonk driving the Republican Party, he's not
*  in Congress anymore. He retired from his life as a member of Congress in 2019. But there is this
*  sense that there is just this coalition that is working things out and that in the past,
*  I would say 15 years or so, the base has found so many more tools. You're right about social media
*  as one of those tools. You're right about conservative media as one of those tools.
*  I would add on that the ability to do fundraising with small dollar donations. That has been a
*  pretty empowering tool for parts of the right-wing base to push back against those big Koch money
*  donations and level the playing field of it. I think that last part is so important because
*  there's a shorthand. I was just using it. You have money at the top and media at the bottom.
*  But media in online small donor fundraising world becomes money. I think it is so telling
*  that if you look at Open Secrets, which tracks money and politics, Marjorie Taylor Greene is
*  one of the top 10 house fundraisers of the 2022 cycle. Marjorie Taylor Greene's colleagues hate
*  her. The sort of coke wing of the Republican Party is not there for Marjorie Taylor Greene
*  and her Jewish space lasers, but she is just a constant figure in right-wing social media and
*  media. She has no super powerful committee assignments, nothing that would make her a
*  fundraising juggernaut in 1955. But she actually is a fundraising juggernaut now, which in addition
*  to meaning she has attention and helps define the Republican Party publicly and cause problems
*  often for it, she does have power because she has money.
*  LWK And she doesn't rely on the party infrastructure in order to fundraise,
*  in order to get her message out. And so that really does weaken the party as an institution.
*  It doesn't have any real way to discipline her. Back in the 1990s when Newt Gingrich was
*  the Speaker of the House, there had been that long government shutdown. At the time,
*  it was the longest in US history. It spanned from the end of 1995 to early 1996. And Gingrich,
*  realizing he had lost public opinion, that there was nothing more to be gained from having the
*  government shut down, decides that he's going to make a deal to reopen the government. And
*  there is a group of Republicans to the right of Gingrich. They call themselves the true believers
*  and they don't want to reopen the government. They like it just fine that the government is
*  shut down and they think that the government shutdown should continue. And the holdouts who
*  don't move to help open the government back up, Gingrich had tools to try to discipline
*  the people who were revolting against him. Kevin McCarthy now can say, I'm not going to give you
*  committee assignments, although he's taken a very different approach to dealing with this.
*  A bunch of them. He couldn't say that. It's kind of amazing how weak of a position that he's in.
*  But he also just not only does he not have the tools to discipline folks, but he actually has
*  to continuously give away the other power that he has in order just to become speaker. So it's a
*  remarkable change and a fairly short amount of time on the political scale. Let me ask you then
*  about what comes next. Because I think there's a tendency when we try to tell the story of the
*  modern Republican Party to yada, yada, yada this part, right? There's new Gingrich and then he
*  falls and then it's John Boehner and Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy and Donald Trump. But there's
*  Dick Army, who's majority leader. And then there's the era of Tom DeLay in particular.
*  And Denny has stood as speaker, but as a less powerful figure than DeLay, I think it's fair to
*  say. And I think this is an era. This is the era in which I start covering politics professionally.
*  And I think this is part of why there was this belief that Republicans are much more disciplined.
*  Tom DeLay's nickname is the hammer. There is this view that he can hold Republicans together
*  on things Democrats simply can't hold together on. There are these famous instances of unbelievable
*  legislative arm twisting, like when they're trying to pass Medicare Part D and they hold the floor
*  vote open forever. They end up with ethics complaints because of how hard they squeeze people,
*  which is seen at the time, I think, as an example of DeLay's power and ruthlessness.
*  And Democrats would never do this. And I think you can sort of in retrospect look at it differently
*  and look at it as an example of how hard they had to fight to pass this bill that maybe had actually
*  a lot of dissension around it. But how do you understand the delay period and this period in
*  which Republicans are seen as a more ruthless congressional force? That period is really
*  important as a transitional period. You come out of the Gingrich era, which was
*  to call it tumultuous, to put it very gently. It had been an era of tumult. And there were real
*  fractures in the Republican conference, but there were also then new kind of rules put into place
*  to help with cohesion. The Hastert rule comes out of this era, this idea that we're not going to
*  put anything on the floor that doesn't have a majority of Republican support behind it. We're
*  working within our conference instead of compromising and working with Democrats. So that kind of
*  helps in a way. And there are still ways to discipline members of the party. The conservative
*  media strength is still growing in that era. It's still an era of transition. Fox News had been on
*  since 1996, but it was still kind of finding its way forward, finding its way to having a more
*  substantial base for people to be able to access Fox News was still an early project in the early
*  2000s. You start to see at the beginning of the 2000s, the proliferation of talk radio voices.
*  That's when Sean Hannity gets his show, when Glenn Beck gets his show. So there's a moment of ferment
*  and the landscape is changing very quickly when it comes to media. And I think we can't discount
*  the cohering power of the September 11th attacks and the war on terror. That there also was this
*  outside force that at least for a few years was holding the party together in more unity.
*  And that's not to discount DeLay's power as a leader and his ability to sort of muscle people
*  into doing the things that he wanted them to do. But it is the context in which this is happening,
*  particularly in the first four or five years of the 21st century, that there are these larger
*  cultural and political forces that are helping people to fall in line in ways that they
*  might not have in the 1990s. And they certainly didn't after say 2007 or 2008, as George Bush
*  is becoming more unpopular and that there's a lot of fracturing happening on the right.
*  I'm really glad you brought that up because I think there's another narrative here that is
*  potentially very important that doesn't get looked at that much. So there's a view, I think you can
*  see in books like Gary Gersel's, The Rise and Fall of the Neoliberal Order, which I think gives
*  us real attention and I really recommend that book to people, that communism in the Soviet Union
*  had a very important co-hearing force on the Republican Party in the entire New Deal and into
*  sort of the neoliberal era. And it's in the inter-renium between the Soviet Union and 9-11
*  that you get this first real glimmer or exercising of I think what looks to me now like the modern
*  Republican Party, the New Gingrich Republican Party that really sees government as its true
*  primary enemy and to the point that it will shut it down. This is part of Gersel's point that
*  when it has to worry about communism, Republicans are actually held in place by being anti-government,
*  but they also have a positive agenda for the government. It's around defense,
*  they are fighting this external enemy. So you can't be completely nihilistic about government.
*  The Soviet Union falls and you kind of can be. Your enemies are liberals, your enemies are the
*  government, your enemies are other establishment, Republicans, Rinos. And then 9-11 happens and that
*  party disappears for a while again because you again have this more positive agenda. There's
*  something the Republican Party is trying to accomplish through government. It's at war with
*  the Al-Qaeda and to some degree the way they put it, the Islamic world. But then that threat
*  fades by the mid-2000s or 2010s and the trends of the Gingrich era take hold again. And you
*  again get this, the enemy is liberals, the enemy is the government, the enemy is other Republicans.
*  How do you think about that? It's something I've thought about a lot lately as I was trying to
*  parse through the differences between a figure like Ronald Reagan and a figure like Newt Gingrich,
*  because in many ways they share a lot in common in shaping a conservative era in American politics
*  and American government. But Reagan is also constrained by the Cold War. He is a Cold War
*  president and it's not just that he has to find those positive roles for government in places like
*  military and things like that, but he uses a language of democracy and freedom that is
*  very much shaped by defining the U.S. against the Soviet Union and has real policy implications
*  for Ronald Reagan. He is pro more open immigration because he believes that the free movement of
*  peoples is part of the democratic system and what makes it better. He is for free and open trade
*  because he believes that the free movement of goods is part of democracy and part of what makes
*  an open society. It is telling that in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Berlin
*  Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, you see a figure like Pat Buchanan emerge who does not
*  feel that he needs to have those same peons to democracy that Ronald Reagan brought forward,
*  who in fact is pretty skeptical of democracy as a system of government in a way that he couldn't
*  necessarily have embraced so vocally during the Cold War. It is no wonder that in the 1990s you
*  see the rise of a nativist anti-immigrant movement that is very contra the kinds of policies that
*  Reagan was promoting in immigration reform. And so there is something about the kind of disciplining
*  or constraining effect of these big geopolitical battles. And I think that that was important for
*  somebody in shaping somebody like George W. Bush, who had kind of a more constrained view of the
*  role of the U.S. in the world when he was running for president in 2000, that looks very different
*  after 9-11 when he has a more interventionist approach to foreign policy. And so I do think
*  that those bigger geopolitical dynamics are important. What I wouldn't want people to take
*  away from that though is that there is something particularly rosy or affirmative about having
*  those kinds of dynamics because of course there are enormous costs to those dynamics as well,
*  whether it's red baiting and the Red Scare or whether it is investigations and surveillance
*  of Muslim Americans. There's a real cost to that cohesion because it involves having someone who
*  is the enemy and that often involves the idea that there is an enemy at home as well.
*  AC I agree with all that, but I wonder if this need for an enemy ever goes away because I think one of
*  the implicit arguments here is that it doesn't, it just turns inward when Republicans don't have a
*  coherent enemy outward. I wonder how much you buy this argument that is very common among political
*  scientists. I see it, for instance, in this book, Asymmetric Politics by Matt Grossman and David
*  Hopkins, the essential difference between the parties is that Democrats are a policy demanding
*  coalition. Democrats have things they want the government to do. All these different coalitions
*  are parts of the democratic coalition. They're here to get something from the government.
*  And Republicans often don't. There are more ideological coalition, they're more about values,
*  they're more about a way they want the country to be. And this is why I found Gersal's argument
*  interesting because he's saying that in times of this kind of foreign threat, Republicans actually
*  develop a more coherent agenda of what they need from the government. And then a lot of other
*  domestic policies begin to make its way under that agenda. You go back to the highways being
*  built for national defense or the way that George W. Bush was able to get a lot of, I think, domestic
*  work done under the post-911 unity and urgency. But without that, Republicans, they have a
*  self-negating quality to them. They're this anti-government party, increasingly an anti-establishment
*  party. So when they run the government and they are the establishment, those tendencies can't
*  but turn on themselves. And even worse, because the way the American government is constructed,
*  and you need a lot of bipartisan cooperation, if your enemy becomes the Democratic party.
*  I had Michael Brendan Doherty, a Republican or a conservative, I should say, writer,
*  on a few months ago when I asked him, what is the Republican party? He said, well, it's not the
*  Democratic party. If your enemy is the Democratic party, but you often need to work with the
*  Democratic party to keep the government running, like for debt ceilings or to get bills passed,
*  and yet your whole politics as a Democratic party is the central threat to American life,
*  at some point that just becomes irresolvable. There's no way to act in a way that brings all
*  that together. Which is the crossroads that we're at at this moment, right? This moment of both
*  stasis and real danger that's growing out of that stasis and that kind of lockedness.
*  I do think that there is something to this idea that went in the face of a large geopolitical
*  threat, that that creates much more space for, in particular, a president to act and to pressure
*  members of the party that otherwise would not necessarily cohere as quickly. This is not
*  surprising that in states of emergency, there's just more room for presidents. Part of the reason
*  why we get so much innovation under Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, it's why we get so
*  much innovation and institution building during the Cold War. I do think that that is right.
*  I would just want to emphasize a continuity, which is it's not as though the Republican party
*  pokes up its head in 1991, looks around and says, oh no, we have no more enemies. We must go after
*  the Democrats. That anti-liberalism and anti-democratic party and that real and pretty
*  fervent dislike, disdain for attacks on Democrats and liberals and the left, that is there throughout.
*  I think it becomes more visible and it becomes much more the driver of a much broader body of
*  politics because the constraints of the need to address these larger international threats
*  has been eased somewhat. What's so remarkable about the Bush era is how quickly that all
*  falls apart. You have an event like 9-11 and you have all of this sort of bipartisan support
*  for something like the war on terror. Yet by 2006, George W. Bush is ineffectual as a president and
*  facing just repeated revolts from the base. It could be on things like his nomination of Harriet
*  Myers to the Supreme Court. It could be the immigration example that you mentioned earlier.
*  That part of the dynamic might be that when Americans are particularly concerned
*  about these larger outside threats, that they rally around government and they rally around
*  presidents in particular even more. That popularity is part of what gives those presidents
*  and those politicians more room to maneuver as opposed to something else. That popularity
*  and public support is one of the big components and maybe the
*  political structure through which or political reality through which their power drives.
*  CB I want to hold on the Bush era for a minute. I think there's a narrative among liberals
*  that when you think about the way the Republican Party began dissolving organizationally,
*  not in terms of its power or its base, but its ability to control itself in roughly the 2010s,
*  I think with the rise of the Tea Party, that feels like a disruptive moment, a moment where
*  trends that had been there for a long time tipped into the dominant equilibrium.
*  I think liberals tend to date this around Barack Obama. The election of the first black president
*  drives a part of the Republican ethno-national space a little bit crazy. I wrote a piece,
*  and I think this piece is largely true, called White Threat in a Browning America.
*  CB One thing I noticed when I talk to Republicans about this
*  is they will tell that story more about the Bush era itself. Rather than it being
*  Barack Obama's election, and maybe they don't want to confront some of the questions of why
*  Barack Obama's election seemed to set this off, but that they understand the Bush era as a kind
*  of trauma for the Republican base. Matt Contenetti, who was at the weekly standard and launched the
*  Free Beacon and recently wrote this history of the right, called The Right, made this point to me
*  that you really have to understand the Republican Party as there being a pre-financial crisis
*  Republican Party and a post-financial crisis Republican Party. That the financial crisis did
*  so much to discredit the Republican establishment to the base, the TARP votes were such, occasioned
*  such fury from Republicans. I think you could also throw into that the Iraq War and that hangover,
*  that there's a view, and you see this a little bit in Donald Trump running so much against Jeb
*  Bush and the Bush family, there's a view that Bush failed so completely that the tenuous hold
*  the establishment had on the grassroots, the trust it had from them to the extent it had any,
*  was lost in a way that it has never been and may never be able to be regained. Do you buy that?
*  I do buy that. I think that it is the case that the election of Barack Obama had a metastasizing
*  effect on this discontent and this anti-establishment movement and the kind of, in many ways, the
*  radicalization of the Republican base. I think there's a lot of political science that underscores
*  that belief. At the same time, the crackup in the party or at least the strengthening of anti-establishment
*  forces in the party were there earlier. You didn't always see it at the national level.
*  Sometimes it was kind of sub rosa. When McCain and a few other Arizona members of Congress were
*  working in, say, 2003 or so on immigration reform, they would go home and they would be met by
*  incredibly hostile constituents who did not want those reforms. That really backed them off of
*  doing immigration reform until that second term of the Bush administration. Again, the revolts
*  that were happening against Bush, they weren't just about the housing crisis, although of course,
*  TARP and those votes have a huge effect on the disaffection towards President Bush. It was already
*  there. The loss of the 2006 midterms, the corruption and all the scandals that the party
*  was dealing with in 2005, 2006, the sense that Bush was just helping out his buddies
*  and he was appointing these people in positions that weren't out there to defend conservatism,
*  but were there because they were golf buddies or they were friends. It was more of this kind of
*  you're not taking care of the movement, you're taking care of yourself and that's not what we
*  want. That revolt was, I think, well underway in advance of the 2008 election. What the 2008
*  election does is it, in many ways, it displays not just with the election of Barack Obama,
*  but the splits between John McCain and his team who were running the presidential campaign for
*  the Republicans and Sarah Palin. That is one of those points where the tensions between somebody
*  who was seen as an outsider and an up and comer and somebody who was willing to stand up to the
*  establishment actually face off with the establishment as she detailed her fights with
*  the campaign team within the McCain ticket. I think that there's a lot you can see in advance
*  of 2008 that suggests something much bigger was shifting and in fact suggests that the
*  September 11 attacks and the kind of political cohesion that followed for the next few years
*  disguised a lot of the ongoing changes and unhappinesses that were already in place.
*  I think that moment of McCain-Palin is so interesting and it brings up this issue,
*  which I think is really hidden by the singular way we talk about the Republican Party, the
*  Republican base, the Republican grassroots as if it's unchanging over time. It brings up this issue
*  of how the composition of the Republican Party changes in this era. So you have had over the past
*  20, 30 years a real change in educational polarization, in particular the Democratic
*  Party is winning in an accelerating way since Donald Trump, college educated whites who used
*  to be an important backbone of the Republican Party, Democrats are becoming much stronger in
*  the suburbs, weaker and weaker and weaker in rural areas. If you think about the Republican Party and
*  frankly the Democratic Party is always having pro-establishment and anti-establishment wings.
*  One thing that seems to me to have happened is that the voters of the Republican Party lost
*  where the voters inclined towards the establishment and they've gone into the
*  Democratic Party and I think made the Democratic Party a more pro-establishment party than it used
*  to be, closer in some ways to big business, et cetera. And the Republican Party has imported
*  a lot of very, very anti-establishment voters, voters who in many cases are the kind of Richard
*  Hofstadter paranoid style in American politics voters. And so just the relative strength of the
*  Republican electorate, how strong the people who believe in institutions are versus how strong the
*  people who are really in politics because they hate institutions and feel they're corrupt and
*  feel they should be mistrusted and burnt down. And that is their politics. It's not a kind of
*  nihilism. It's a belief about the world that that's really easy to miss, but I think
*  maybe the core of this story actually. Right. And that there is as part of that
*  anti-institution, anti-establishment ethos, there really is an idea that you cannot brook
*  any sort of compromise. And that's any sort of compromise with Democrats, of course,
*  but really any sort of compromise, even with Republican leaders and the Republican establishment.
*  And you don't necessarily see that same dynamic occurring within the Democratic Party because the
*  Democratic Party is having these same fights at the same time. Right. Barack Obama is the less
*  establishment candidate than Hillary Clinton in 2008, the fights between Bernie Sanders supporters
*  and Clinton supporters in 2016. Right. The same kind of dynamics are playing out, but there is a
*  reconciliation that happens in part because I think that, and this refers back to something
*  you talked about earlier, there are bigger policy goals that are at play. And so you have the fights
*  and then you fall back together in order to move forward toward those goals incrementally. And so
*  in many ways, I guess, what you're seeing is a reverse of the line that you opened this
*  conversation with, which is Republicans fall in love and Democrats fall in line. And for the
*  less establishment forces in the Democratic Party, they've been more willing to work with leadership,
*  I think, than you have seen on the Republican side. And part of that is, as you're pointing out,
*  there really are just two very different groups. And in fact, you saw these two very different
*  groups in the 20 or so anti-McCarthy votes in the recent leadership fight, that there were actually
*  two groups involved in that fight. One group was people like Lauren Boebert and Matt Gaetz, who
*  just want nothing to do with Kevin McCarthy and whose political power and influence and identity
*  derives from this idea that they will never work with the establishment, even when they do. And
*  then you had a group that was led by people like Chip Roy, who have certain policies and certain
*  processes that they want put in place so that they can help to affect more conservative governance
*  while Republicans are in power. And those are the people who were in constant negotiation with the
*  McCarthy team and who ultimately were the ones who flipped their votes and voted for McCarthy as
*  speaker. So you could group those 20 together and just say, oh, that's just the more extreme part
*  of the Republican Party right now. But there are actually two very different ideas about governance
*  and about the establishment and about compromise that were playing out even within that small group
*  of dissenters. I've been thinking about this and how much I buy it because, well, let me try another
*  way of interpreting the two groups. And I'm not confident here. There's no doubt that Chip Roy is
*  a much more substantive anti-institutionalist than Matt Gaetz. And Matt Gaetz is slavish towards
*  Donald Trump and so on in a different way. Chip Roy had ideas and has ideas about how you can
*  run the house in a way that will give Chip Roy and people like him more power to stop things from
*  happening, more power to blow up processes, more power to throw sand in the gears of the machine.
*  And he talks about it like that. And Matt Gaetz is more performative to the extent he is an
*  anti-institutionalist. It is about being one in public, not in private, I think. He's talked about
*  wanting to be the conservative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But Ocasio-Cortez wants government
*  to do things. That is why she, in the end, tends to work with the Republican Party and vote on bills
*  and try to alter bills, and Matt Gaetz doesn't. And so I don't want to say there's no difference
*  between a Gaetz and a Roy, but I think what unites them, which is really important,
*  is that they don't want the government to do much. They're not there to achieve something.
*  They're there much more to either express displeasure or actually be part of an action
*  on stopping, particularly Democrats, but often, I think, for them Republicans, from achieving things.
*  They were on board with enough in the Trump era that it's like the Republican Party is a very
*  different beast in opposition than it is in the majority. And so you can get into a lot of
*  the Talmudic questions about how deep these views run, but trusting that sincerity can change
*  as your interests change. I do think there's something there that is still this desire to
*  make the place not work, as opposed to make it work. And those aren't really two sides of the
*  same coin. They're very, very, very different. That's a really excellent corrective because
*  what are the things that Chip Roy was fighting for? He was fighting for more power to stop
*  something like the passage of the omnibus bill that kept the government open and running.
*  He was fighting for more power to be able to wreck the debt ceiling negotiations. So yes,
*  he's kind of savvier. He understands better that you need to change the tools of the institution
*  and the processes of the institution in order to do those things. Whereas
*  Matt Gates is just kind of dancing around trying to blow it up rhetorically. So I do think that
*  that difference is less important than what unites them, which is the problem of having
*  anti-government forces who are running the government is that ultimately you get what we
*  have seen increasingly and repeatedly over the past 30 years or so, which are government shutdowns
*  and crises over debt ceilings and sequestration and all of these maneuvers that work to make
*  government less effective. And in fact, that underscores a broader political goal that
*  most people now, I think within the Republican party, or at least the office holders within
*  the Republican party support, which is you shouldn't trust government, don't like government,
*  government is bad and look, it can't do anything. And part of the reason it can't do anything is
*  because we're making sure that it can't do anything. And that has been a pretty vicious
*  cycle that the country has been caught up in for more than a generation now.
*  CB Why are Republican, I don't want to call it moderates, but less conservative figures so weak.
*  So imagine another way all this plays out. You're on failed vote 11 for Kevin McCarthy.
*  And I think the fact that Kevin McCarthy has won the speakership is basically a disaster now.
*  He is so weak. He has been proven so weak before he ever takes a gavel. The fact that he is not the
*  guy is just obvious. And he is in a lineage of failed speakers now, like Paul Ryan slinks away
*  after just a couple of years, John Boehner quits whistling Zippity Doo Dah, Eric Cantor, who is
*  supposed to be the third member, along with McCarthy and Ryan of the Young Guns, who is
*  considered the likeliest speaker of them all, loses in a primary to Dave Brad. I mean, being
*  speaker of a Republican House is just a disaster of a job at this point. And McCarthy is, from
*  everything we can tell, looks like he's going to be the weakest of the crew. And the idea that it
*  is this conservative rump, the Freedom Caucus controlling everything, it is repulsive to the
*  40 or 50 Republicans on the other side of the caucus. And they could have joined with Democrats
*  or others to elect a Republican speaker who is more their kind, right? Bring Fred Upton of Michigan
*  back or something. And they don't. They don't do anything. They just submit and submit and submit
*  and then whine in the press and submit and then eventually lose elections because a party's gone
*  so far right that their districts are no longer defendable. And I don't get it. I don't get why
*  so many of these people are so weak, what it is about the character of the Freedom Caucus that
*  will let them stand up and go to war for what they believe in. And yet the Republican center or, you
*  know, further left even than that, has so little interest in trying to wrest their chamber back
*  from the people who have taken it from them and have weakened them.
*  LESLIE I mean, I think that at least part of it is they're pretty outnumbered, even if there are 40
*  or 50. And I agree that moderates isn't the right term, but that we also have a kind of poverty of
*  political language at the moment, that people who just want to get on with things and actually get
*  things done. First of all, they might not identify as a cohesive caucus within the
*  Republican conference, right? They might not feel the kind of unity of purpose that the
*  House Freedom Caucus does. They're certainly not being backstopped by powerful media voices in the
*  same way that the House Freedom Caucus would be. And it's probably really difficult to raise a lot
*  of money off of the idea of partnering with the Democrats to pick a speaker. And that sort of
*  illustrates one of the boxes that Republicans are in at the moment, is that you are going to face
*  many more political problems in teaming up with the Democrats than you are going all the way to
*  the far right of the party and mucking up the operations of the House. Just where the media
*  incentives are, where the base incentives are, there isn't a passionate middle for the right,
*  or for the Republican party. And so that puts, it makes it much more difficult to stick your
*  neck out. And part of me also agrees with you, is like, what are you there for? Like, are you just
*  there to continue to have power indefinitely until the process that you described happened,
*  where you're finally forced out by a primary challenger from your right? Or are you there
*  to actually do things? And if you're there to actually do things, you should probably get
*  around to doing them and figure out the alliances and coalitions that you need to build to do
*  the things that you were sent to Congress to do. There is very little political courage at the
*  moment among that faction of the Republican party. And in part, they're being disciplined by what they
*  saw say around the January 6 committee, right? The folks who stood up and said, you know what,
*  morally, I cannot defend the insurrection at the Capitol. Morally, I think that we need to do
*  something, whether it's serving on that committee or impeaching Donald Trump. Like, we have to do
*  something. And the people who went with what they thought was the right thing to do, ultimately,
*  it costs quite a number of them their jobs. And if you don't see an upside to it, and you want to
*  keep holding on to your position because you believe there are longer term goals that you can
*  continue to work on, that could be part of the dynamic. But now I'm just psychoanalyzing people
*  because I also agree that it is a little frustrating for people in power to just ride the tides and not
*  actually do much of anything. I think that's a fair psychoanalysis. And certainly the example
*  of Liz Cheney, or for that matter, separately, you know, all of your colleagues who have been
*  primaried over the years is going to be in everybody's head. It just seems to me as a
*  matter of survival, to say nothing of thriving, that at some point, the more mainstream part of
*  the Republican caucus or conference would want to come up with something new. I mean, another way
*  of looking at it is looking at Boehner and Ryan, who had a lot of power, actually. I mean, Ryan is
*  quite well liked by his colleagues, just miserable. And Boehner was a fairly capable speaker, not,
*  I think, a historic man for the job in his time, but knew the institution, had support.
*  And the thing that I noticed with Republicans, which is interesting and consistent now,
*  is that they really don't even keep fighting their own pace. It's not like they typically
*  fight and lose. Liz Cheney was interesting in that she actually ran and lost. But before you get to
*  the Liz Cheney level of going toe to toe with the Republican party, and particularly the Donald Trump
*  wing of the Republican party, you could really fight with the Freedom Caucus, and you could really
*  be making other kinds of deals. You could be doing internal party warfare, you know,
*  internal party factional maneuvering. And a lot of them just retire rather than trying.
*  You know, Ryan's like that, Boehner's like that. You know, and then they'll send me speak their
*  mind three years later in a Tim Alberta profile in Politico or something. And it's just very
*  frustrating. I don't think the, it's just not the history of party politics,
*  that parties stay the same way forever. But in the way that you did need people like Newt Gingrich
*  to actually pick up on what was possible and organize against it, you do need people to try
*  to create other realities and see if the response is there. And they just don't. They were all just
*  so quiet in the McCarthy situation. I mean, they didn't come up with anything new they could do.
*  They just, you know, McCarthy, who had submitted to everything and the submitting to even more and
*  trading away even more power, they never came up with another play that could sideline these
*  people they hate. Like, I think it's so important. They hate these members of their own party,
*  and they do nothing about it. That should motivate them. Very frustrating. Yes. I mean,
*  that level of submissiveness or inaction is baffling. And it actually reminds me of this book
*  that I've been reading, Timothy Schenck's Realigners, where he looks at the ways that
*  parties and coalitions change over the course of American history. And he gets to the contemporary
*  era and he looks around and he's like, we're sitting on a knife's edge, where parties are
*  constantly trading power back and forth, nobody can build lasting stable coalitions. You don't see
*  things like the landslides of the 1980s or the 1970s or the 1960s or the 1930s. Like, where have
*  all the landslide elections gone? Where has all the one party dominance that has defined most of
*  American history? Where has that gone? Why can't people build these big stable coalitions anymore?
*  And that is a question not only for the Republican Party, but it's actually a question for the
*  Democratic Party as well. You can point to institution, you can point to structural changes,
*  issues around voting and gerrymandering and all of that. But it is also the case that the Democratic
*  Party does not have massive majorities like we saw in an earlier era that allowed for a kind of
*  stability of government and for more coalition building and for more horse trading and the kinds
*  of things that would make for at least a functional politics, would at least move the country willfully
*  in a particular direction. Spoiler, like he doesn't necessarily have an answer for why that's not
*  happening right now, but it does point to that we are in this moment of real aberration in the
*  longer history of party politics and this kind of weak needness or this inability to do the kind of
*  coalition building that has defined so much of American politics. That's an ingredient that is
*  missing right now and the politics that we see playing out not only in the Republican Party,
*  but in the Republican and Democratic parties and in election after election is a consequence of
*  that lack of a real solid realignment in politics. I'm going to check that out. I love that
*  recommendation and I think that's actually a good bridge to our final question, which is what are
*  three books you'd recommend to the audience? Well, I have been reading so many really great
*  history books lately, history books that are doing rich and innovative and deep work, but are also
*  incredibly readable and accessible in a way that sometimes the most innovative work isn't. One that
*  I would recommend is actually really well timed for the fact that we're at the beginning of a new
*  year. People are thinking about hitting the gym again. It's a book called Fit Nation, the gains
*  and pains of America's exercise obsession by Natalia Petruzzella. It's basically like this
*  hundred year look at exercise in the United States. One of the things that's so smart about
*  what she looks at is she looks at the way that exercise becomes kind of this luxury good as
*  there's a public disinvestment from parks and physical education and the kinds of things that
*  would help everyone have access to fitness and to exercise. So I definitely want to recommend that.
*  There is a book that's not out yet, but it's coming out in May and it's brilliant. It's called
*  Dreamland, America's immigration lottery in an age of restriction by Carly Goodman. And it's about
*  this thing called the diversity lottery, which is a policy that the U.S. uses in order to allow
*  people from underrepresented countries access to the United States. They might not have through
*  skill visas or through family reunification visas. And it was originally created actually in the
*  the 1980s and 1990s because there were so many Irish immigrants coming to the United States
*  without visas or falling out of status. So who were here without documentation and powerful figures
*  like Ted Kennedy wanted to work to put these people back into status and bring more Irish
*  immigrants over because there were more people who wanted to come than the quota allowed.
*  And what ultimately ends up happening though is that this diversity lottery becomes a key for
*  people from places like Ghana to come to the United States. And it builds this whole infrastructure
*  of a kind of lottery for coming to the U.S. It's a fascinating story. It seems like it's about a
*  small thing, but it's actually this big, beautiful, sprawling story about immigration
*  in recent years. And then the third one that I want to recommend is Jefferson Cowey's Freedom's
*  Dominion, a saga of white resistance to federal power. This is a book about white resistance to
*  federal power. It's a big, huge, long story. But he roots it in one tiny place, Barbara County,
*  Alabama, which is actually the county that George Wallace is from. And he looks at how over the
*  course of more than 150 years, white people in Barbara County resist all sorts of federal
*  intervention in order to retain the freedom to oppress, whether that's the freedom to impress
*  indigenous people or the freedom to oppress black people. He looks at how that plays out on the
*  ground in this very small place. All three of these are just gorgeously written books, really
*  eye opening. So I wanted to put them on everyone's radar. Nicole Hammer, thank you very much.
