# What’s Really Going On in Russia?
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [June 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmwQKXgvIjU)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  Before we begin, we are doing another Ask Me Anything episode, our quarterly AMA.
*  This will be the last one before I go on book leave for a bit, so if you've got anything
*  you want to hear me answer on the show, anything at all, send it in to EzraKleinShow at NYTimes.com
*  with the subject line AMA.
*  But to today's show and to just the world, what the hell happened in Russia last weekend?
*  All of a sudden we had Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group marching not on Ukraine
*  but on Russia.
*  They took control of the city, they shot down helicopters and they advanced about 125 miles
*  outside Moscow.
*  They were led by Evgeny Pergozhin who swore, no, no, no, this was not an attempted coup
*  of Putin, it was just an effort to topple the corrupt and ineffective military leadership
*  Putin appointed and relies on and surrounds himself with.
*  Then unexpectedly, a ceasefire was negotiated by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko.
*  Somehow in that deal there were no criminal charges, no criminal charges at all for Pergozhin
*  and he got a secure exile, at least in theory.
*  I mean, that was something new.
*  You can march on Russia and Putin will let you out not only alive but without even facing
*  charges.
*  So what was this?
*  Was it a mutiny?
*  A coup attempt?
*  What does it mean for Vladimir Putin and the solidity of his regime?
*  What does it mean for Ukraine?
*  And I should say here there is just a lot we still don't know, a lot we are still learning.
*  The situation is changing and you'll hear it in this conversation even as we went to
*  tape.
*  But to have, I think, any chance of seeing through the fog here, you need a sense of
*  how authoritarian regimes work and particularly how they work in Russia.
*  And that's why I wanted Stephen Kotkin to come on the show.
*  Kotkin is a leading scholar of Russian history at Stanford.
*  He's best known for his multi-volume biography of Stalin, but he's very connected in the
*  region and has been a crucial interpreter of Putin's regime too.
*  As always, my email for guest suggestions, thoughts and AMA questions, Ezra Klein show
*  at NYTimes.com.
*  Stephen Kotkin, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you for the honor of the invitation.
*  I want to take people through a little bit of the background here.
*  So what is the Wagner Group and what has their role in Putin's regime in the war in Ukraine
*  been?
*  So the Wagner Group is a private business.
*  It's a private business that does state business in Russia.
*  Everything in Russia is state private overlap.
*  It doesn't matter which side it initiates from.
*  And so they have vast interests, African gold mines, many other very lucrative businesses
*  in Africa, as well as at home in Russia.
*  And in order to guarantee the cash flow of their business, the security of their business,
*  they created a security arm.
*  That security arm then grew into a business on its own.
*  So what was originally a means to an end became yet another business, an end in itself.
*  That business, we don't know quite what the revenues have been, but they've been very
*  substantial and enriched the people involved.
*  In addition, it had connections to Russian military intelligence so that Russian military
*  intelligence, the so-called GRU, could use these guys but with implausible deniability
*  while they use them.
*  So there's this guy, Utkin.
*  No one's ever heard of him.
*  Utkin is the guy who's known to Gehr, or calls signal, is Wagner.
*  And the reason he chose Wagner is because he's a quasi-fascist.
*  And Wagner was, of course, the beloved composer of Hitler and many others in the Nazi regime.
*  So you have a kind of private business making a lot of money, which also does dirty work
*  with this implausible deniability for Russian military intelligence, Syria, Mali, Central
*  African Republic, all the way in an arc towards Dubai.
*  Dubai is the sort of center of the Russian illicit economy.
*  And so there's this fantastic personality named Evgeny Prokhozhin.
*  And Prokhozhin starts out with a café.
*  And before you blink, he's catering Kremlin events for Vladimir Putin.
*  And more than that, he's doing the meals for the defense ministry, some of those no-bid
*  government contracts where not only is the price inflated, but the skimming is almost
*  unlimited.
*  And so he rises as a result of this opportunism.
*  And he's got all of these businesses plus the militia or the death squads, however you
*  want to call them.
*  And plus he's attached to the regime in these non-transparent, typical ways for Russia.
*  But they're going to take his businesses away.
*  He's now going to be subordinated to his enemies inside the Russian Ministry of Defense, and
*  they're going to expropriate him.
*  They're going to take every one of his businesses and cut him down.
*  And so he decides to move against that Minister of Defense, Sergei Shoigu, and that Chief
*  of Staff, Valeriy Gerasimov, before they take him down.
*  The other piece that you need to know is that this guy is just really good at social media.
*  He has an artistic side, a creative side.
*  He plays a thug.
*  He plays a thug who is tougher than any other thug, but who also is out for the little guy
*  and against the elites.
*  That is to say, he's got that faux populism streak.
*  And so he's very successful in the social media sphere in creating impressions about
*  who he is and what he can get done and how powerful he is.
*  He's telling truth about the corruption and incompetence of the Ministry of Defense, about
*  the failures of the war in Ukraine, about the motives, the corrupt motives over the
*  war in Ukraine.
*  So he's this liar who's doing truth telling with this tremendous social media following
*  on telegram channels in Russia, who has what I think is probably more than a billion dollar
*  business at stake.
*  And lo and behold, before they can take him down, he tries to move against them.
*  So during this period, before his actual move comes, he is, as you know, on social media,
*  on Telegram, which is a major platform in Russia for people who aren't familiar with
*  it.
*  And as you say, he's making these searing criticisms, not of Putin, but of the rest
*  of the defense leadership.
*  He is, in a sense, truth telling and in another sense, protecting his interests.
*  But he's out there with a lot of followers with a real imprimatur to his own name, attacking
*  the conduct of the war that ultimately resolves down to Putin's decision making.
*  And one question that those of us who are unfamiliar with the dynamics here have is
*  that in this world of highly censored media, it seems that on the other hand, Putin is
*  allowing Borgosian and also many of these more right wing nationalist war bloggers to
*  take a very critical line on the conduct of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and on the competence
*  of the people Putin has appointed to run it.
*  So why through these months, long months when Borgosian is making these attacks, why is
*  Putin permitting it?
*  That's a great question.
*  Could he fully have controlled it?
*  That's an open question for me.
*  Could he have controlled it better?
*  Yes, there's no doubt.
*  But here's the thing.
*  You know, in the animal kingdom, just about every animal has a predator.
*  In other words, every animal is looking over its shoulder or is racing away to try to escape
*  dangerous situations because that's just how nature is.
*  Red in tooth and claw.
*  Well, authoritarian regimes are like this too.
*  Each powerful individual has an enemy or a predator.
*  Most of those enemies are natural because they're competing for the same resources or
*  the same prestige or the ear of the leader.
*  Some of that is, in fact, deliberately instigated by the leader.
*  So the leader will give overlapping jurisdictions.
*  The leader will give the same assignment to multiple groups.
*  The leader will set up or exacerbate the conflict.
*  Why would a leader do that?
*  The same reason a leader appoints less than competent people to positions of power.
*  Because if they're good, they become a threat to the regime itself.
*  If they're not so clever but loyal, then you see them getting promoted to positions of
*  power.
*  This gives you an inherent inefficiency, a low quality performance for authoritarian
*  regimes because they have what we call negative selection, promotion of people precisely because
*  they're not the most talented.
*  And it also means there's endemic conflict, usually underneath the carpet, not easy to
*  see, occasionally becomes visible.
*  But in this case, in the social media environment that Russia is in today, like the whole world,
*  it was well above the carpet for a long time.
*  But the idea must have been or could have been, or let's speculate that it might have
*  been, that this is under control because the natural enemies will balance each other and
*  they're all dependent on the leader, the single leader for protection.
*  And so they won't cross the line or if they do cross the line, their predators will take
*  them down.
*  And so there's a way in which this is supposed to be partially automatic.
*  And so there can be some complacency in addition to a lack of understanding of social media
*  on the part of Putin because he himself doesn't use it.
*  He doesn't participate.
*  He's not on the internet as far as we know.
*  But in addition to that, there's some complacency that sets in.
*  And then, of course, finally, authoritarian regimes degrade over time.
*  They just get fat and happy, worse and worse, more and more corrupt, and they corrode themselves.
*  And so all of those processes are at work.
*  It's still nonetheless was a surprise that it got this far.
*  So when he is making his arguments about how the Wagner group has been mistreated, Purgosian
*  is saying, one, of course, that the war is being run in a corrupt and incompetent way.
*  But he says that the Wagner group is being starved of ammunition.
*  He then says there was an airstrike conducted against them, an airstrike against Russian
*  mercenaries by the Russian military.
*  And then on June 10th, the state military announces that all fighters will have to sign
*  contracts directly with the Ministry of Defense.
*  So they can't be this independent force anymore.
*  They actually have to sign up.
*  How much of this was, in your sense of it, truly Purgosian, losing a series of fights?
*  How much of it was, I mean, it's hard to know what to make of the airstrike allegation.
*  I have no idea if it's true.
*  But initially, the theory was maybe this is a coup.
*  And then quickly, the theory in the West begins to become this guy was hanging on for
*  dear life and finally attempts this very high-risk gamble to just try to survive.
*  Which theory do you subscribe to at this point?
*  Yes, so it's both.
*  That's how these regimes work.
*  Offense is the best defense.
*  You have to be on the front foot against your enemies before they get to you.
*  So he's conducting an offensive on the front lines against Ukrainian forces.
*  And he's conducting an offensive behind his back on the home front against his other enemies,
*  which are, as I said, the Ministry of Defense and the Chief of Staff.
*  And so he is not necessarily under siege the way that he described it.
*  I think we have to be careful taking at face value, like you said, the idea that he was
*  being bombed.
*  But nonetheless, they're clearly trying to undermine him and his work at every turn.
*  And you can see state media take credit for some of the Wagner quasi-achievements on the
*  battlefield in that hellhole that everybody now knows about Bakhmut.
*  And so you can be angry about that.
*  You do the hard work.
*  Your guys are the ones who die.
*  And then somebody back in a comfortable office gets the credit for it or the medal for it,
*  as it were, in the state media.
*  And so there's just roiling anger, resentment, fury back and forth because Prigozhin is talking
*  about the incompetence and corruption of the Minister of Defense and the Chief of Staff.
*  These are the guys who have the other nuclear football besides the president in Russia.
*  And at the same time, they are pouring poison into state media and into the president's
*  ear behind his back.
*  And so this kind of stuff, we normally don't get to see it as well as we got to see it.
*  But it's both a quasi-coup or attempted coup or what I would call an improvised coup.
*  Most coups fail.
*  This one sort of failed, but in an odd way, maybe not.
*  It's an improvised coup, but it's a defensive reaction to his potential expropriation.
*  You mentioned the June 10th announcement, which could only have come with President
*  Putin's acquiescence.
*  We don't know if Putin initiated it, but certainly he would have had to sign off on it, which
*  was the death knell for Wagner as an independent force.
*  And therefore, all of that business that's at stake.
*  You can now see Putin trying to protect, trying to keep in play all the Wagner businesses
*  from Syria through Africa and beyond without Prigozhin.
*  The value of that to Russia is enormous.
*  And so can Putin manage to retain that value without the guy who created it, for the most
*  part, Prigozhin?
*  And what will happen to the people who sparked this by going after Prigozhin and that he
*  then went after, but are still, as it were, in their positions?
*  So what we don't know is much greater than what we do know.
*  But this kind of stuff is what authoritarian regimes are self-susceptible to.
*  I think that point that what we don't know is more than what we do know is really important
*  for everyone listening here to keep in mind.
*  And I think in some ways, one thing that underscores it is we're speaking on Wednesday, June 28th.
*  And you mentioned this as being an improvised coup.
*  There's some new reporting sourced to US defense that suggests maybe it's more improvised than
*  people realized.
*  So the Wall Street Journal has a story today, and I'm going to read just a bit of it here.
*  They write, quote, Mercenary leader Evgeny Prigozhin planned to capture Russia's military
*  leadership as part of last weekend's mutiny, Western officials said, and he accelerated
*  his plans after the country's domestic intelligence agency became aware of the plot.
*  The plot's premature launch was among the factors that could explain its ultimate failure
*  after 36 hours.
*  And the story goes on to say that the plan was to capture the defense minister and a
*  general during a visit that they were planning to a southern region that borders Ukraine.
*  So there was in some ways, again, according to this and sourced to Western intelligence,
*  there was, according to this, a much more aggressive theory or plan here that then leaks
*  and Prigozhin simply has to improvise and move faster.
*  I'm curious what you make of that.
*  Yeah, I would just be cautious about the word plan.
*  You get into the archives of these regimes after they fall or even before they fall,
*  if you're lucky, and the word plan would not be the first word that would come to mind.
*  It's much more chaotic, much more improvised.
*  In addition, you have a collective action problem for any coup.
*  If you at the New York Times decide that the current executive editor is not to your liking,
*  and you want to organize an action against the executive editor and bring that person
*  down.
*  Keep an eye out, Joe Khan.
*  Right.
*  The first person you talk to is thinking, oh my God, is this a provocation?
*  Is my loyalty being tested here?
*  That person has to then run to Joe Khan and say, Joe, they're talking about insurrection
*  behind your back.
*  Then he names who it is.
*  You have a very hard time, even if you all agree that the person should come down, you
*  have a very hard time trusting anybody else with your desire to do that.
*  They don't know if you're serious or if you've been sent by Joe Khan to test their loyalty.
*  This is what it's like inside an authoritarian regime.
*  They don't trust their own elites.
*  They can't trust their own elites.
*  There's no trust among them.
*  Or as we like to say, there's no honor among thieves.
*  For them to organize a coup, to have a plan is extremely difficult because the first person
*  who learns this is going to rat them out, or the second person, or the third person.
*  It's not a plan if it's one person.
*  It's only a plan if it's many people and you would need many people.
*  Maybe we always have to be careful of our excellent intelligence services manipulating
*  us through leaks to shape stories.
*  I have a very high regard for the capabilities of our people who work in our intelligence
*  services, their level of analysis, their humility, their self-correction when they don't get
*  things right.
*  But I wonder, we pick up eavesdropped conversations.
*  A lot of this is electronic or signal intelligence.
*  People talk.
*  People chatter.
*  People say things.
*  They make stuff up.
*  They make themselves out to be more important.
*  They speculate.
*  They say, I heard this rumor, et cetera.
*  The chatter is one of the things that we get.
*  It's different when you see movement of tanks, movement of ammunition.
*  That's what our intelligence people picked up.
*  They saw the Wagner group stockpiling and stockpiling not in the front where they were
*  going or supposed to go towards the Ukrainians, but stockpiling in the rear.
*  That was the tip off that something was up.
*  If you're stockpiling in the rear while you're complaining you're not getting stuff, here
*  you are saying they're shortchanging you on ammunition.
*  You get this massive ammunition dump not far from Russian military headquarters running
*  the war in Ukraine.
*  I think that was a pretty big signal that our people picked up.
*  That's different from the chatter, the eavesdrop, bragging, boasting, or rumor-mongering.
*  Well to pick up on that, when I look at these stories that have been coming out today where
*  American intelligence officials, I'm not the one getting the leaks, but some members of
*  the American intelligence establishment are telling newspapers that we believe that there
*  was more of a plan here, the plan was more dangerous.
*  One of the pieces of intelligence here is that other generals, or at least another general,
*  knew that there was somewhat more communication between Pugosian and other members of the
*  Russian defense establishment than had been reported before.
*  You wonder, well why is that being told to the American media?
*  I mean, you have to suspect a little bit that there is an intention or an interest in making
*  Putin feel that his own government and his own army is less trustworthy, more dangerous,
*  maybe there are more elements plotting against him than he thought in an effort I would assume
*  to reduce the regime's efficacy.
*  So that's my sort of internal media assumption of what I'm seeing.
*  I'm curious if that seems right to you.
*  Hell yeah, for sure.
*  Their best general, who's anywhere near the top, Sergei Serevikin, he's the one that our
*  intelligence services are implicating in the plot.
*  And if you want to take out one guy from the Russian military who's competent and could
*  do the war in Ukraine a lot better, he would be your target.
*  Having said that, it could be true.
*  I'm not disputing that there could be a basis in fact here.
*  But yeah, the idea of targeting Serevikin, who supposedly was in with Prigozhin, knew
*  that this was happening.
*  But you can spin this out, Ezra, forever.
*  So let's say Serevikin knows.
*  If he doesn't tell President Putin, he's toast.
*  So he's got to tell the president.
*  He tells the president.
*  But the president may say, that's crazy.
*  Prigozhin would never do that.
*  He's not that kind of guy.
*  I know him way back from St. Petersburg days.
*  So just because some people might have been in on it, or been told, or heard rumors, or
*  warned about it, doesn't necessarily mean that through the chain of command, that had
*  any effect or the kind of effect that it should have had for someone like Putin.
*  You have here a situation where, again, there's no trust.
*  Everyone's got a predator.
*  They're assigned to each other.
*  These people are officially each other's enemies.
*  And so you think they're all on the same side.
*  They all wear the same jersey.
*  They're supposed to be working to score in the Ukrainian goal, not in their own goal.
*  But in fact, as we know from hundreds of years of history on the Russian side, Russia
*  always fights a two-front war, one against whichever enemy on the battlefield and another
*  on the home front, where the various factions are going after each other, hammer and tongue.
*  And so we'll get the story eventually.
*  This place leaks like a sieve, and they have almost no control over their electronics.
*  And so we have an overload of information.
*  And in our system, a lot of that will come out.
*  Some of it's come out already, as you've been alluding to.
*  But let's just wait before we make any far-reaching conclusions about who knew what and why, et
*  cetera.
*  So the improvisation, who knows?
*  There might have been five ideas or six ideas.
*  You get around talking over the campfire or on your cell phone with somebody else using
*  Signal.
*  And you start throwing ideas off.
*  What if we do this?
*  What if we do that?
*  What if we try this?
*  What if when they come to the Rostov military headquarters, we take them hostage and then
*  they can't expropriate our businesses?
*  So that's what we mean by a plan, I think, on the inside.
*  And then the idea that things accelerate or things leak.
*  Well, yeah, that's how every single coup is.
*  And nobody knows what's happening on the inside of a coup.
*  It's like a revolution.
*  You don't know it's a revolution until afterwards.
*  And someone writes a book telling you it was a revolution in some cases.
*  In other cases, you're trying to instigate a revolution and it doesn't work or you're
*  trying to instigate a coup.
*  These things are a mess on the inside.
*  And they all fail until suddenly, in a few cases, they succeed unexpectedly to all those
*  involved.
*  Let's talk through what we sort of know or at least sort of could see that happened here.
*  So the Wagner Group turns into Russia.
*  The forces enter Rostov and they move through the city and move over a pretty good amount
*  of land easily and don't seem to pick up much resistance from the Russian military.
*  And at a certain point, they really could.
*  They're not far at all at this point from Moscow.
*  So one thing that has been out there, at least in commentary, is that there is a lot of information
*  that should make Putin look bad or be afraid, that there didn't seem to be more resistance
*  to them.
*  On the other hand, maybe just people didn't understand what was happening.
*  What did you make of the initial ease of their march?
*  Yeah, so this was what we call an unintentional referendum on the Putin regime that he ended
*  up catalyzing or organizing.
*  So you start with the fact that this is about Ukrainian valor and ingenuity.
*  Ukrainian resistance, Ukrainian courage on the battlefield, Ukrainian ingeniousness has
*  put this pressure on Putin's regime.
*  So this starts with them.
*  And then, as I said, there are all of these inherent tensions within an authoritarian
*  regime, a lot of which the leader either instigates or tries to instigate, exacerbate.
*  And now you've got the equivalent of an unintentional referendum.
*  What do I mean by that?
*  So when Xi Jinping in China does zero COVID, and it's very draconian, and the local governments
*  are going broke, testing everybody so frequently, and lockdowns where there's no economic activity,
*  and there's discontent, Ezra, you don't know what the other people feel.
*  You know your feelings about the regime's policy, but you're not sure what the other
*  people think because you have a censored media space, and it's also very costly to
*  find out, to go out there on a limb, say some negative things and see what the reaction
*  might be, or to engage your neighbors in the conversations that they might rat on you.
*  But when Xi Jinping does this, he sparks protests from people who just can't take it anymore.
*  So he effectively stages a referendum on the regime where people who are not happy discover
*  that there's a lot of other people like themselves.
*  That's something that the regime has kept hidden, as I just described.
*  And then he goes from zero COVID, the draconian lockdowns, with this extremely frequent testing,
*  to let it rip COVID.
*  It's also a version of the referendum because people see that the regime is not very competent.
*  It turns out that they don't know what they're doing.
*  It turns out that they don't know more than we know.
*  It turns out that we can't rely on them, that the propaganda about how they're bringing
*  prosperity to China, it's a lie.
*  And so authoritarian regimes that catalyze these unwitting referendums can't put the
*  genie back in the bottle.
*  You can't restore the aura, the mystique of power.
*  This mystique of power, the aura of power where you know more, you see more, you're
*  more competent.
*  Other people may think you're not doing that well, but it's just because around you there
*  are minions who are not up to speed or whatever, but you are the one.
*  You are the guy.
*  And so once you lose that mystique of power, it's very difficult to get that back.
*  That's what Putin lost in Ukraine well before this recent progosian incident.
*  The mystique, the aura, the magic of power was gone.
*  Nobody believed he knew better.
*  He knew what he was doing.
*  He was smart.
*  He was infallible.
*  He was watching everything.
*  He was controlling everything.
*  The war exploded that.
*  You can be a military genius in propaganda, but war is something that really is revealing
*  of whether that's true or not.
*  And that's done.
*  And this is prior to progosian.
*  So the mystique, the aura is gone.
*  However, you have the mechanisms of power.
*  You hold in your hand the levers of power.
*  And those levers of power are so substantial, we underestimate what it means to sit in the
*  Kremlin or to sit there in Beijing in charge of China.
*  The levers of power are enormous and very far reaching.
*  And this collective action problem of moving against them, as I said, is very high bar.
*  And so Putin has this hollow regime that's still strong.
*  It's a paradox.
*  It's hollowed out.
*  The aura is not there.
*  The mystique is gone.
*  The corruption is now so corrosive.
*  The corruption is the system, and yet it's destroying the system.
*  So we're in this period now where Putin's regime has been shown not to have a lot of
*  support.
*  We had these surveys.
*  Do you support the war in Russia?
*  Or would you like to go to jail?
*  We've had a whole bunch of surveys like this.
*  Do you support the war or would you like your children to be kicked out of school?
*  Do you support the war?
*  Would you like to lose your job?
*  They don't ask the second question.
*  It's implied in the survey.
*  And the war that people support is also the war that they see on television, where it's
*  Ukraine, it's NATO committing the aggression against Russia, and it's the fate of the Russian
*  state which is its state.
*  Now we see with this unwitting referendum that it turns out there's not a lot of support
*  there.
*  It turns out that people didn't rush to show their loyalty.
*  They stood back.
*  They were either apathetic or worse.
*  Indifferent, yes, in most cases, but some were opposed.
*  It's just too costly to show your opposition potentially until there's more clarity.
*  And so he staged that referendum in a kind of emperor, no-clothes fashion, unintentionally.
*  That's what Progosian just did.
*  So even though the aura had been lost already, the mystique was gone.
*  And even though he still has the levers of power, he now has to look over his shoulder
*  and wonder who else was in on this?
*  Who else wants to take me down?
*  Who else are my potential enemies?
*  And he's already paranoid because paranoia is the job description of an authoritarian
*  ruler, especially in these Eurasian regimes like Russia or China.
*  And so now the paranoia becomes potentially even more dysfunctional, becomes a kind of
*  self-fulfilling prophecy.
*  If he goes after them, he could further destabilize.
*  If he doesn't go after them, he doesn't know if they'll be there for him.
*  If another accidental crisis or structural crisis that's triggered by accident confronts him.
*  And so it is destabilizing.
*  But remember, these regimes, they're always brittle.
*  They're all powerful and brittle at the same time.
*  And every day is existential for them.
*  We here in America, we hyperventilate.
*  Four years of Trump and it's the end of the world.
*  It's the end of democracy.
*  It's the end of America as we know it.
*  And then we have even events like January 6th.
*  And here we are on the other side of that.
*  And America is still here.
*  Now the other side is talking about how, you know, Biden, it's the end of the world.
*  We'll never get through this.
*  It's the end of the American way of life.
*  And I got to tell you, at some point, Biden will not be president anymore and America
*  will still be here.
*  It's not existential for us.
*  We're wrong to think that these kinds of problems in America are existential.
*  And for authoritarian regimes, little everyday quotidian built in issues can become existential.
*  They're subject to a kind of permanent potential political bank run on their regimes.
*  You brought up the loss of mystique in Ukraine for Putin.
*  And it seems like there's, at least from the commentary and analysis I've seen, another
*  one here, which is Prigozhin is marching.
*  They've taken a city.
*  There have now been skirmishes with Russian military.
*  They've shot at Russian military aircraft.
*  And there's fear of him and Wagner marching on Moscow.
*  And he doesn't do that, but nor is he killed or taken into prison or executed.
*  What happens is that a deal is struck.
*  And we don't know everything about the deal, but with the help of the Belarusian president
*  Lukashenko.
*  And from what we can understand, there are no criminal charges for Prigozhin.
*  Prigozhin is now in exile, not in jail.
*  And there's a surprise, I think, that you can move against, I mean, he says he wasn't
*  moving against Putin himself.
*  He was moving against the defense minister and others in the administration.
*  But you can move against Putin's government and survive.
*  You can move against Putin's government and just go into exile.
*  And that also seems to be either a mystique losing moment for Putin or a new kind of information
*  potentially for others in the regime.
*  And also just something people didn't expect from Putin.
*  He didn't seem like the kind of guy to take that and come to a quick negotiated settlement
*  as opposed to salt the earth with the remains of his enemies.
*  What did you make of that?
*  The key element here, and I think the piece that I got wrong most substantially, well,
*  I would say the biggest mistake I made in the heat of the moment analysis was the Belarus
*  Lukashenko piece.
*  So Alexander Lukashenko, a former collective farm chairman, has been running a Belarus
*  like a collective farm for as long as I can remember.
*  I forget when the exact date of his presidency dictatorship kicked in, but I was, my hair
*  was black and I had a lot more of it when he started.
*  So Lukashenko is in trouble.
*  He has tremendous opposition internally and he's arresting people who are rival candidates
*  in elections and then arresting or pushing into exile their spouses.
*  He's clamping down on every journalist he can.
*  He's dependent utterly on Moscow to save his butt.
*  So he shows up recently in Moscow at a meeting, which is live on Russian television in the
*  first two minutes of the meeting where they let the press in.
*  You have that kind of meet and greet and the exchange words and Putin says, thank you for
*  coming.
*  Welcome to Moscow.
*  Thank you for coming.
*  And Lukashenko says to Putin, what choice did I have?
*  And so this is shown on television.
*  That's the part that they show, not the part that they conceal.
*  And so the guy's trading water and he intervenes in this crisis just very shrewdly and makes
*  himself indispensable and potentially acquires the militia part of Wagner for Belarus.
*  Moreover, he's now, everyone saw that Lukashenko saved the situation in Russia.
*  So rather than Lukashenko being under Putin's boot, now there's a quasi sense that Putin
*  was at least dependent in this episode on Lukashenko.
*  So that was quite a reversal of fortune, very clever intervention.
*  We'll get the details eventually.
*  Be careful.
*  A lot of the details are going to be fake, but we'll be able to sort it out eventually.
*  But I did not have Lukashenko being this clever.
*  I thought he was in bigger trouble and would muff this and would come out worse as a result
*  of this.
*  But he's the one that's come out looking the best.
*  And so where this is going, once again, I don't know the future and I don't have full
*  information and we want to be as humble as possible in discussing what could happen further
*  here.
*  One thing that's happened so far is that Lukashenko has returned the tables on Putin in terms
*  of his own dependency, at least in the short term.
*  And so if there's a winner here, and generally speaking, I don't think there are any winners
*  yet.
*  I mean, we'll get to the Ukrainian battlefield and counteroffensive at some point, I'm sure.
*  But Lukashenko comes out looking a lot better than I had him for.
*  And so I stand corrected on that.
*  Why didn't Putin smoke this guy?
*  Pregozhin.
*  Putin's got tremendous assets in the military sense.
*  He's got everything he would have needed to smoke this guy.
*  And he didn't.
*  And what does that mean?
*  A lot of people speculating.
*  Does it mean it's because Putin was uncertain of the reaction?
*  That he would give the order and the military wouldn't implement it?
*  Or that he would kill this guy and this guy would become a martyr and a hero and worse
*  in death than he is in life?
*  I don't know the answer to that.
*  Those speculations to me are worthy of keeping an eye on.
*  The other piece of this is that when they were marching on Moscow, they didn't galvanize
*  the rest of the Russian military.
*  In other words, the death squads, the special forces, the militia that Pregozhin controlled,
*  known as the Wagner Group, wasn't gaining size like a snowball running downhill as it
*  was marching.
*  And so neither side, as it were, galvanized the public or galvanized the security and
*  military structures.
*  So it was a kind of standoff that neither side was sure that they could win or neither
*  let's say was confident in the potential outcome.
*  Now Putin, allegedly, according to reports tracking the airplanes, his plane took off
*  and he went to Valdai, which is a presidential retreat between Moscow and St. Petersburg.
*  It's possible the planes took off.
*  It's also possible Putin wasn't on them.
*  His planes are traveling in multiple directions all the time in order to scramble people not
*  knowing where he's located at any given time.
*  So did he flee Moscow?
*  Did he flee the Kremlin or his dacha outside Moscow?
*  Let's wait to see if we get more hard information on that.
*  But clearly didn't rally.
*  But to go back to the point, Ezra, about the levers of power.
*  So Putin has a Praetorian Guard.
*  They're very, very substantial.
*  He's got his own Wagner Group equivalents.
*  One of them is the so-called FSO, which is the old bodyguard directorate of the KGB,
*  the directorate that guarded Gorbachev, the Politburo members.
*  It was split off as a self-standing organization and it's colossal.
*  Exactly how many soldiers does it have?
*  I'm not sure.
*  20,000, 30,000.
*  I've seen different estimates from people that I trust who have good information.
*  But whatever the number is, it's big.
*  And there's this guy, Kocniev, who's in charge.
*  He's a general, he's in charge.
*  And they look like they are loyal to Putin right down the line.
*  There's another group called the National Guard, which is run by this guy, Zolotov.
*  Zolotov was Yeltsin's bodyguard and was on the tank in 1991, if you know that famous
*  picture of Yeltsin opposing the coup attempt by the security forces in summer of 1991,
*  just before the Soviet final collapse.
*  And Yeltsin was up on that tank and Zolotov was Yeltsin's bodyguard and is on the tank.
*  He then became eventually a bodyguard for Putin and now he is the general in charge
*  of the National Guard.
*  So you have the federal bodyguard directorate and you've the FSO and you've got the National
*  Guard.
*  And so you've got these two really, really big militias that are as loyal as loyal can be.
*  So that's a lot of protection.
*  That's a nice cocoon to be living in.
*  And if those guys don't defect, if those guys don't turn on you, it's very hard to bring
*  this regime down because you can't get near the actual regime because it's in this cocoon.
*  And so the machinations about whether to take Prugosian out or not, we still don't know.
*  The skirmish that took place outside the city of Voronezh, which is between Rostov.
*  Rostov is the city in the south where Prugosian was holed up in a bunker.
*  The military headquarters of the Russian war, aggression against Ukraine is in Rostov and
*  that's where Prugosian was in a bunker.
*  He didn't go to Moscow himself.
*  He sent several thousand fighters, five thousand, eight thousand.
*  We've seen different numbers.
*  There was a skirmish outside Voronezh, which is between Rostov and Moscow.
*  So it's on the way to Moscow, much closer to Moscow.
*  But it's not clear what the circumstances of that skirmish involved because it looks
*  like there were some helicopters that the Wagner guys shot down, but those helicopters
*  were not attacking them.
*  They were conducting surveillance over the march.
*  Kind of like when they tell you that things on the goannas are sluggish.
*  They're looking at the traffic above New York City to try to advise people on their commute
*  of all the idiotic roads to beyond, which is the least idiotic.
*  So they're watching with the helicopters and the Wagner guys just shoot the helicopters
*  down because they don't know that the helicopters are just there for surveillance.
*  And then a couple of planes also seem to have been shot down.
*  It's not clear, once again, quite what those planes were doing, but it looks to be the
*  case that they were not attacking the Wagner guys.
*  So even the one area where there was a skirmish does not look like it was a two-sided skirmish.
*  It looks like one side opened fire on the other without knowing what the other was up
*  to.
*  And so I know it's hard to understand, but the uncertainty of the moment, the fact that
*  we're not sure if killing Prokoshen is more beneficial, less beneficial to the Putin regime
*  because he could be a martyr.
*  And on it goes.
*  This uncertainty is typical.
*  There's a lack of decisiveness in the last many years of Putin's rule, kind of out to
*  lunch complacent, procrastinating, not making decisions and letting things hopefully resolve
*  themselves naturally, kind of out to lunch, disengaged.
*  In the early years, Putin would have prided himself on shooting things down, on killing
*  people, on showing just how tough he was.
*  We saw that in those Chechen wars when he first came to power.
*  It's a different regime now, but I think it's more the uncertainty that was built into the
*  situation as much as it was a lack of decisiveness.
*  We don't know if he gave an order that wasn't implemented.
*  We don't know with whom he was in contact.
*  And the Lukashenko intervention, as I said, also might have changed the equation because
*  you saw the press reports that Lukashenko blabbed.
*  We have no idea if this is true, but he blabbed that he talked Putin out of using force to
*  kill these guys.
*  That could be just Lukashenko talking out of his, well, I won't say it.
*  This is a family show, but you understand which part of the anatomy I have in mind here.
*  And so a lot of uncertainty, but the main issue remains that Putin lost the aura, has
*  huge levers of power and loyalists, and is seen as the only alternative so far to the
*  abyss.
*  Right as this crisis was ongoing, resolving itself, Politico ran a good feature where
*  they asked, I think it was 14 Russia watchers, what they thought.
*  And this goes, I think, to the point you're making there.
*  But I was so struck by the range of opinion from this regime is rotting, Putin is vulnerable,
*  this shows he's losing power, losing control, the elites are fractious, all the way to this
*  doesn't matter.
*  The pergosian was not moving on Putin, it was a last ditch effort that maybe this even
*  strengthens Putin by bringing the military closer to him, maybe he cracks down on the
*  elites, maybe he doubles down in Ukraine.
*  And these are all people who are knowledgeable and have watched Russian politics for a long
*  time.
*  So I won't ask you to try to have an answer where one can't emerge or one can't be held
*  solidly.
*  But what kinds of information or what kinds of signals would you be looking for in the
*  coming months to see if something has changed to see if there are more cracks or more difficulty
*  for Putin in managing the sort of elite coalition around him or to see if he is as in control
*  as ever?
*  Yeah, as a result, if he uses somebody as the main instrument to crack down, in other
*  The problem with that is the person who puts the lid back on is immediately in everybody's
*  eyes an alternative to Putin.
*  Not an alternative on the democratic opposition side, but an alternative on the regime side,
*  where it really counts.
*  And so he's kind of stuck here.
*  It's very paradoxical.
*  He needs to put the lid back on.
*  He needs to reassert his power.
*  It can't be just the speech.
*  He's made a couple of speeches already.
*  The speeches have no effect, even with all the choreography that the manipulators, the
*  spin doctors at the Kremlin can come up with.
*  And they got a lot of great stuff ready.
*  He was in front of the Palace of the Facets, one of Ivan the Terrible's palaces inside
*  the Kremlin.
*  He walked down the red carpet.
*  You could see the Palace of Facets right off to his left shoulder.
*  It was tremendous imagery, but it's really just imagery on TV and then it passes.
*  And so how does he put the lid back on?
*  Heads have to roll.
*  Well, if heads roll, who's going to take their place?
*  And if the people who take their place are competent people, then why don't they take
*  the president's place?
*  So in some ways that helps explain how Lukashenko could insert himself successfully.
*  We know he tried to insert himself, but how was he successful?
*  It's because maybe Putin saw that empowering the Belarusian dictator was less empowering
*  domestically in Russia than anybody he would have tasked with putting the lid on at home.
*  So there's that.
*  There's watching the empowerment or refusal to empower somebody to put the lid back on
*  and how Putin manages to put the lid back on.
*  Then there's the unraveling or unraveling of the Wagner global empire.
*  Can Putin successfully bring that home, as it were, without Progosian?
*  And if so, who gets it?
*  Does it go to Shoigu, the failed minister of defense?
*  Does it go to Zolotov, the head of the National Guard, who has a militia but doesn't have
*  the kind of businesses that Progosian built because he's not on that level?
*  So that's something else to watch.
*  Other things to watch, of course, are the domestic fiscal situation.
*  It looks like they've managed pretty well to not crash the economy and do much better
*  than all the economists' predictions and expectations in terms of GDP decline and instability and
*  macroeconomic instability.
*  They've done pretty well.
*  How long does that go on?
*  The gulf between the revenues and the expenses has widened very, very significantly.
*  This is all about a bank run in the economic sense, not in the political sense, meaning
*  if depositors in Russia think that they're going to lose their money, they're going to
*  try to get their money before they lose it, which will create the situation of them losing
*  their money, which also could crash the regime from a fiscal macroeconomic point of view.
*  So that's a major point of vulnerability.
*  The main thing to watch, of course, is the front, is the battlefield in Ukraine.
*  So the Ukrainian counteroffensive has the potential to destabilize, maybe even cause
*  a battlefield bank run with the Russian army, which would have consequences potentially,
*  not automatically, but potentially in Moscow.
*  So far, the Russian side of the battlefield is held really well.
*  That's both before the pre-Goshen events and since.
*  It's very early yet.
*  A lot of people who know much more about military matters than I know, I've talked to them and
*  they are convinced that Ukraine can do this, not that they will succeed, but they can potentially
*  succeed that there will be multiple counteroffenses, not just one, that this will be a longer protracted
*  process potentially, and we should be less eager for results every minute while we're
*  refreshing our screens.
*  Because General Kovolny, who is the supreme commander of Europe for the United States
*  and the supreme commander of NATO, and it's playing a very big role as a partner to the
*  Ukrainians, as he told me not that long ago, Ukraine doesn't have to be the best army
*  in the world.
*  They just have to be the best army in Ukraine.
*  And if that turns out to be the case, that could have political repercussions in Moscow.
*  It's not automatic.
*  Putin could ride out even a lost war.
*  The problem with Ukrainian successes is Putin's capabilities to lash out, not on a global
*  scale with strategic nuclear weapons, but on the scale of Ukraine.
*  I worry about this more than anything else.
*  You see, Russia doesn't need Ukraine.
*  Ukraine needs Ukraine.
*  And Putin's strategy has amounted to a failure, but he's now got a backup plan.
*  And that backup plan is, well, I can't have Ukraine.
*  Nobody can have Ukraine.
*  And so we saw him blow up the dam on the Dnieper River, which was extraordinary.
*  And people thought, oh, you know, he did that in order to blunt the Ukrainian offensive.
*  It had next to no impact on the front line on the Ukrainian side.
*  And so you got to see that that's a message.
*  He's telling you that he's bombing the residences, he's bombing the schools, he's bombing the
*  hospitals.
*  They're committing rapes and other atrocities.
*  They're destroying or looting Ukrainian cultural artifacts.
*  That's what this is about now.
*  I can't have it.
*  OK, nobody can have it.
*  And so you're looking at that Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, pretty much on the same
*  location as the river, just a little bit more upriver.
*  And you're thinking, oh my God, if it goes up in smoke like the dam, what happens to
*  Ukraine?
*  He can irradiate Ukraine without even using a nuclear weapon for generations, kind of
*  Chernobyl style, but deliberately rather than accidentally.
*  I'm not saying he's going to do that.
*  I have no idea what his plans and intentions are, but he has that capability.
*  And that worries me because you can win the war and you win back territory and it's
*  irradiated.
*  And so we have to take those capabilities out of his hand.
*  Let's end then on the point of how Ukraine could get some of the capabilities that would
*  take some of those capabilities out of Putin's hand.
*  And a lot of that comes from the calibration of Western support and material and money
*  and industrial capacity.
*  And so far, there's been no evidence that the events of the Wagner Mutiny had any real
*  effect on Russian battlefield presence.
*  But a world in which the West sees Putin's regime is under more stress, as beginning
*  pressure of flailing about in Ukraine is plausibly a world where there's more Western commitment.
*  I mean, there has been a fair amount of Western commitment to Ukraine, but it is always calibrated.
*  They're always giving just enough and no more.
*  They're not giving the thing Ukraine would really like to have on the battlefield.
*  And they give some of that, but not the next thing.
*  And one plausible consequence of this is a sense in the West that maybe this is working.
*  Maybe Ukraine has a better shot of, to some degree, pushing the regime into crisis in
*  a way that would be a meaningful outcome for them.
*  Do you think that's true?
*  We hear every day that the world order is at stake in Ukraine.
*  And yet we also hear at the same time that we can't put any of our soldiers or NATO soldiers
*  into Ukraine.
*  So we've done quite a lot, an extraordinary amount.
*  And it's been fantastic because the Ukrainians have made the sacrifices that they've made.
*  And they've used our stuff, but they've used also the vast majority of what they've used
*  successfully has been Soviet era kit, Soviet era weaponry that's sure has been rejiggered,
*  has been improved.
*  Also the drones that the Ukrainians themselves rejigger in order to carry grenades.
*  They need to evade the Russian electronic jamming and everything.
*  It's been extraordinary what they've accomplished and our support for it.
*  And it's inspiring to see that.
*  It's inspiring to see the revival of the West.
*  Yes, there is now a renewed sense that Ukraine can do this just like there was after the
*  Kharkiv offensive, which was another success on the Ukrainian side that happened in an
*  earlier phase of the war where they pushed the Russians out of that big province around
*  the city of Kharkiv.
*  And people said, Oh, Ukraine can win this.
*  Now we should support them even more.
*  That's just not a way to understand this.
*  This is the ninth year of the war going back to 2014 when Putin took Crimea and then not
*  long after that supported or instigated the uprising in Eastern Ukraine, so-called Donbass.
*  This is a generational problem where Ukraine has to win the peace over the long haul.
*  Winning the peace means not just preserving the existence of your nation and the sovereignty
*  of your state.
*  That's what Ukraine has achieved so far.
*  It means joining the West, becoming a Western-oriented, Western-integrated, prosperous, non-corrupt
*  rule of law, democratic society with a dynamic new economy, not the old Soviet-style economy
*  of heavy metal that they had before.
*  That's not a one-day or a one-week or a one-counteroffensive or a one-year proposition.
*  That's a multi-year proposition.
*  Here the conundrum of Crimea will come into play, which is a almost exclusively Russian
*  ethnic area that Ukraine is trying to reclaim since it was illegally annexed by Russia.
*  We have questions like that.
*  Alexei Navalny, the opposition figure in Russia who is in prison now and looks like he's going
*  to get his prison term extended even more on fabricated charges.
*  Navalny has said that Crimea is Russian territory.
*  Boris Yeltsin, before Putin, demanded Crimea back from Ukraine.
*  How Ukraine lives alongside Russia, how they win the peace, how they are able to join the
*  West, get a security guarantee, enter the European Union.
*  For all its faults, the European Union is the best path forward for Ukraine, and they
*  would all recognize that as victory, winning the peace.
*  How all of that happens over the generations so that this doesn't happen again two years
*  from now, ten years from now, twenty years from now.
*  We want a situation in which Russia is not incentivized to do this again, whether that's
*  under the Putin regime or after.
*  A victory on the battlefield in the short term, taking back some territory, reclaiming territory
*  that's of course ruined, it's completely flattened, it's rubble, getting the refugees back into
*  the country, getting the Ukrainian children back in Ukrainian language schools from abroad.
*  All of that is critical for the survival of Ukraine going forward.
*  But what's also critical is they're going to live next to Russia, and Russia's not going
*  anywhere.
*  You can't pick up Russia and move it to the other side of China.
*  And so you can arm yourself to the teeth, porcupine style, maybe.
*  Someone's got to pay for that.
*  And that also has repercussions on your domestic institutions, on your liberty.
*  And I could go on.
*  And so being a state that's a garrison state has many domestic implications that we should
*  be careful about encouraging.
*  Russia needs to have a stake in the international system in some fashion.
*  It can't be incentivized only for spoliation, only for wreaking havoc, only for doing nasty
*  things out of spite, whether it's to Ukraine or to somebody else.
*  Russia is in terminal decline right now.
*  They are on a pathway.
*  They're so weak.
*  And in order to overcome their weakness, they're making themselves even weaker.
*  Putin is achieving the exact opposite aims that he set out to achieve.
*  Gorbachev did the same thing.
*  Gorbachev set out to make Russia stronger, and he made it weaker.
*  He did it with a bet on the West, partnership with the West.
*  Putin started out with the partnership with the West.
*  Eventually, he decided it was anti-Westernism that he would make the big bet on.
*  But either way, Putin has done even more damage to Russia's strategic position than Gorbachev
*  ever did, unwittingly.
*  And so Russia has just too many capabilities and its geography, and I could go on, for
*  it to be completely outside the international system.
*  It's committed these crimes.
*  I understand that it needs to pay the price for those crimes.
*  I'm just worried that we have to understand better how to win the peace over the generations.
*  I think that's a good place to end.
*  So then, always our final question.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  Oh my god, only three?
*  Seriously, Ezra?
*  I apologize.
*  I read about 120 books a year on average, unless I get distracted.
*  Let's do one in biography.
*  I would probably recommend the John Richardson Picasso, but it's four volumes.
*  So let's leave that aside.
*  Let's do the Jackie Wulschlager, a Chagall biography.
*  It's my favorite biography in the arts.
*  I'm writing a biography myself of an artist, well, of a political artist in a way.
*  And so I'm very favorably disposed towards great biographies.
*  And Chagall is from Vitebsk, and that happens to be the city where my father's side of the
*  family is from.
*  If you know those Chagall paintings of those peasants flying in the air out of the village,
*  that's my family.
*  Anyway, Wulschlager's Chagall is great.
*  I do a lot of stuff on China.
*  I read just about every book on China.
*  A very hard decision here.
*  I wish I could mention a hundred of them.
*  I won't do Eric Schwartzle's Red Carpet, which is one of my favorites because I've done that
*  on someone else's podcast.
*  So I'll do Scott Rosell, Invisible China.
*  I think that's the China book that your listeners would learn the most from of all the China
*  books because it's just so unexpected and it's so data rich, Invisible China.
*  And then third, let's do American history or American policy.
*  We live in America.
*  I try to keep up.
*  Teka Hema-Linen's Indigenous Continent.
*  I won't do that here because I did that on a previous podcast.
*  So I'll go for David Bernstein, Classified, which is the untold story of racial classification
*  in America, which is also full of incredible surprises and is right on point for where
*  we are in the culture today.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  I've never heard the strategy before, but it worked well of saying I'm not going to
*  do this book, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, but here's a book I'm recommending.
*  Nice way to expand the ambit there.
*  Stephen Kotkin, thank you very, very much.
*  Ezra, it was my pleasure.
