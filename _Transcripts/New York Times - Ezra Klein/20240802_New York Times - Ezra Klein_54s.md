*  inability to connect like a human being on any way and I made the kiss see if
*  you're seeing laugh he doesn't laugh unless he's laughing at someone and what
*  happened was the minute that spell came down the minute everybody in the crowd
*  realized the Emperor wasn't wearing any clothes we can sweep in and say who's
*  asking to ban birth control who's asking to ban these books who's asking to take
*  veterans benefits away and then we come in and say look Kamala Harris is talking
*  about making sure that you have expanded health care making sure there's daycare
*  available making sure that it's easier to get free school lunches they're
*  talking about a national level that's where that came from and weird is it's
