# The Republican Party’s NPC Problem — and Ours | The Ezra Klein Show
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM)
*  A few years back, the online right became enamored of a new epithet for liberals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=0.0s)]
*  NPC, short for Non-Player Character. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=4.8s)]
*  Non-Playable Character. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=7.44s)]
*  Non-Player Character. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=8.44s)]
*  What, you don't know about this? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=9.44s)]
*  Do I get to tell you the NPC meme? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=10.44s)]
*  This is the most important meme for a lifetime. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=11.92s)]
*  The term was lifted from video games, where an NPC refers to the computer-controlled characters [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=13.76s)]
*  that populate the game while you, the live player, make actual decisions. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=18.32s)]
*  NPCs don't have minds of their own. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=22.72s)]
*  They don't have agency. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=25.2s)]
*  They're automatons. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=26.68s)]
*  You might have seen these memes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=29.08s)]
*  Featureless gray faces, sometimes surrounded by liberal icons. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Elon Musk loved posting them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=34.92s)]
*  Liberals in this story thought what they were allowed to think. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=37.56s)]
*  Said what they were allowed to say. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=41.08s)]
*  And once you identify it, it's like the Matrix. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Like you see Agent Smith everywhere. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=45.16s)]
*  Believe all women. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=46.68s)]
*  Refugees welcome. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=48.44s)]
*  I anticipate that's going to be the new NPC download. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=50.0s)]
*  Foreign Snapchat. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=53.56s)]
*  Inversive-type stuff. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=55.64s)]
*  Like any good insult, the NPC meme served a dual purpose. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=58.24s)]
*  It contains a kernel of truth about its target. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=61.84s)]
*  We liberals can be conformist. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=64.8s)]
*  We can be too afraid to offend. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=66.92s)]
*  We can be overly deferential to institutions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=69.08s)]
*  We can be cowed by the in-group policing that we inflict on ourselves. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=72.08s)]
*  And a little quick to take up whatever the cause of the moment is. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=75.28s)]
*  But the real purpose of the NPC insult was self-congratulation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=80.12s)]
*  The rite was full of live players. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=84.2s)]
*  You could see it in their willingness to offend. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=85.8s)]
*  What is a woman? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=88.84s)]
*  Can you tell me that? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=89.84s)]
*  I'll say what I want to say and if the consequence of that is losing money, so be it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=90.84s)]
*  Their mistrust of institutions. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=94.88s)]
*  Are you a conspiracy theorist? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  That is a pejorative, Senator, that's applied to me. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=99.72s)]
*  Mainly to keep me from asking difficult questions of powerful interest. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  I'll say it again. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=108.8s)]
*  Do your own research. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=110.0s)]
*  Their eagerness to debate what liberals would not even say out loud. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=111.72s)]
*  It depends on what you mean by equality. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=115.84s)]
*  You know, just shut up and obey. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=117.76s)]
*  I just reject that completely. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=118.76s)]
*  This became part of the Trumpist rite's self-definition. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=121.0s)]
*  They were the non-conformists. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=123.4s)]
*  We are now the party of freedom and the party of speech. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=126.0s)]
*  The coalition that wasn't made of automatons. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=130.0s)]
*  In fact, we are just the f***ing party. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=132.76s)]
*  And that's what America needed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=135.92s)]
*  Live players. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=137.96s)]
*  And here we are in 2025. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=139.72s)]
*  And at this point, I'm willing to concede at least half the argument. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=141.08s)]
*  American politics does have an NPC problem. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=144.72s)]
*  Possibly a lethal one. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=147.4s)]
*  But it's not on the left. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=148.72000000000003s)]
*  I can make a generous case for a lot of what the Trump administration is on some level [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=151.52s)]
*  trying to do or at least saying they're trying to do. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=157.70000000000002s)]
*  Government is too gummed up by process and protocol. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=161.28s)]
*  It is too hard to hire and fire in a civil service. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=163.88000000000002s)]
*  Even if I agree with the goals of many DEI programs, and I do, many of them don't achieve [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=167.68s)]
*  those goals. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=172.32s)]
*  Some of them make the problems they seek to fix worse. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=173.32s)]
*  There hasn't been rigor at looking at which is which and getting rid of the bad ones. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=175.36s)]
*  There is actually a good argument for auditing USAID. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=180.56s)]
*  We probably should convert more of what that agency spends to cash grants and direct public [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=184.0s)]
*  health support. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=188.10000000000002s)]
*  And yes, how the government manages software procurement and bills and maintains digital [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=189.10000000000002s)]
*  services is hopelessly cumbersome. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=193.44s)]
*  I was saying all this before the election, too. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  All of it is well known, including among liberals. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=199.36s)]
*  Many liberals have spent a lot of time trying to think about how to fix these problems. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=202.52s)]
*  And so it is a genuine failure of Democrats that they did not put more energy into making [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=205.7s)]
*  the government faster and better and more responsive when they were in charge. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=210.52s)]
*  How the hell did the Biden administration pass $42 billion for broadband in 2021? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=215.6s)]
*  Let us agree in the 21st century in America, high speed Internet is not a luxury. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=221.48s)]
*  It is a necessity. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=229.0s)]
*  And have basically nothing to show for it by November of 2024. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=230.0s)]
*  That is a Wawa station back there behind me. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  They recently got $733,000 to build an EV charging station. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  Unfortunately, you see right now are gas pumps, though. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=243.6s)]
*  How did they get $7.5 billion for electric vehicle chargers but only build a few hundred [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=246.94s)]
*  of them by the end of their term? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=251.62s)]
*  It seems that everything is going a little slower than anybody thought. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=253.98s)]
*  Why is it all so slow? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=258.46s)]
*  Democrats became champions of a government that often didn't work. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=260.7s)]
*  And that's part of the reason Trump won. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=263.94s)]
*  Not the only reason, not the biggest reason. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=266.52s)]
*  It's not as important as a price of eggs. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=269.22s)]
*  But when people feel the government isn't working, the party promising change beats [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=271.65999999999997s)]
*  a party rallying in defense. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=276.09999999999997s)]
*  When Elon Musk says that the election gave Republicans a mandate for reform, he's not [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=278.74s)]
*  totally wrong. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=283.62s)]
*  You couldn't ask for a stronger mandate from the public. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=285.26s)]
*  You have a majority of the public vote voting for President Trump. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=288.02s)]
*  We won the House, we won the Senate. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=291.46s)]
*  The people voted for major government reform. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=296.58s)]
*  There should be no doubt about that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=301.06s)]
*  But look at how Musk justifies that mandate. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=302.78s)]
*  The proof is that Republicans control the House and the Senate. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=306.14s)]
*  So why not write some bills? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=310.34s)]
*  Sure, Republican majorities are narrow, but bipartisanship here, it wasn't out of the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=311.73999999999995s)]
*  question. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=316.7s)]
*  Democrats were defeated and ready to deal. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=317.7s)]
*  Their own voters wanted them to deal. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=319.61999999999995s)]
*  A January poll by CBS and YouGov found that 54% of Democrats wanted their congressional [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=321.97999999999996s)]
*  representatives to work with the Trump administration. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=327.38s)]
*  One month later, February, and now 65% want all out opposition. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=330.98s)]
*  That is a lot of political capital the Trump administration burnt in just one month. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  And for what? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=342.42s)]
*  I've covered Washington for decades now. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=343.42s)]
*  There's gray in the spirit. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=347.14000000000004s)]
*  If this was about policy, Trump and his team would have gone through Congress. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=348.86s)]
*  They could have crafted much larger reforms using a wider set of powers, and they wouldn't [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=353.90000000000003s)]
*  be facing down the courts in the way they are now. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=358.66s)]
*  But what they wanted wasn't policy. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=360.94s)]
*  They didn't want to go line by line through USAID and figure out what worked and what [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=364.06s)]
*  didn't. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=367.86s)]
*  They didn't want to think through new civil service regulations, balancing ethics and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=368.86s)]
*  independence and responsiveness. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=372.38s)]
*  What they wanted was power. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=374.5s)]
*  What Donald Trump wanted was power. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=377.3s)]
*  And so they're trying to remake our system of government, not our laws. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=379.7s)]
*  And they've identified a weak point in the system. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=383.66s)]
*  And now they're trying to drive a flaming cyber truck through it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=386.3s)]
*  That weak point is Congress. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=389.98s)]
*  And the reason the Trump administration might succeed in taking Congress's power is that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=391.98s)]
*  they have turned congressional Republicans into NPCs. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=397.02000000000004s)]
*  The vulnerability in the system here goes way back. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=401.3s)]
*  In Federalist 51, James Madison set out the challenge he and his colleagues faced in writing [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=405.18s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=409.06s)]
*  He said, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=411.02s)]
*  So how does a government control itself? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=425.54s)]
*  The Founder's idea was that it controls itself through internal competition between independent [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=428.9s)]
*  branches, each of which wants to protect its own power. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=433.78s)]
*  Competition must be made to counteract ambition, Madison wrote. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=438.7s)]
*  But one branch was unquestionably designed to be stronger than the others. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  Congress controls the money. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=448.46s)]
*  Congress can overturn presidential vetoes. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=449.97999999999996s)]
*  Congress can impeach federal judges, cabinet officers, and the president. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=452.9s)]
*  Why was Congress made so strong? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=457.41999999999996s)]
*  Because Congress reflects a second, and in some ways the more important and enduring, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=459.76s)]
*  form of fracture the Founders imagined. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=464.34s)]
*  Our political system was designed to fracture power by place. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=466.76s)]
*  Senators are elected by states. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  The House is sliced up into geographically bound districts. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=473.08s)]
*  That ultimately is what members of Congress are supposed to represent. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=477.52s)]
*  The particular needs of a particular group of voters in a particular place. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=480.92s)]
*  And so power would be fractured. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=485.84s)]
*  It can never nationalize into just one force. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=487.36s)]
*  The framers of the Constitution got a lot right. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=491.8s)]
*  They got a lot wrong. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=495.04s)]
*  And one of the big things they got wrong was visible almost immediately. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=496.68s)]
*  The Founders imagined a political system free of political parties. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=500.98s)]
*  But for much of American history, their second assumption held. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=505.64s)]
*  Geography kept American politics fractured. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=509.68s)]
*  It kept power fractured. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=512.04s)]
*  Because it kept America's political parties fractured. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=514.32s)]
*  Yes, we've had Republicans and Democrats for a long time. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=517.16s)]
*  But in the 20th century, that two party system was really a four party system. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=521.74s)]
*  The Democrats were split between the liberals we know today and the Southern Dixiecrats. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=526.22s)]
*  A sort of internal party whose primary goal was upholding segregation. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=530.94s)]
*  The Republicans were split between conservatives as we know them today and northern liberals. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=535.86s)]
*  It is astonishing from our vantage point to really wrap your mind around this. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=541.3s)]
*  But it's true for much of the 20th century. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=545.66s)]
*  To say you were a Republican or a Democrat didn't reveal whether you were a liberal or conservative. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=548.1s)]
*  In 1973, Senator Joe Biden opposed the Roe v. Wade decision. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=554.78s)]
*  Around that same time, President Richard Nixon proposed a universal health care bill [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=560.66s)]
*  and created the Environmental Protection Agency. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=565.5s)]
*  The time has come for man to make his peace with nature. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=568.34s)]
*  Politics was different then. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=573.5400000000001s)]
*  The parties were different then. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=575.3000000000001s)]
*  Because parties that contained so many different places and ideologies could not act in lockstep. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=577.46s)]
*  And so bipartisanship was common. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=583.26s)]
*  There's warm applause from members of both parties as the president sets to work. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=585.26s)]
*  The Civil Rights Act of 1964, yes, it was pushed by a Democratic president. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=589.14s)]
*  But Congressional Republicans were crucial to its passage. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=594.02s)]
*  Souvenirs go to Republican leader Everett Turkson and Democratic whip Hubert Humphrey. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=596.86s)]
*  When Nixon was refusing to spend money that Congress had appropriated, a policy known as impoundment, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=603.98s)]
*  Congress acted to protect its power, Republicans and Democrats alike. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=609.62s)]
*  The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 passed the House with only six no votes, only six. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=614.1400000000001s)]
*  It passed the Senate without a single vote in opposition. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=621.22s)]
*  When Watergate began coming to light, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=624.9000000000001s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=626.94s)]
*  I want to talk to you tonight from my heart. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=628.58s)]
*  It was ultimately a delegation of Congressional Republicans that persuaded Nixon to resign. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=631.6999999999999s)]
*  Senator Scott and I have just concluded a visit with the president. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=636.62s)]
*  He invited us down this afternoon to disclose to him what we feel the actual conditions in the House and the Senate are [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=640.86s)]
*  relative to his situation. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=650.42s)]
*  But that was then. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=655.9399999999999s)]
*  Here in 2025, President Trump is impounding money that Congress has appropriated in clear defiance of that [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=658.3s)]
*  impoundment bill that passed nearly unanimously. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=664.38s)]
*  He's trying to erase agencies that Congress created. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=667.2199999999999s)]
*  And while the courts are standing in his way, Congress is doing nothing while Trump takes away their power. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=670.54s)]
*  The reason USAID is going to cease to exist as it did before is because it should. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=676.6999999999999s)]
*  At the end of the day, though, he's got to freeze everything in order to get his arms around it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=682.86s)]
*  Just give him a little time. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=688.34s)]
*  We don't see this as a threat to Article 1 at all. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=689.7s)]
*  We see this as an active, engaged, committed executive branch authority doing what the executive branch should do. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=691.86s)]
*  It's astonishing. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=699.9000000000001s)]
*  Republicans in Congress could demand that Trump cut them in. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=702.0200000000001s)]
*  They won this election, too. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=704.94s)]
*  This is their job. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=706.58s)]
*  It is their job to write these bills. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=707.58s)]
*  Agreeing with Trump's policy aims need not mean agreeing with his power grab. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=710.42s)]
*  The most powerful branch of government, the branch with the power to check the others, is supine. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=715.86s)]
*  It is not that it can't act to protect its power. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=721.82s)]
*  It's that it will not act to protect its power. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=724.66s)]
*  This is a non-player Congress. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=727.34s)]
*  What we are seeing is a collapse of the constitutional structure and the nationalization of the two parties. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=730.26s)]
*  If Democrats controlled Congress right now, yeah, Congress would be a check on Donald Trump. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=737.38s)]
*  Since Republicans control it, it is not. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=742.0600000000001s)]
*  What matters is which party controls it and how that party acts. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=745.38s)]
*  It is parties that now compete with each other, not branches. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=749.26s)]
*  Parties are institutions. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=753.26s)]
*  They can be more or less responsible. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=755.46s)]
*  They can themselves be a check on abuses, even on their own side. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=757.6600000000001s)]
*  I already talked about how Republicans were a check on Nixon. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=761.58s)]
*  In 2005, President George W. Bush nominated his White House counsel, Harriet Meyers, to the Supreme Court. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=764.62s)]
*  I asked the Senate to review her qualifications thoroughly and fairly and to vote on her nomination promptly. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=770.42s)]
*  And she had to withdraw because the Republican-controlled Senate found her unqualified and ideologically unreliable. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=777.42s)]
*  The fact that Bush wanted her on the court, that wasn't enough. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=785.14s)]
*  Congress Republicans had their own views. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=788.22s)]
*  In 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Tom Daschle to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=790.6999999999999s)]
*  Tom Daschle is one of America's foremost health care experts. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=796.18s)]
*  Only to see Daschle withdraw. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=799.86s)]
*  Daschle, who was a former majority leader of the U.S. Senate, was found to owe back taxes. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=801.78s)]
*  And he thought his own nomination might fail to make it through a Senate filled with his former colleagues. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=806.98s)]
*  But this Republican party is no check on Trump. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=812.78s)]
*  That's been the message of Trump's nominations. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=815.9399999999999s)]
*  RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Cash Patel, Pete Hegseth. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=818.3s)]
*  These were tests. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=821.9399999999999s)]
*  Senate Republicans know these nominees are unqualified. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=823.58s)]
*  You could see it in the hearings. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=826.74s)]
*  Again, let's make it very clear for everyone here today. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=828.5s)]
*  As Secretary of Defense, will you support women continuing to have the opportunity to serve in combat roles? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=832.86s)]
*  As the leader of the intelligence community, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=840.9399999999999s)]
*  how would you think you would be received based on some of these past actions to support or even to pardon Edward Snowden? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=844.34s)]
*  I'm a doc. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=852.22s)]
*  Convince me that you will become the public health advocate, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=852.9s)]
*  but not just churn old information so that there's never a conclusion. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=857.58s)]
*  Senate Republicans don't want to vote for these nominees. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=862.62s)]
*  Not one of them got into politics to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr., [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=866.18s)]
*  who ran for president in 2023, two years ago, as a pro-choice Democrat, as Secretary of Health and Human Services. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=871.02s)]
*  But Trump knows what he's doing. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=880.8199999999999s)]
*  You force people into submission early and soon it becomes a habit. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=882.66s)]
*  Congressional Republicans have their reasons for bowing to him. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=887.3s)]
*  Washington is aflame with talk of the primary challenges that Elon Musk will fund against any Republican who makes trouble for Trump. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=890.3s)]
*  All of them fear that Trump will personally weigh in against them in a primary. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=898.06s)]
*  What an unbelievably strange life to rise as far as they have in politics, to wield as much power as they could and to be as afraid as they are. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=901.54s)]
*  The NBC critique got something right. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=912.8199999999999s)]
*  There are real dangers to conformity. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=914.98s)]
*  Political parties, even presidential administrations, are stronger when they can hear contrary voices. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=917.42s)]
*  Musk using his billions to scare congressional Republicans into supporting everything Trump does. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=922.34s)]
*  Yeah, it makes Trump look stronger now. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=927.94s)]
*  It might make him and the country a whole lot weaker later if those same nominees fail and he is blamed for the disaster. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=930.26s)]
*  Or if the Treasury payment system breaks and he is blamed for the chaos. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=938.14s)]
*  In the short term, having unanimity makes you look strong. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=943.5400000000001s)]
*  In the long term, success is what makes you strong. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=947.02s)]
*  It would be good right now. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=950.34s)]
*  Good for their party, good for the country. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=952.22s)]
*  If Republicans display the values they once claimed to prize, a willingness to offend their own side, a mistrust of institutional authority, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=954.38s)]
*  an eagerness to debate the questions that those in power do not wish to see debated. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=963.6600000000001s)]
*  But we are seeing none of that. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=968.74s)]
*  This is the NBC problem we actually face. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=971.38s)]
*  A non-player Congress driven by Republicans who serve Trump's ambitions first. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lckYPwQj_NM&t=974.22s)]
