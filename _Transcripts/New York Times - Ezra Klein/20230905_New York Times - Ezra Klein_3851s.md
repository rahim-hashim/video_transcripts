# What Have We Learned From a Summer of Climate Reckoning?
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [September 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g23amgS49MM)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  Hey it is Ezra.
*  I am on book leave, but this week taking a turn at the mic is David Wallacewells.
*  He is a Times opinion writer.
*  He's the author of the Uninhabitable Earth, Life After Warming.
*  And I just think that over the past couple of years, not just his work on climate change
*  and biodiversity loss, but also his work particularly on COVID has been absolutely fantastic.
*  So I asked him to come on and do a couple shows around these themes.
*  I hope you enjoy.
*  From the perspective of the climate, it's been a hellish and disorienting summer.
*  This June was the hottest June on record.
*  July was the hottest July on record.
*  In Phoenix, all but one day in July crossed 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
*  The city's burn units were filling up with people who'd fainted on the street and been
*  burned by the asphalt, which measured as hot as 180 degrees.
*  Of course, it's not all bad news.
*  There is genuinely a green revolution underway, and it's moving much faster than what many
*  believed possible just a few years ago.
*  Emissions haven't yet begun to decline, but renewables are being rolled out at such a
*  pace and at such a low cost that many analysts believe will hit a carbon peak sometime this
*  decade.
*  Conventional modeling suggests that in just five years, we may have cut our expected warming
*  for this century almost in half.
*  But that doesn't mean we can declare victory.
*  Over the last decade, there's also been a flurry of new science showing that climate
*  risks we once expected in some worst-case scenarios may instead arrive with much less
*  warming.
*  And while all of those projections come wrapped in uncertainty, one worrying possibility is
*  that for all that rapid decarbonization, we may not end up on net in a much better place.
*  Which is all to say that thinking clearly about the state of climate change requires
*  now holding two pretty contradictory-seeming ideas in your head at once.
*  We're finally taking action, and quite rapidly.
*  But the planet is changing too, perhaps even more rapidly.
*  To help talk me through where we are today and where we're heading, there's no one I'd
*  want to speak to more than Dr. Kate Marvell, the Senior Climate Scientist at Project Drawdown.
*  She's just about the best person I know at holding those two different ideas in perspective
*  at once.
*  As always, you can email the show with your thoughts and guest recommendations at esraclineshow.nytimes.com.
*  Kate Marvell, welcome to the podcast.
*  Thank you so much for having me.
*  So we're talking in early August, which means a lot of the official July temperatures have
*  just sort of come in, and it looks like it was a really hot month.
*  I think the data I was looking at this morning said that we broke the previous record for
*  by 0.33c, which means we didn't just nudge the record up.
*  We broke it by like a quarter of all of the warming that we've ever done in human history
*  just this summer.
*  So I think in a certain way, it looks like a kind of a summer of climate reckoning or
*  climate awakening.
*  On the other hand, it seems like we sort of do this every summer.
*  Last year, we had extreme heat that killed 61,000 Europeans.
*  We had these dried riverbeds all across Europe, in the US too, and China.
*  And somehow this summer has felt to me at least a little bit different.
*  How has the summer looked to you?
*  I mean, the first thing that comes to mind when I think about this summer is how unsurprised
*  I am and how climate scientists were at least mentally prepared for extremely hot temperatures
*  this summer.
*  And that is because of two things.
*  That's because of climate change, and that's because of the El Nino conditions and the
*  tropical Pacific.
*  El Nino is a completely natural climate phenomenon that after the seasonal cycle is the primary
*  source of variability in the climate.
*  It's basically where you get warmer than average temperatures off the coast of Peru in the
*  equatorial Pacific.
*  And because the entire Earth system is connected, those have reverberations across the globe.
*  So we've got this El Nino condition, but it's nowhere near as strong as the strongest
*  El Ninos on record in 1998 and 2016.
*  Which means we think it's contributing less warming at this point than previous ones.
*  Yes.
*  And the really significant thing that it's overlaid on top of is climate change.
*  Just to pull back for a minute, I wanted to ask you a really big picture question, which
*  is, is warming speeding up?
*  This summer as we've been going through all of these sort of unusual events and trying
*  to make sense of them, there have also been a couple of assessments suggesting that over
*  the last decade, maybe the rate of warming is moving up a little, but then there are
*  other people looking at the data and saying it's quite a linear trend.
*  How do you assess the state of warming and what you think we might expect over the next
*  decade, which is likely to be defined not by dramatic emissions increases, not by dramatic
*  emissions decreases, but probably something like a plateau?
*  What are we looking at?
*  Are things getting warmer faster or are we basically moving forward at the same rate
*  we were before?
*  The short answer is I don't know.
*  The longer answer is probably 10 years ago, you would probably have been asking me is
*  warming slowing down.
*  And that's because following the massive El Nino event of 1998, you could, if you kind
*  of squinted, draw a line across global average temperatures that didn't look like it was
*  rising very much.
*  You can reassess the data and it looks like it's rising a little bit, but this led to
*  a lot of discourse about the so-called hiatus in warming.
*  You even had people on the floor of the Senate saying there hasn't been any global warming
*  for 10 years.
*  Where's your science now?
*  And the reason for that is that there was a small slowdown in the warming.
*  These decades can happen.
*  We can have hiatus decades.
*  We can have surge decades.
*  Which is just a reminder that these processes that we're talking about tend to play out
*  over very long periods of time.
*  And because we're humans with the lifespans that we have and because the story of the emissions
*  perturbation is the story that we have, which is depending on how you want to count a century
*  and a half or maybe even just a few decades old, we want to tell stories in really short
*  timeframes, but the climate system doesn't exactly cooperate.
*  Exactly.
*  So there's the role of internal variability where sometimes in the hiatus decades, so
*  following the big El Nino of 1998, we seem to have experienced cooler than average conditions
*  in the equatorial Pacific for an extended period of time.
*  Kind of a protracted opposite of El Nino, a La Nina-like state.
*  That gave rise to large cloud cover over those regions and that was a stabilizing feedback
*  that prevented lots of warming.
*  Those conditions are now gone.
*  And so there is an explanation where that is just internal variability.
*  Sometimes this happens, sometimes the reverse happens.
*  What for me is a much more interesting question is the different things that were, we call
*  it forcing the climate system, the different external influences that are at play in the
*  climate system.
*  So there was a pronounced slowdown in warming between about 1940 to about 1980.
*  A large contributor of that is what we call aerosols.
*  So pollutants, what sort of normal people think of as pollution, particulate matter
*  that comes off of burning coal plants, burning oil.
*  That was a seriously huge problem in North America and in Western Europe.
*  And that not only showed up in health data and the daily lives of people in those regions,
*  that also showed up in the global average temperature.
*  Because aerosols reflect sunlight, which means that when there are a lot of them out there,
*  less sunlight is cutting to earth and therefore the warming effect is limited.
*  Not just reflecting sunlight.
*  So aerosols are also extremely effective at seeding clouds.
*  So there was that direct effect of aerosols are gas and dust that is blocking the sun,
*  but they are also making clouds which themselves block the sun.
*  And so we have pretty good reason to believe that aerosol emissions were masking the warming.
*  It would have been warmer had those aerosol emissions not been there.
*  Now right now, the world is not emitting zero aerosols, even though after clean air legislation
*  in the US and Western Europe, the aerosol emissions from those regions have substantially
*  fallen.
*  But they've grown elsewhere.
*  So the aerosol burden has declined, but the burden of aerosols has largely shifted.
*  So we're looking at emissions from South and East Asia right now.
*  And we expect in the future that those aerosols are going to be cleaned up.
*  We have already seen air pollution control happening in China in particular, but as populations
*  notice this, they do not necessarily normalize it.
*  They demand changes.
*  They demand action.
*  And so in industrializing countries, the pattern tends to be that air pollution gets really,
*  really, really bad as the countries industrialize.
*  And then people get really, really angry about it and something is done about it.
*  So it is an unalloyed good thing that air pollution is projected to fall in the future.
*  But in terms of the climate impact, we're going to see less of that masking.
*  We're going to see less stuff in the atmosphere that's reflecting the sun.
*  And so that is a really, really important problem in the future that even if we got
*  rid of all fossil fuel infrastructure tomorrow, in the short term, we would see a spike in
*  temperature because of that air pollution, which is killing us, but also blocking the
*  sun.
*  And the size of that spike is there's a lot of uncertainty around it even more than some
*  of the other forcings.
*  My understanding is that the sort of median estimate is that it's offering about a half
*  a degree Celsius of cooling and that some estimates get quite close to a full degree
*  of Celsius of cooling, which we're not going to be cutting that pollution tomorrow
*  instantaneously, but in a sort of an imaginary model world where you did do that, you could
*  be dealing with a quite dramatic spike, not just the equivalent of this July, but something
*  like a much larger and more pronounced effect.
*  And maybe even over the next few decades seeing as much warming from aerosol reduction as
*  from additional carbon emissions.
*  Yeah, I do want to be very clear that that is not a reason not to cut aerosol emissions,
*  but it is something that we have to be aware of.
*  There is a big difference though between aerosols and greenhouse gases in how they get into
*  the atmosphere and what they do once they're there.
*  So all of the greenhouse gases we're talking about are well mixed in the atmosphere.
*  So that means it doesn't matter who emits them.
*  Somebody in America emits them, somebody in China emits them, somebody in Australia, doesn't
*  matter.
*  Every molecule of greenhouse gas put in the atmosphere has the same warming effect, no
*  matter where it comes from.
*  Aerosols are far more localized.
*  Their impact depends on prevailing winds, their impact depends on where they are emitted,
*  and they don't live very long in the atmosphere after they're put there.
*  The way I read a lot of the sort of real-time scientific analysis says that a lot of these
*  anomalies that we've seen this year are within the range of what was possible.
*  So in that sense, as you say, it sort of confirms some of the predictions and models that we've
*  made, but they're also on the high end.
*  And I wonder exactly how you think we should think about that pair of facts, that it's
*  not that these events are showing us that our science is off, but it is showing us that
*  we may be, at least in particular areas on particular points, skiing along the high end
*  of what we thought was possible at this level of warming.
*  There are ways of interpreting that as a comforting set of facts, and there are ways of interpreting
*  it as a discomforting set of facts.
*  So how do you think about it?
*  From my perspective as a physical scientist, which I do not expect to be the same perspective
*  as a normal person, but for me, when there is a discontinuity or a disconnect between
*  what the models say and what is actually happening, my first question is why?
*  Is it just because, well, weird stuff happens sometimes and this just happens to be an event
*  that is unusual?
*  Or is it some fundamental process that we're missing?
*  Is there something we don't understand about the science?
*  And in some cases, we have identified things that we don't understand about the science,
*  and there are a whole bunch of excited scientists trying to work on those problems to try to
*  figure out the thing that we don't know.
*  I think it is unnecessarily fatalistic to say, oh, is the science right or is it wrong?
*  I think for me, the important question is what do we understand and what don't we understand
*  and why?
*  I think that kind of gets us into a broader question about what climate models are supposed
*  to do.
*  A climate model is supposed to be one not in which the world as we know it actually
*  But it's something in which the world we know it is possible.
*  And what I mean by that is a climate model is not designed to capture what we call the
*  internal variability of the climate system, the natural random slash back and forth of
*  air and water that kind of determines day-to-day weather and even seasonal conditions like
*  an El Nino.
*  A climate model is not designed to say in 1998, there was an El Nino and this year there
*  is an El Nino and in three years there's going to be a La Nino.
*  A climate model instead, you can run it over and over and over again and every time you
*  run it, the conditions are going to be slightly different.
*  The slosh of air and water are going to be in a slightly different position.
*  And so a climate model is not a weather model.
*  It's not designed to sort of predict short-term conditions or even medium-term conditions.
*  What they should do is they should reproduce the statistics of these events.
*  They should get the statistics correct.
*  And that brings us into kind of a weird place because when we're talking about the statistics
*  of extreme events, when we call them extreme events, we're kind of acknowledging that these
*  things are historically really rare.
*  It's really hard to get those statistics.
*  And so we are really reliant on the models to kind of tell us like, is this expected
*  or not?
*  How far out of the normal is this?
*  Is there going to be a normal anymore?
*  What is that new normal going to look like?
*  And I think the question of is it worse than we expected, that's often quite oversold,
*  I think, in the discussion.
*  My question to that is, well, did you check?
*  Because a lot of these record-shattering events, no climate model was able to exactly predict
*  in 2021 in the Pacific Northwest, there's going to be a devastating heat wave.
*  But if you look at the emergence of these record-shattering conditions, climate models
*  pretty much say that they should be happening.
*  You shouldn't just expect records to be broken, you should expect them to be shattered.
*  Yeah, I mean, one thing it calls to my mind, and I'm reading this literature a little bit
*  more of a distance than you are, is just striking to me that we're talking about this summer
*  using all these variables which are much more prominent in the discourse than they were
*  a few years ago.
*  We are still figuring things out, we are still learning, and as a result, it makes me feel
*  like as we're entering into this time of real climate transformation, we're also being confronted
*  with this huge amount of uncertainty around everything we know.
*  We have models that they have confidence intervals, but living that confidence interval means
*  actually living under a lot of uncertainty, because are you going to land at the fifth
*  percentile outcome, are you going to land at the 95th percentile outcome?
*  Those are huge differences.
*  Mentally, we sort of calibrate our expectations on the median projections, but the world is
*  telling us that climate and climate change is actually quite a bit messier than taking
*  a median projection to the bank.
*  Absolutely.
*  For a long time, I personally have been really reluctant to talk about uncertainty, because
*  it is so easily weaponized by bad faith actors.
*  So I want to be really clear, we don't know everything, but we don't know nothing.
*  There are certain things that we are very, very, very confident in.
*  Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, these are greenhouse gases.
*  They make the earth warmer.
*  You put more of them in the atmosphere, you are going to see warming.
*  That's not something that really any serious scientist disputes.
*  That's just very, very basic physics.
*  Then when it comes to, well, what does that actually mean?
*  What does it mean to live in a world that's getting warmer?
*  Again, there are some things that we are incredibly confident in, because they're just basic physics.
*  Warmer air is thirstier air.
*  You are getting more evaporation from the surface of the earth.
*  That water has to go somewhere.
*  And so on average, precipitation rates increase as well.
*  At the same time, we know that warm air can hold more water vapor.
*  So the carrying capacity of air for water vapor increases by about 7% for every degree
*  Celsius we warm.
*  And what that means is that when we do have these heavy downpours, there is more water
*  to dump on us.
*  That's something that we understand really, really well.
*  But then what does that mean for rainfall in a particular town, a particular area?
*  That's where we start really running into the limitations of our knowledge, the limitations
*  of models in general.
*  And that's because the earth is an incredibly complex interconnected system.
*  And that complexity can make it really, really difficult to make solid, firm projections.
*  A lot of times, uncertainty is seized upon because people think, oh, it's uncertain.
*  Well, it could be terrible, but it could also be great.
*  And so it'll probably be fine.
*  And I think it's really important to be clear that we have ruled out fine.
*  It's not going to be fine.
*  Warming is going to have consequences.
*  And uncertainty is not our friend.
*  Because if we had that degree of certainty, if we knew sea levels will rise exactly this
*  amount and then they will stop, and warming will stabilize at exactly this amount and
*  it will stop, we would be able to make rational adaptation decisions.
*  They would be difficult, they would be costly, but we would be able to make those decisions.
*  Because there is that fundamental uncertainty in the system that's impeding our ability
*  to make decisions and to adapt to what's coming and what's already here.
*  One thing I think about is science always has uncertainty built into it.
*  But it's also just this crazy uncertainty experiment that we're running by moving the
*  planet's climate into a new climate system in which there are going to be a lot of similarities
*  and continuities, but there are going to be some things that are really different.
*  And so there's beyond the sort of basic scientific humility of acknowledging uncertainty, there's
*  also just, you know, we're running this experiment for the first time and we have very good educated
*  guesses about where it will lead us.
*  But it's the risk of running an experiment like this at all is that there are going to
*  be some things that surprise us.
*  When you and I last spoke, it was about a year ago, and it was for a piece I was doing
*  about kind of the narrowing window of climate future.
*  So a lot of apocalyptic things, a lot of apocalyptic future seems, you know, relatively speaking,
*  less likely, although we can rule them out entirely.
*  And as you just said a minute ago, a lot of the everything's going to be fine, soft landing
*  futures were also looking pretty unlikely, if not impossible.
*  One of the other people I spoke to for that piece was Catherine Hayhoe, and she said something
*  to me that I've been thinking about a lot this summer, which was, you know, we've definitely
*  done a lot in decarbonization to reduce the upper limit of our expected warming.
*  We're thinking we're going to see less warming than we thought was likely five years ago.
*  That's great.
*  We're also learning a lot about when climate extremes arise, when really big impacts might
*  hit us hard.
*  And mostly we're learning that those are happening sooner and faster than we might have thought
*  five or ten years ago.
*  And you see a sort of similar story unfolding in the tipping points discourse, where the
*  people who have been most worried about tipping points used to talk about them as risks at
*  higher levels of warming, and are now talking about them as risks at lower levels of warming,
*  maybe even at levels of warming like the one we're at right now.
*  And I wonder if that is how you see the really big picture here, that even as we're doing
*  quite a lot to take control of global average temperature rise through decarbonization,
*  not enough but a lot, we're also learning about how messy and risky life at even lower
*  temperatures would be.
*  I agree.
*  I think a lot of times people are tempted to see a Paris agreement warming target, like
*  2 degrees Celsius or 1.5 degrees, which is the high ambition warming target, which a
*  lot of people are really focused on right now.
*  Those targets are not very meaningful scientifically.
*  The earth doesn't really know the difference between 1.5 and 1.6.
*  So a lot of times people think, well, tipping points will definitely be triggered if we
*  cross a particular threshold.
*  And that goes back to the question of uncertainty.
*  I don't have enough certainty.
*  I don't have enough science.
*  Nobody does to be able to say we are safe if we limit warming to a particular level.
*  The flip side is also true.
*  We are not doomed if we exceed 1.5.
*  We are not doomed if we exceed 2.
*  If we blow past a particular target, I think the UN messaging is correct, that it's every
*  tenth of a degree that matters.
*  But going back to your question of when might we expect these tipping points to be breached,
*  that's something that keeps a lot of scientists up at night.
*  So the scientific definition of a tipping point is something that you cross that you
*  can't get back within timescales relevant to human lives or human civilizations.
*  So some of the tipping points that we're really worried about have to do with the circulation
*  of the atmosphere or the ocean.
*  That's something that is very, very worrisome.
*  Well, talk us through a little bit maybe about each of those and what it would look like
*  to cross those thresholds and be on the other side of a tipping point.
*  Sure.
*  So let's talk a little bit about what the ocean actually does for us.
*  The ocean is incredibly important in the climate system.
*  It's obviously a near infinite source of water.
*  That's where water gets evaporated from, that then gets turned into clouds and rain and
*  goes back.
*  It also is really, really effective at taking up both carbon and heat.
*  So the ocean's taking up about 25% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions.
*  That's not for free.
*  A lot of that is going into acidifying the ocean.
*  The ocean's also very effective at taking up heat.
*  It's absorbing the equivalent of five nuclear bombs a second of anthropogenically added
*  heat, heat that humans have put in the atmosphere.
*  And another way of just thinking about that first, just to jump in for a second, is it's
*  something like 90% of the extra heat that global warming has produced goes into the
*  ocean, which means they're getting nine times as much of an impact as we're getting on
*  land to the oceans.
*  Yeah.
*  The ocean does a lot.
*  The ocean also moves quite a lot of heat around in the climate system.
*  The currents that have names, the currents that we think about are generally surface
*  currents, things like the Gulf Stream.
*  Those are driven by the winds and the rotation of the earth.
*  The Gulf Stream and other surface currents will exist no matter what we do.
*  They will exist as long as the earth is round and rotating.
*  But those surface current systems are superposed on a deeper, longer term circulation, which
*  we call the thermohaline circulation.
*  And that is really driven by not wind, but density.
*  So what happens when water flows north to the Arctic, for example, in the Atlantic?
*  Eventually, a lot of it forms sea ice.
*  The left behind water that doesn't form the sea ice is saltier.
*  It's cold, it's dense, and that makes it sink.
*  So at the bottom of the ocean, we have this sort of river of failed ice that is flowing,
*  and it's flowing southward.
*  Eventually, that water up wells, it comes to the surface again, and it closes that loop.
*  So we have this density-driven ocean conveyor belt that moves over hundreds or thousands
*  of years water around the earth's oceans.
*  And when the circulation of that gets messed up, we could expect to see large disruptions
*  to things like precipitation patterns.
*  We have really good evidence that in the 70s and 80s, pollution, particulate matter, what
*  we call aerosols from Western Europe and North America actually cooled the North Atlantic.
*  And there is a lot of evidence that links that to a migration of the rain band, especially
*  over the Sahel and Africa.
*  So that is just kind of an example of how, again, interconnected everything is.
*  Other things scientists are thinking about are disruptions to the arrivals of the seasonal
*  monsoons, much like the rainfall in the Sahel that I discussed.
*  The monsoons are very seasonal, and enormous swaths of the world population is dependent
*  on monsoon rain-fed agriculture.
*  So any disruption we have to the monsoon could have massive, massive humanitarian consequences.
*  And that's only the circulation category of tipping points we might see.
*  And those are systems that if they move into a new phase, we would expect to not recover
*  on the time scale of centuries, right?
*  It would take longer than that.
*  So then how does that change the way that you think about the broader story?
*  One thing, as I've been reckoning with a lot of this material that's occurred to me, is
*  that we have so much science and so much science communication about climate change impacts
*  this century.
*  But thinking about tipping points really does sort of pull your mind a little bit further
*  into the future and force you to think about climate change as a millennial kind of event.
*  How do you balance those two perspectives in your mind?
*  Because there are plenty of things that may result in relatively manageable climate futures
*  over the course of the next 50 years, but over the course of the next five centuries
*  or 10 centuries will be much more disruptive.
*  Sea level rise is probably the most obvious of those.
*  But how do you balance those two different time scale perspectives?
*  So living in the present where we're making decisions, living a little bit in the medium-term
*  future where we think about the sort of consequences of those decisions for our children and their
*  grandchildren and then in the much deeper future where we're like thinking about a world
*  that's probably in ways totally independent of climate, very transformed from the one
*  that we know today.
*  You can ask a question, what is the warming commitment that we've already locked in, even
*  if we zeroed out emissions tomorrow?
*  If we zeroed out emissions tomorrow, the consensus among most of the models is that
*  warming would stop.
*  You would have a balance between two effects.
*  So the ocean would continue to warm up, but at the same time, the natural carbon cycle
*  would start to slowly remove some of that carbon that's accumulated in the atmosphere.
*  And the net effect of those is essentially no more warming.
*  And this is one of the reasons why getting to net zero is so important.
*  It's not just because it actually allows us to stop warming.
*  Over the course of a century or so, it would allow us to undo some of it too, in theory.
*  Net negative would probably undo it because again, at net zero, you've got this natural
*  drawdown of some of the CO2 in the atmosphere, but at the same time, you've got the ocean
*  still responding.
*  And so the compensation of those is not that warming decreases, but warming stops.
*  In order to get warming to decrease, you generally need to do something extra to take
*  CO2 out of the air, whether those are enhancing land or ocean natural sinks or engineering
*  a sink, so sucking CO2 out of the air somehow.
*  But then the question is, okay, well, if warming stops whenever we stop emitting, does that
*  mean climate change stops?
*  And the answer is no, because we are still not finished responding to the warming that
*  has already occurred.
*  So even if we did zero out emissions tomorrow, and even if we froze the temperature at 1.2
*  degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, the Earth system is not done responding to
*  that.
*  And so we expect to see some amount of sea level rise into the far, far future as a result
*  of that.
*  So that's kind of one way of answering your question.
*  We are not committed to further warming.
*  We can stop any time we want to, but we are not yet done responding to the warming that's
*  occurred already.
*  I've seen estimates for the amount of additional warming that would be required to keep carbon
*  concentrations stable, which is to say to prevent the carbon cycle to draw down that
*  carbon and keep warming going as opposed to even stopping it at something like one to
*  two gigatons a year.
*  And maybe that's not precisely right.
*  There's uncertainty around that.
*  But it just is really striking to me that the Canadian wildfires we've seen this year
*  have already emitted more than a gigaton of carbon.
*  And we're not expecting those to happen every single year.
*  But the idea that we can be sure that if we manage our emissions as aggressively as we
*  can, that there aren't going to be some surprises like those Canadian fires that are contributing
*  additional carbon and preventing us from drawing down what's in the atmosphere already, that
*  seems quite scary.
*  That brings up another potentially scary thing, which is the idea of a carbon cycle
*  feedback.
*  So as you pointed out, things that live on the surface of the planet, either in the ocean
*  or on the land, take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by photosynthesis to make themselves
*  grow.
*  You know, a forest takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, not because it loves us,
*  not because it wants to absolve humans of what we do, but because it needs the carbon
*  dioxide to grow.
*  Trees exist to exist.
*  And when they are done existing, they are done sequestering that carbon dioxide.
*  And if we bank on trees to take the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere for us, what
*  happens when we make it too hot for certain types of trees to survive?
*  There's a lot of worry, speaking of tipping points, that the Amazon rainforest and other
*  tropical rainforests could switch from being a net sink of carbon dioxide, removing it
*  from the air, to a net source of carbon dioxide.
*  And so these carbon cycle feedbacks, how are living things on the planet going to respond
*  to increased warming?
*  Those are big wild cards.
*  The uncertainties are large.
*  It's almost never a good story.
*  None of the models are projecting a significant uptick in the ability of the biosphere to
*  remove carbon in the future.
*  So that kind of gets back to, should we do that experiment?
*  And I think no.
*  I don't want to know what the carbon cycle feedbacks are.
*  I don't want to know how sensitive the earth is to doubled carbon dioxide.
*  I don't want to know the answer to any of these research questions that I'm interested
*  in.
*  I don't think we should do that experiment.
*  One of the things that has always struck me about your writing and your thinking, not
*  just your scientific work, but in your sort of more essayistic work, is how much you do
*  center the sort of the human elements.
*  There's these climate dynamics that are going on.
*  Some of them we understand quite well, others a little bit less well, but we have a pretty
*  good sense of the broad trajectory of climate change.
*  We may even have a relatively good sense of where the energy transition is going.
*  But all of that is like interacting and interfacing with the world that we have built socially,
*  politically, economically, through culture, through infrastructure.
*  And in addition to the climate experiment we're running, we're also running this other
*  quite messy experiment, which is like, how does a planet warmed by say two degrees or
*  two and a half degrees interact with the civilization that we built under conditions
*  of zero degrees of warming?
*  And even putting aside like whether the infrastructure works or doesn't, how does it interact with
*  our politics and our economics to be responding to and adjusting to a world that's as distorted
*  or contorted as a world of two or two and a half degrees would be?
*  I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that, about the human element, how you think
*  we're doing on that front.
*  Politically, culturally, psychologically, are we making the right sense of the changes
*  that we're seeing out in the world?
*  Are we confused about it?
*  Are there things that you think the public should better understand or you wish the public
*  would better understand about what is being asked of us as people in addition to what
*  we're doing to the planet itself?
*  I think I am probably the worst person in the world to ask that question of because
*  I am a physicist, right?
*  It is my job to understand how air and water move around in the system.
*  And air does exactly what physics tells it to do.
*  It's really easy to understand.
*  It always does the same thing.
*  It fits inside an equation really well.
*  There are uncertainties that come from the fact that there's a lot of air, there's a
*  lot of water, there's a lot of land.
*  It's all interacting.
*  But fundamentally, those things do what you tell them to do because they are obeying the
*  laws of physics.
*  People do not do what you tell them to do.
*  That's why I find them fascinating, but that's also why I don't understand them and I don't
*  make any pretense to having any sort of special insight or moral superiority to tell people
*  what to do.
*  I do find people very interesting though, and I do find past examples of how people
*  have reacted to past climate change to be completely fascinating.
*  So in between the 1300s, 1400s to about the 1700s, in the Northern Hemisphere, we seem
*  to have experienced relatively cool conditions, something that's sometimes called the Little
*  Ice Age.
*  The best attribution science now sort of thinks that was due to a mixture of some circulation
*  changes in the North Atlantic and primarily a series of really powerful volcanic explosions,
*  which blocked the sun, cooled down the planet, at least partially.
*  And if you look at the history, especially in Europe of the Little Ice Age, things start
*  getting real weird.
*  You start seeing an increase in religious conflict.
*  You also start seeing an increase in witch burnings.
*  And a lot of times the witches that are getting burned are getting burned or hung or executed
*  or accused because of something they have done to the weather.
*  They have raised a storm.
*  They have killed the crops.
*  They have made the winds blow.
*  They have done something.
*  And it's really fascinating to look at the linkages between the weather getting weird
*  and these cultural impacts that come out of it.
*  Now do I think that climate change is going to lead to an increase in witch burning?
*  No.
*  But it does show how climate change happens in the world that we've built for it.
*  And that's something that is impossible to fit in an equation.
*  It's impossible to have a model that's at all meaningful that says that, well, as carbon
*  dioxide concentrations increase, the number of old women who are going to be accused of
*  witchcraft is also going to increase.
*  That's not something that makes any sense.
*  But that really does show the fundamental unpredictability of human beings and human
*  civilizations in the face of adversity.
*  Sometimes there is conflict.
*  People fight each other.
*  Sometimes there is collaboration.
*  Which one of those is more likely to happen?
*  Well, I think both are going to happen in the future.
*  And I think it's really impossible to have a grand unified theory of a species that's
*  so deeply weird as we are.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to talk a little bit in a minute about the suitability of the world as we have built
*  it for the climate that we are entering into.
*  But before we get to that, I just wanted to pick up on a couple threads from that last
*  answer.
*  I was just reading an article in The Economist about the heat waves and in it they drew on
*  this work by Marshall Burke and Sol Sheng and Edward Miguel about the relationship between
*  climate and conflict, which suggested that as global average temperatures got hotter,
*  we might see some significant additional conflict, mostly at the interstate and civil war level.
*  And The Economist was saying just looking at the anomalous temperatures in July, we might
*  see like 50% more conflict than we would see otherwise without that warming.
*  And I emailed Marshall and said, well, I know your data was based on long term average trends.
*  Is this a fair leap to make?
*  And he said, well, we're actually updating it for monthly averages and the numbers aren't
*  very different.
*  So I wouldn't be surprised if that was actually how it netted out.
*  And that is absolutely astonishing to think about even in the range of possibilities here.
*  But it also brings to mind all of these other questions about how we talk about the attribution
*  of really complicated events and episodes to climate change or not.
*  How do you think about how to talk about that complicated web of causality?
*  And how do you think the world as a whole is doing in understanding just how complicated
*  those dynamics really are?
*  I think we need to acknowledge that we're not going to get the comfort of this false
*  binary.
*  We're not going to be able to say climate was the only factor.
*  But that doesn't mean it's not a factor.
*  Take for example, wildfires.
*  Wildfires are dependent on many different things.
*  They're dependent on the weather, hot, dry conditions.
*  They're dependent on the amount of fuel.
*  They're dependent on ignition, so either lightning or human action.
*  And they're dependent on suppression.
*  The damage they do really depends who's living in harm's way.
*  And not all of those things are amenable to description by physics.
*  I focus a lot on the physical causes because that's my job.
*  That's my expertise.
*  But when we talk about wildfires, let's take for example, even though we're here on the
*  East Coast, we've had impacts from Eastern Canadian wildfires.
*  Let's talk about wildfires in the West because the science is much more robust when we talk
*  about wildfires in Western North America.
*  We do know that the hot, dry conditions that are more conducive to fire, fire weather,
*  those are getting much more likely.
*  We also have reason to believe that we're going to see much, I guess, swingier precipitation.
*  Really, really wet, wet seasons, really, really hot and dry, dry seasons.
*  That has implications for fuel, right?
*  If you have a really, really wet winter, you could have a lot of vegetation growing and
*  that vegetation is going to dry out in the summer and burn.
*  So those things are kind of amenable to description via equations.
*  We can say, this is our knowledge of physics.
*  This is how it's changing.
*  But what does that mean in terms of the ability or the desire of humans to venture into forests
*  and build campfires or have gender reveal parties or whatever?
*  You are looking at the culmination of not just current policy choices, but a long history
*  of policy choices.
*  Who gets to live on that land?
*  Who gets driven off that land?
*  Who gets to make these decisions?
*  And again, I can't put it in a climate model, but it doesn't mean that it's not vitally,
*  crucially important.
*  Yeah, I mean, wildfire, I think, is a really powerful example for a number of reasons.
*  But one of the things that I always find myself thinking about is hearing occasionally from
*  people who say, we shouldn't worry all that much about the trends in wildfire because
*  fires used to be much more pervasive in the American West 500 years ago, 200 years ago.
*  And that's true.
*  There was more burning in those forests in the past.
*  But also there were not 40 million people living in California.
*  There were probably less than one million.
*  And the way that we think about those risks has a huge amount to do with those 40 million
*  people, not just the fires themselves and whether 2020 was merely the worst season in
*  130 years or whether it was the worst season in 500 years.
*  And even in a relatively steady climate trajectory where things are getting kind of predictably
*  worse, our experience of that climate may still involve quite a lot of shock moments
*  because the world that we've built out in the infrastructural world, but also our political
*  systems, our emotional infrastructure, all of that is calibrated to climate conditions
*  we've already left behind.
*  And as a result, there's going to be some episodes in which we can tolerate some amount
*  of additional warming and some higher impacts and risks.
*  But then at a certain point, that gets broken.
*  If you think about sea level rise and floods and a small flood wall can protect some high
*  days of flooding, then you get a really, you know, even just the last foot can have a completely
*  devastating impact on the city.
*  I wonder how you think about that set of questions, like the degree to which we are, all of us
*  living on assumptions from an earlier climate era, how much we have to do to navigate the
*  new world full of more climate risks.
*  And how far along in that process we are at a policy level, but also at a, you know, emotional
*  sort of intellectual level.
*  So first of all, no adaptation is not really an option anymore.
*  We have no choice but to adapt to the changing climate because climate change is already
*  here.
*  I was watching a documentary the other day and it was kind of old, it was about 15 years
*  old and I was so struck by the fact that they were using polar bears to illustrate climate
*  change.
*  And I was thinking, nobody really does that anymore because it's so obvious that this
*  is not a problem that just affects polar bears.
*  This is a problem that is affecting us and it's something that we are going to have to
*  prepare for.
*  At the same time, you sometimes hear this very glib like, oh, we're rich, we'll just
*  adapt, especially in wealthy countries.
*  And there is no just to the adaptation because first of all, if you don't reach net zero,
*  stop climate change, it's a constant moving target.
*  Adapt to what?
*  On the other hand, adaptation means something really, really drastic.
*  It means relocation of communities.
*  It means maybe abandoning really beloved areas.
*  It is an extraordinary undertaking.
*  That doesn't mean that it's not necessary.
*  That doesn't mean that it's not possible.
*  But I don't think we should be glib about it at all.
*  Along the way there, there's also the risk, I think, that as we see more and more intense
*  impacts start to adapt to some degree, we also adapt by normalizing and by acclimatizing
*  to things that we would have considered unworkable and unlivable conditions not that long ago.
*  I think our experience with wildfire smoke here is pretty illuminating, which is to say
*  there were people who worried about smoke impacts from fires five years ago in California,
*  but most people worried about property damage and lives lost and towns being destroyed.
*  Then starting in 2020 when we had these really eerie images from San Francisco, really bad
*  toxic air days, I think the public started to worry a bit more about smoke and public
*  health impacts.
*  But those of us living in the East Coast were like, well, that's crazy Californians.
*  They're dealing with that.
*  That's well beyond what I could tolerate in my own life.
*  And then we had a few days, depending on how you want to count, a few days or a few weeks
*  of really bad air here.
*  And almost like by the second or third day, the emotional calibration, at least of people
*  I knew was like, well, I guess this is going to be a thing now.
*  It wasn't to treat this impact, which five years ago we would have thought of as totally
*  intolerable as still intolerable.
*  It was to incorporate that into our understanding of the next 10 or 15 years of our lives.
*  And there's a way in which that's quite healthy because probably it is going to be a feature
*  of at least our worries, if not coming every summer.
*  But it also tells us something about how quickly we're redefining our standards for a comfortable
*  climate capable of sustaining human flourishing and how differently we're defining those terms
*  in order to allow ourselves some safe operating space emotionally for living in that world.
*  I'm actually going to disagree with you because what is a podcast without a good fight?
*  I actually think we cannot normalize this and we have to push back really, really hard.
*  When you say cannot, you mean that it's beyond our capacity or do you mean that we have to
*  resist it?
*  We have to resist it.
*  And I think there has been a strain in climate storytelling of fatalism.
*  And sometimes that fatalism is coupled with, well, humans are bad and terrible and this
*  is our divine judgment, our punishment.
*  Sometimes it's scolding, like you are terrible and this is your punishment and I have to
*  live with it and I hate you.
*  And sometimes it's just very sort of fatalistic.
*  There's nothing we can do about climate change.
*  We're just going to have to live like this for the rest of our lives.
*  When the Cuyahoga River caught on fire, the air quality was terrible in New York, but
*  that would have been kind of a moderately bad day, not that much different than normal,
*  you know, in my parents' lifetime.
*  And that was normalized for a long time until it wasn't, until it became clear that there
*  were solutions.
*  Now I don't want to say that any particular single piece of legislation can ever solve
*  all of the problems, but the Clean Air Act of 1970, which was not passed by a wonderful,
*  loving man who loved humanity and the environment.
*  That's not how you describe Richard Nixon?
*  No, it is not.
*  You know, there was a confluence of factors.
*  There was increased scientific understanding of where this problem was coming from and
*  what we could do about it.
*  There was popular pressure.
*  The first Earth Day was 1970.
*  Lots of people out on the streets marching, school groups, church groups.
*  And there was a president who saw an opening, not because he was a lovely, warm, fuzzy,
*  wonderful person, but because the conditions made this possible.
*  And I think there are a lot of stories of environmental success in the record.
*  None of them are perfect analogies for where we are.
*  That's what it means to be living in the future.
*  We are not living in a story that has ever happened before.
*  I'm sorry, that's just what it means to be alive.
*  But I think we cannot normalize this.
*  We cannot say the climate is just going to change and we're going to blow past all of
*  these targets and it's just going to get worse and worse and worse.
*  Like I think we have to demand this is bullshit.
*  We don't like this.
*  We don't want to live like this instead of accepting it.
*  Well, I think as a sort of political goal and value set, that's totally admirable.
*  But when I think about, for instance, the way that people in Florida or California are
*  responding to the end of insurance for their homes, we're not seeing a mass exodus.
*  In fact, we're still seeing to some degree in some parts of the state's real population
*  growth.
*  We're seeing tons of people flooding to the parts of the US where climate impacts are
*  expected to be most intense.
*  Maybe that's a sign of optimism about our ability to redesign our future to allow us
*  to live in those conditions.
*  But it also seems like not necessarily the most rational response to a climate we know
*  is changing and suggests that on the whole, at a population level, even as we're endeavoring
*  to limit warming and endeavoring to make a future that's more livable, we're also coming
*  to accept climate outcomes that a decade or a generation ago would have seemed quite horrifying
*  to many of us.
*  I mean, I think we have no choice, but you say accept, I say continue to live through.
*  I don't know precisely what the boundary between acceptance and merely continuing to exist
*  is.
*  Yes, these are conditions that are happening.
*  The skies in New York were orange earlier this summer.
*  In Phoenix, it's been over 100 degrees for however long.
*  These are conditions that are happening.
*  I think that it is completely appropriate to demand that they not happen.
*  We can't demand no global warming.
*  We're already at 1.1, 1.2 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures.
*  We can't put that cap back in the back.
*  We can't say we want no global warming, but we can say we want to limit global warming
*  and we want sensible adaptation measures.
*  And both of those things are incredibly tall orders.
*  That's what politics is for, right?
*  We want to live in a society.
*  We want there to be buildings built.
*  We want there to be roads.
*  We want there to be subways.
*  And all of those things are way, way bigger than any one person can deliver.
*  But we want them, so we have them.
*  And I think we need to say this is not acceptable.
*  This is not normal.
*  And things have to change.
*  And when you take off your physicist hat and put on your politics hat, how do you assess
*  the state of climate politics in the US and more generally around the world?
*  I mean, obviously, we're moving faster than used to be the case.
*  There's more general consensus about the fact of the problem, the necessity of taking some
*  action in response to it than even just five years ago across the world.
*  But we're still falling short of the goals and targets that we sort of collectively set
*  for ourselves, even as some of those targets start to seem less safe than they might have
*  seemed five or 10 years ago.
*  So how do you think about the state of politics as it relates to this challenge?
*  Like, how do you calibrate your own sense of where we are and where we're headed?
*  I have scrupulously avoided having a politics hat.
*  I don't want one.
*  What I can say from my personal experience is I have noticed a sea change.
*  Five, 10, 15 years ago, there was only one story that ever got told about climate change.
*  And it was, is it happening?
*  Let's get all of these scientists who say it is and like this one guy says it's not.
*  All right, let's have them fight.
*  And I understand where that came from.
*  The urge to sort of inject conflict and drama into what's fundamentally a really, really
*  difficult thing to wrap your mind around.
*  Sometimes it would be scientists fighting with guy in a suit.
*  Sometimes it would be like, look at this sad polar bear.
*  It's going to die and it's all your fault because you're a bad person.
*  But those were really the only stories that ever got told.
*  And in, I want to say 2018, because that was the release of the UN's 1.5 degree special
*  report, which mea culpa, I was grouchy about.
*  I thought it was fan fiction.
*  I thought, well, there's no way we're going to limit warming to 1.5 degrees.
*  Why are you doing this?
*  And, you know, like, oh boy, what the world needs is another report.
*  Great.
*  Let's do that again.
*  And for reasons that I don't understand, I was so wrong.
*  I was so wrong about how that was going to be received.
*  I was so wrong about how that would land.
*  And it started something.
*  Now, the same year that Greta started striking the foundation of XR, the sit in of
*  sunrise.
*  Talk about tipping points.
*  That's not something that I was able to anticipate.
*  And now I almost never get asked, is it real?
*  I almost never get asked, well, what does climate change mean?
*  And why should I care?
*  Instead, I get asked the really good questions about uncertainty, about what's
*  happening, about how we can prepare, about what we can do.
*  And for me personally, the fact that we are talking about what we can do is really
*  exciting because all I ever wanted to be in the climate debate and climate politics
*  was irrelevant.
*  And I am really, really rapidly as a scientist approaching that point where I am
*  not the first point of contact.
*  If you're writing a climate story, you don't necessarily go and talk to a scientist
*  and say, oh, hey, is this real?
*  Is this really happening?
*  You're going to go and you're going to talk to somebody who works in renewable
*  energy.
*  You're going to talk to an electrician.
*  You're going to talk to somebody trying to craft climate policy.
*  You're going to talk to an entrepreneur.
*  And now there are so many more stories to be told about climate.
*  And that's something that is a massive, massive sea change for me.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think you're being too modest about being irrelevant, even speaking on
*  behalf of climate science, because I do think that there are these really important
*  questions about exactly what it means.
*  The difference between two and two and a half degree is particular impacts in
*  local plant.
*  Like there's a huge amount for science to tell us.
*  I do think we're living in a different world now where we do see the machinery of
*  decarbonization actually finally getting going.
*  We're starting to see that show up in our understanding of, and our projections for
*  the future.
*  All of that's extremely exciting, but I worry a little bit that the story of
*  progress and decarbonization is crowding out some of these other challenges and
*  these other difficulties that we are excited to be on the march to net zero, even
*  if it's going to be in 2070 as opposed to 2050.
*  And we're excited to be, you know, making impossible the scariest climate futures
*  that some of us worried a lot about a few years ago, but that doesn't mean that
*  the challenges aren't real and real right in front of us and may even prove quite
*  catastrophic when all is said and done.
*  And I wonder how you think about those questions at a sort of storytelling level,
*  which is we obviously need to be talking about both of these things at once.
*  The things that the climate is telling us about how different and likely how much
*  harder life will be because of climate changes, but also everything we're doing
*  to take control of those challenges, both through limiting warming and through
*  adapting. But finding that balance feels to me like pretty hard.
*  And maybe it feels hard to me because I'm just on a roller coaster about it.
*  And one month I feel one way and one month I feel the next way about it.
*  How do you think about it?
*  Yeah, again, as a kind of a storytelling level.
*  I think all I can do is answer for myself.
*  So I don't feel one particular way about climate change.
*  I feel many different ways about climate change.
*  Some days I'm very excited.
*  I'm very kind of joyful by looking at all of the work that's being done.
*  Sometimes I'm really afraid.
*  Sometimes I'm really, really angry.
*  And I think that's completely appropriate and normal and natural to hold all of
*  these things in my head.
*  Going back to your question before about the time scales, I want to kind of invert
*  that question because that's the way that I think about this a lot.
*  So there's a really negative story you could tell where even if we get everything
*  right, even if we reach net zero in 2050, like we're supposed to, and all of these
*  amazing technologies come online and we rebuild our entire energy system, our
*  transportation system, we really transform our farm system, we do everything right.
*  We're not really going to be able to tell climate wise for decades.
*  The best case scenario from a climate perspective is just less bad than it would
*  be otherwise.
*  And that's because it takes a really, really long time for these changes to kind of
*  percolate through the system for you to distinguish the signal from the noise.
*  So it's going to take decades to say, oh, we're in the good place as opposed to the
*  bad place or not the good place, the less bad place.
*  But if you look at the near term benefits, you get rid of a coal fired power plant
*  and immediately the next time it rains, that washes out all of the gross particulate
*  matter pollution that coal plant put in the atmosphere.
*  So you get cleaner air almost immediately.
*  That starts to show up in mortality morbidity statistics really, really, really
*  quickly.
*  And just to put a pin on it for the listeners, like those numbers are horrifyingly
*  large.
*  You know, some estimates in the millions annually dying from the pollution from
*  fossil fuel burning.
*  The estimates that I've seen say air pollution is a factor in 11 percent of deaths
*  worldwide.
*  We're talking millions and millions and millions of preventable deaths.
*  So air pollution is a killer.
*  Air pollution is disgusting.
*  And air pollution is not something that we have to live with.
*  You know, if I wanted to use the lingo, I'd say that is a co-benefit of climate
*  solutions.
*  But that is a massive near term benefit.
*  And there is a large research literature that says that we're going to see less
*  infant mortality.
*  We're going to see if we do this, we're going to see less mortality morbidity.
*  We're going to see people living longer, healthier lives.
*  We're also going to see increases in things like labor productivity.
*  Now, if we adopt various other climate solutions, we get co-benefits in terms of
*  better biodiversity.
*  Not cutting down forests is a climate solution.
*  And that's going to have co-benefits that show up much, much, much quicker than any
*  climate benefit.
*  And so if you invert that, and I think about this a lot.
*  So in the IPCC report, there is a figure of a child born in various years and the
*  climate that they will experience as they grow older.
*  I want to take that figure and I want to kind of invert it and think about if we
*  take these climate actions, what are the positive benefits that can accrue and when
*  do they start accruing?
*  So if we limit warming to 1.5 C, our great grandchildren are going to thank us for
*  avoiding more catastrophic sea level rise.
*  But if we do that, we ourselves, not our children, not even ourselves in 10 years,
*  we are going to experience those benefits of cleaner air immediately.
*  There's going to be more people alive now.
*  And I think that's something that's really worth doing personally.
*  I think that's a really great place to end.
*  And, you know, since you're a repeat guest, you would know that as you come on
*  the show, you're supposed to come with three book recommendations for the
*  audience. What are your books?
*  My first book recommendation is actually not a book.
*  It is a short story.
*  In fact, it's such a short story that's about a paragraph long.
*  And it's called On Exactitude in Science by Jorge Luis Borges.
*  And it is the perfect distillation of the process of modeling, of trying to
*  represent nature by something smaller and more tractable.
*  My second book recommendation is kind of off the wall one.
*  We talked about the Little Ice Age and we talked about witch burning in the
*  Little Ice Age.
*  Turns out that British monarch, James I, published a paper on how to identify
*  and deal with witches because he was really obsessed with witches being the
*  king in the middle of the Little Ice Age.
*  And he was previously the king of Scotland.
*  He was brought down when Elizabeth I died.
*  And so if you are a playwright and you want to appeal to this kind of Scottish
*  weirdo who's in charge, who's really obsessed with witches, what are you going
*  to write?
*  And so that's where Macbeth comes from.
*  And I have been rereading that in preparation for some things that I'm
*  writing about the Little Ice Age.
*  And I'm just really struck by these themes of guilt and also really struck by
*  the extent to which the witches in Macbeth are manipulating the weather.
*  And so I think that is a really interesting view into a world in a different
*  climate than the one we are in right now.
*  And my third book is not out yet, but it's available for pre-order.
*  And sort of to preface this, I have a lot of problems with climate fiction.
*  I find a lot of it to be kind of unnecessarily apocalyptic or very preachy.
*  And it's just not something that I like to consume off hours.
*  And so there is a book which I've been fortunate enough to read a preliminary
*  draft of.
*  It's called Troubled Waters.
*  It's a novel by Mary Anais Hegler.
*  And it's just a warm and beautiful and complex story about a Southern black
*  family wrestling with the climate crisis.
