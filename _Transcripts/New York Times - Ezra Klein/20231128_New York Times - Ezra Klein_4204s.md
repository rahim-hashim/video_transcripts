# Best Of: This Is Your Brain on Deep Reading. Itâ€™s Pretty Magnificent.
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_NFSDaMj-A)
*  Hey, it is Ezra.
*  We're taking a couple days off for Thanksgiving, but we have here one of my absolute favorite
*  episodes of the show recorded in November 2022 about how reading changes the brain,
*  about how the ways in which we absorb information shifts how we understand it, what we can do
*  with it, and how we think going forward.
*  This was recorded a bit ago.
*  I think it is only more relevant now.
*  We'll be back with a new episode on Friday.
*  I'm Ezra Klein.
*  This is The Ezra Klein Show.
*  Here is the thesis of this conversation put simply.
*  How we read is as deserving of attention as what we read, maybe even more so.
*  And how we read, it has changed dramatically in just a few short years.
*  And that means our minds, the way we think and interpret and reflect on the world, they've
*  changed too, and at stunning speed.
*  Literacy is an experiment humankind ran on itself, that we ran on ourselves pretty recently
*  actually, and it has had remarkable, wondrous results.
*  It has changed us and it has changed our societies.
*  In recent decades, the shift to thinking and reading amidst a cacophony of digital information
*  and dialogue and text, that is another experiment we're running on ourselves.
*  And it is also a seismic one, and it is ongoing and it is early, and we don't know how it
*  will turn out.
*  We don't.
*  But people are trying to figure that out.
*  Marion Wolf is a professor at UCLA School of Education and Information Studies, and
*  she's one of the world's leading experts on how reading works in, and even more importantly,
*  how it works on the brain, how it changes the brain.
*  She's the author of Proust and the Squid, the story and science of the reading brain,
*  and of Reader Come Home, the reading brain in a digital world, among other books.
*  And don't worry, she's not someone who thinks we can or should turn back the clock to try
*  to return to some kind of pre-digital reading utopia.
*  That's not possible, nor was it a utopia.
*  And I'm not that person either.
*  My whole career, my whole life is built on digital text.
*  Her idea is something different, that we need to understand what different kinds of reading
*  do to our minds.
*  And then we need to develop in ourselves and our children what she calls a biliterate brain.
*  And as you'll hear here, she's just a lovely person to listen to and to think alongside.
*  As always, if you have guest suggestions, feedback, things you think we should read,
*  my email is Ezra Klein Show at NYTimes.com.
*  Marion Wolf, welcome to the show.
*  Oh, what a pleasure it is to be able to talk to you, not just write letters to the New
*  York Times in reaction to your essay.
*  Write a lot of angry screeds.
*  That damn Ezra.
*  No anger, actually.
*  Total appreciation for the essay you wrote in August.
*  The medium really is the message.
*  Well, I appreciate that.
*  And we're going to talk about McLuhan and the mediums are the messages.
*  But I want to start here.
*  You argue in Read or Come Home that reading is a quote, a natural process.
*  Tell me what you mean by that.
*  Well, one of the striking insights that I had, if you will, a tiny epiphany.
*  When I first began to write about reading, which was in 2007, it was a book called Proust
*  and the Squid, the story and science of the reading brain, I realized that there was nothing
*  in the brain, not a single gene, not a single region that was specifically there for reading.
*  It's very unlike all the other processes that are actually incorporated in reading.
*  Language, vision, cognition, affect.
*  If you think about language, that is a natural process.
*  There's a genetic program in which it unfolds.
*  There's nothing like that for reading.
*  We were never meant to read.
*  What is amazing is that the brain does have this almost semi-miraculous capacity to make
*  new circuits within itself using the processes that are genetically there, but in new ways.
*  So what the brain has is the capacity to make novel circuits.
*  The invention, the human invention of reading required a new circuit.
*  So the brain very gradually learned how to connect parts that were there for other reasons
*  and made a new circuit that became the first underlying network for reading very simple
*  symbols 6,000 years ago.
*  It was never the case that we were meant to read, which has real implications.
*  The reason why it is essential to understand it's unnatural is that that circuit that is
*  formed, that novel circuit, is plastic.
*  That's what makes it very different from the other wonderful processes we were given by nature.
*  Well, one of the things I want to get at here before we get into plasticity and flexibility,
*  but without getting too deep into the neuroscience, one of the things that your book emphasizes
*  and that you convinced me of is that reading is a very misleading term because it's singular.
*  And you make this point that reading is not one thing at all.
*  It's many things.
*  So tell me a bit about that multiplicity.
*  I will return a little back to neuroscience only as a way of scaffolding what I'm going to say.
*  That is, when we first learn to read, we have this most basic circuit.
*  It's just putting together the visual processes that identify a letter or a character with a word,
*  with what we know about the word.
*  So it's putting vision and language together.
*  That's one form of reading.
*  That's a very basic form of what we would call decoding.
*  But from then on, according to our environment, we begin to elaborate that circuit.
*  And so we become prepared, if you will, to read in totally different ways from that very
*  simplified form of reading, which we call decoding.
*  And the more we know, the more we add to that circuit.
*  So the more we have as background knowledge, we are preparing that circuit to grow in ever
*  more sophisticated ways.
*  Now, the most interesting aspect for me about reading is that it's continuous.
*  It's evolving.
*  It's based on everything that went before.
*  Or it can be a very primitive way of using that decoding circuit so that we just are
*  skimming the top, if you will, of the processes and we get the information and we have a very
*  basic content.
*  But if over time we have begun to elaborate this brain so that it includes deep reading,
*  the unnatural apex of the achievement of reading is what deep reading provides.
*  And that means there are different levels in which we can participate in the text.
*  We can use our ability to take on another perspective to read in a whole different way.
*  We are entering almost like the theory of mind of another and also their feelings.
*  This is a totally different form of reading than the one that we are talking about when
*  we are saying we read for information.
*  Now, I can go and we'll go further into what's even, if you will, deeper than critical
*  analysis and empathy.
*  But the accrual of all these more sophisticated processes means that we can read at multiple
*  levels.
*  We can read with our attention simply skimming the surface.
*  And that's part of why Nicholas Carr used the term.
*  Shallows.
*  That's why some of my colleagues in Norway even talk about the shallowing hypothesis.
*  Many, many of us have, if you will, regressed to that earliest form of reading in which
*  we are barely skimming the surface of what we read, barely consolidating it in memory.
*  And we are, in fact, reading less of what is there as a result.
*  I'm really trying to decide if I want to keep the structure I intended here or jump around
*  a bit.
*  So let me say this because maybe it's a good way of signposting where I'm going for
*  everybody listening.
*  I'm interested in your work and I'm interested in this conversation because I'm interested
*  in the states you can achieve while reading.
*  And we talk about reading typically in terms of the content as if the question of reading
*  is what you read.
*  And what your work is getting at is that at least as important a question is how you read,
*  the process by which you read, the distractions, the physical formats, the qualities and levels
*  of attention you bring.
*  And this gets to something that you pointed out a minute or two ago, which is plasticity.
*  Talk a bit about plasticity and its relationship to reading.
*  The most important two words that I will use in this next part of the discussion are attention,
*  the quality of attention, and insight, epiphany.
*  There is a quick line between attention and shallow memory that is possible because we
*  have a plastic brain.
*  It doesn't tell us exactly what to do.
*  Rather, this plasticity is dependent on the medium in which we read, the language or writing
*  system or orthography in which we read, and even the educational background that taught
*  us how to read in particular ways.
*  Now, I bring us back to the two words, attention and insight.
*  Plasticity means that the way we read will be reflecting the affordances of the medium.
*  This was a point that McLuhan made, his student Walter Ong made, certainly Postman made,
*  as you indicated in your August essay.
*  All of these people were onto the basic principle that how we read on a medium changes
*  what we discern, what we comprehend.
*  Now, I'm going to push just slightly this plasticity into the affordances of digital
*  versus print.
*  The affordances of the digital screen are really exciting.
*  They help us skim the extraordinary voluminous nature of information that's out there.
*  Skimming is a defense mechanism that's very useful.
*  We can handle so much information.
*  Your job, Ezra and mine, involves six to ten hours a day of sampling information, if you will,
*  making sure we're aware.
*  But how we are reading it will change the nature of what we have absorbed.
*  And many people are asking me, in fact, I did an NPR program on why people don't feel the same
*  immersiveness in the reading experience.
*  And it's very simple because the affordances of the digital medium, which enhance the speed
*  in which we're reading and focusing on vast amounts of information, multitasking,
*  and being entertained, if you will, being engaged at that level,
*  all of that actually takes away from the ability to use the full circuitry,
*  the full circuitry, which includes using your background knowledge to infer, to deduce the truth
*  value, to feel what that author is feeling in a work of fiction, to understand a completely
*  different perspective.
*  All of that takes time.
*  The print medium's affordances advantage the giving, the allocation of time to words,
*  concepts, in a way that when we skim, we simply don't have the same amount of time to process.
*  So plasticity changes the nature of attention.
*  Attention is very sophisticated and complex, but the amount of attention that we have is going to
*  be influenced by all the distractions that you just discussed as you framed my question.
*  But it will lead, ultimately, to the diminution of the time necessary for the insights at the end.
*  I want to step away from, for a minute, the digital versus print, because before we get there,
*  I want to get a little bit more into this idea.
*  It's not just that mediums change us.
*  I was thinking about this language.
*  It's that habits change us.
*  It's that what we do again and again changes us.
*  So you have the term in your book, use it or lose it.
*  For something maybe as unnatural, as you put it, as reading, maybe a way of thinking about it is
*  build it or lose it.
*  But give me some examples of skills that we can strengthen or that we can weaken,
*  depending on how we read.
*  We develop, you call it habits, I call it mindsets, in which we develop a way of doing things.
*  With our background in print, we developed a very particular mindset that you possess,
*  Azra and I, as what we were, if you will, formed.
*  That's how we were formed as readers.
*  I call this moment in time technologically a hinge moment.
*  As we've moved to the other side of that hinge moment, we have made our habit of reading
*  largely on screens.
*  So imperceptibly, we are developing a mindset or habit of reading in a particular way that by
*  and large is based on a kind of skimming reading, again, because of all the information we have to
*  process in any given day.
*  So the habit or mindset is now so largely influenced by us reading on screens that we
*  take that mindset even back to print.
*  We can build habits of mind, a kind of reading that's after the innermost landscape of our
*  thinking, whether we call it the sanctuary of reading.
*  Proust always had something amazing to say about everything.
*  He saw the heart of reading as the place where we go beyond the wisdom of the author to discover
*  our own.
*  How do we build a habit of mind in which we decide from the start of whatever we are reading,
*  what is the purpose?
*  If the purpose is my shallow email, then I will skim with no guilt at all.
*  But if my intention or my purpose is to really understand something at ever deeper levels of
*  its complexity or to perceive the beauty of that carefully chosen word, when we are reading for
*  that purpose, for beauty, for understanding at the deepest level, then we have to really figure out
*  how to use either print out and use print or how to ensure that we can read on any medium
*  with the deep reading processes as our goal.
*  So I want to pause on that Proust quote because it's really the heart of this conversation too.
*  There's a state I get in less and less these days, but in part because of the way my world works and
*  my phone and my computers, I now associate it with plane flights because nobody can call me and I
*  don't buy internet.
*  It's a state that I only seem to access when reading and only when reading without distraction
*  for a long period of time.
*  It's very strange and it is one of my most loved states where on the one hand, I seem very focused
*  on the text.
*  At the same time, my thinking becomes expansive and associational to the point of Proust where
*  the wisdom goes beyond the author and into your own.
*  I seem to get flashes of insight that can unlock whole problems or open whole new avenues for
*  myself.
*  It's meditative but epiphanic and every time I get off of a plane, I say to myself,
*  I'm going to do that more.
*  I'm going to do that more.
*  I'm going to sit and I'm going to have quiet time with a book and this was so valuable and I got
*  three months of intellectual work done in four hours and then I don't.
*  First, I want to ask you, what is that state?
*  What is happening to me in that place where you enter into this almost fugue state of
*  reading and insight that you were not in when you opened the book?
*  First, I'm so glad that you understand your own insight.
*  I want to give you two completely different perspectives on this.
*  So you and I are going to do what the brain does.
*  We're going to do some heavy duty interactive associations of two different perspectives
*  on your question.
*  The first one is Aristotle.
*  Aristotle was writing about what makes a good society and he said there are three lives to
*  a good society.
*  The first life is the life of productivity and knowledge and cruel of information.
*  The second life that is in the Greek sense, leisure, entertainment, one has to have that.
*  But he said the third life that is essential is the life of reflection.
*  He used the word contemplation.
*  Now that is a perspective, let's call it the Aristotelian perspective,
*  in which the contemplative is going missing and we don't realize how important it is to
*  insight just the same thing that you experienced on a plane writ large, writ across everyone.
*  Where are our best insights?
*  Where are we going to have the space and time to give that next generation the full sum of
*  our wisdom?
*  So that's the Aristotelian perspective.
*  The second one is a more cognitive neuroscience one.
*  There was this one amazing set of researchers who were trying to deal with what's the aha
*  experience, what's the insight experience we have.
*  What they found was that the brain was activated everywhere it would see.
*  All these different regions in both hemispheres.
*  Well, I find the humor in that actually very helpful in understanding what you are talking
*  about because it illustrates that when we reach that state, we are activating all we know and
*  going beyond it.
*  We're making new connections and those new connections are the basis of novel thought.
*  And that's what we want for everyone to have as a piece of what it means to learn to read.
*  It's a mistake done by our educational system that sometimes we are emphasizing one thing
*  versus another, but we should all share the goal that that reading sanctuary, that innermost
*  landscape, that's where we go when we read our best.
*  And that's what reading gives us.
*  It gives us both our best thoughts, but it also is one of the best forms of communication
*  with others' best thoughts.
*  It's communicative and it's solitary.
*  And that's its own miracle.
*  You ran an interesting experiment.
*  Maybe that's a little bit too grand a word for it, but an interesting test on yourself
*  around this.
*  Tell me about reading Hermann Hesse's Magister Ludi again.
*  Yes.
*  So before I went to the neuroscience, I had two degrees in English and I really thought
*  I would study compilite, especially Rilke, Hermann Hesse.
*  It was a grand, grand scheme for my life.
*  And then I discovered the political reality of literacy in a Peace Corps-like thing.
*  Before I made the big switch to see literacy as a basic human right and pursue it to the
*  end of my days, I read Hermann Hesse with such love and affection.
*  I read everything.
*  I thought I read everything.
*  And Glaspeed Gang, Magister Ludi, Glasperlenspiel.
*  That was my favorite.
*  It was probably why he got the Nobel Prize for Literature.
*  And it represented for me the quest for knowledge.
*  So I decided since I'm writing and telling everybody else what terrible people they are
*  by not reading books in the way that I think we should, I thought I would test myself by
*  going back to Magister Ludi because I certainly knew the plot and I certainly knew there wasn't
*  going to be any murder or sex or anything else to distract me.
*  I could just immerse myself.
*  And so I did and utterly, completely failed to be able to even read the first part of the book.
*  It felt sluggish.
*  I think I said something like, Kreisot going across my cerebral hemispheres.
*  It was like, how could he've gotten a Nobel Prize?
*  I wouldn't have given a Nobel Prize for this.
*  And I put the book back.
*  So I tried again.
*  I went back just at a personal peak in myself and I thought I would try again.
*  And so I only allowed myself to read a few minutes a day for a while.
*  And basically, Ezra, what I had to do is slow myself down.
*  I thought I was reading online and in print with the same immersive qualities as I had as an
*  English major.
*  But I had lost that.
*  I'd lost my most beloved home and I hadn't known it.
*  So it took about two weeks before I could get the pace necessary that would match the book.
*  I found my home again and then I read it another time.
*  And that was finally the time in which I could remember the pleasure of just deep diving into
*  another world and being there with no distraction.
*  But it took real work to recover that, Ezra.
*  I had not realized how far I had strayed from that form of reading myself.
*  I wonder if there isn't an answer to what I think should be understood as a quite profound
*  mystery of our age in that.
*  And this is a suspicion I've had for a bit.
*  So we live in this age in which one of the fundamental scarcities of all of human civilization
*  and existence has been lifted, which is information.
*  The amount of information any individual being had access to 100 years ago to say nothing of a
*  thousand was so minuscule, so bounded compared to what is possible for us to know now, to share now,
*  to access now.
*  And so you would think having lifted the constraint on what we can know and what we can share,
*  that you would see something, economic growth,
*  the depth of our democracies, our societal wisdom and humaneness accelerate.
*  Something of the early utopian beliefs about the internet would come true.
*  Instead, you look around and growth is not faster than it was 50 years ago.
*  We do not see more wise.
*  Our politics is not more elevated, to say the least.
*  And I think what you're saying, and I think many people have sensed, might be at least a partial
*  explanation.
*  We made it possible to have so much more information in a way that made it impossible or
*  more difficult to reflect upon and develop insights upon that information.
*  And as such, we increased information but reduced judgment.
*  And so as you say, we're not passing on our best thoughts, but it's also weirdly why the
*  information we have access to isn't creating some civilization-wide betterment.
*  Because it turned out the information was never enough.
*  It's what we did with it, what we thought about it, the connections we made with it.
*  And we've degraded those capacities at wide scale, even as we've increased connectivity
*  and quantity of what we can know.
*  So the very bombardment, the very volume is causing people ultimately to go only to the
*  familiar sources of that information.
*  And then they become calcified into thinking in those, if you will, reduced terms, which by
*  and large, this is a term used by many people, is part of the confirmatory bias characteristic
*  that's happening with information.
*  You go to your familiar source, you don't try on other perspectives, it's too much.
*  So you become, instead of more informed, informed only about one particular perspective on that
*  information.
*  You are not using your critical analytic capacities to discern truth, and therefore
*  you are totally susceptible to miss and disinformation and ultimately demagoguery.
*  Everything I have done, which was meant to be an apologia for reading, led me to a darker
*  insight, which is that the very act of reading has become so degraded because of the bombardment
*  of information, because of the affordances of the particular medium, and because we have become all,
*  all of us, cognitively impatient.
*  We don't want to spend the time.
*  Let me hold you there, because I want to question the word want, and I want to bring this back in
*  the way to neuroplasticity.
*  You talk at times about the opposite of cognitive impatience, which is cognitive patience.
*  But when we exist in a digital world in particular, that is so constantly assaulting us with
*  novelty, what I understand happens to the mind is it begins to expect and even crave novelty.
*  And so this is one of the places where I have a real fear about myself, about my sons, about my
*  society, that we are training ourselves, are training our minds away from cognitive patience,
*  which isn't just, maybe it is for some people a virtue, but it's also a capacity.
*  Can you talk a bit about that dimension of it, the part that's not about what we want to do,
*  but about what our brains become used to doing?
*  There's a term that people use in this area called the novelty bias, and that's a reflex
*  that goes all the way back to our hunter-gatherer days, in which to see what was unusual was to
*  preserve our life, whether it was a predator that we were able to avoid, or make a strategy to avoid,
*  or whether it's something that we could eat and not be poisoned, but survival itself dependent
*  on that novelty reflex. Now that novelty reflex is now being hyper stimulated from infancy on,
*  and I make a really hard point with my pediatric colleagues like Barry Zuckerman and John Hutton
*  from Cincinnati. All of these people are really trying hard to insist we don't inure our children
*  to distraction and novelty because they are complete victims to the novelty reflex.
*  Anything distracts them, and they are becoming hyper stimulated. So even though you were talking
*  about cognitive patience being formed, I will say it's being malformed, disformed from the start
*  by parents not realizing that these screens are not babysitters, but that they are shaping the
*  demand for attention and novelty in our young. So your statement about cognitive patience being
*  a capacity that can be learned is something that I really want to help parents and educators
*  understand. We all have a role to play. We have a role to play in being a model,
*  but we have a role to play in what we expose our children to and how many hours and when.
*  So it's a capacity that I think our educational system of the future and the present has to
*  really figure out, and we haven't figured it out.
*  AC I was thinking about this reading your book. So I have two sons, one is one year old and one is
*  almost four. And I was thinking about how for my four year old, it isn't his distractedness that
*  worries me. It's his focus. And I say this because particularly since he got a brother,
*  screen time rules are not what they once were in my house. And so he's on all the time, but
*  but it's so noticeable with a little kid. There is so little he can pay attention to for long
*  periods except the screen. I was reading in this wonderful newspaper that hosts this podcast,
*  there was a feature about Cocoa Melon, which is this show of functionally animated nursery rhymes
*  that like two and three year olds love and adults hate. But they talk about in this feature,
*  how they have set up a room, the place that makes Cocoa Melon, where they will have a kid watching
*  the show and set up next to it is another screen that shows an adult just doing normal household
*  tasks, just sort of wandering around doing whatever you do in the house. And if the child
*  becomes distracted from Cocoa Melon by what the adult is doing, they go back to the edit,
*  and they amp up the interestingness, the cuts, the whatever makes a Cocoa Melon episode interesting.
*  And it was so dystopic, right, that the level of engineering, I mean, the hyper saturation of the
*  colors, the constant cuts. And so I mean, a little bit like, you know, hyper sugary cereal or whatever,
*  what his system is learning to find worth paying attention to, right, like how hard it is for the
*  world to measure up to that, as it is for me, I'm going to bring this to me in a second. So don't,
*  I'm not just putting this on little kids. But I know every time I put them there, it is training,
*  right? It is training about what's interesting and what's not. I mean, in a weird way, like the
*  natural state of the kid should be distracted. I can't have him distracted all the time,
*  because I sometimes need to like clean dishes. But it is really unnerving.
*  DL It's unnerving. And it's also,
*  there's a certain unconscionable aspect that has happened. And that is that those of us who really
*  believed that, and I know you and I actually believed similarly 10, 12 years ago, that the
*  forces of the good would prevail with this medium and this culture. But what has happened is that
*  profit and other motivations have not just made sure that engagement was taking place,
*  but that the same formula that casino gamblers use to give intermittent reinforcement, plus those
*  ways of engagement, so that the child is addicted. But what you said, and I'll return back to your
*  child, is that he can't focus the same in the ways that you would hope. And that's because
*  he's hyper stimulated. He is being molded. The same things that are making a gambler addicted
*  in a very small way, that's happening with our children. So those of us who are studying this
*  from a neuroscience viewpoint, like John Hutton, we can tell you, I can tell you right now what we
*  call the Goldilocks study, where a parent reads a story, the same story as then in an audio form
*  just heard by the child. This is a three-year-old or a four-year-old, or it's animated in a screen.
*  Well, you know that they are paying very close attention to that screen, but what you don't know
*  is if you do or look at the activation of the language regions of the brain under all three of
*  those circumstances, language is being activated most by when a parent or caretaker is reading that
*  same story. The passivity is gone out the window. There is an interactive nature to it, and there
*  is a use of their language knowledge and their background knowledge that's coming to bear more
*  forcefully in that print situation and more passively in the screen situation.
*  And so, of course, you have differences in concentration, you have differences in attention.
*  Walter Benjamin said that boredom is the hatch bird of the imagination. Well, our children,
*  the first thing they do after they go off the screen is say,
*  I'm bored. But this is not Walter Benjamin's boredom. This is boredom that seeks to, if you will,
*  assuage its need for hyperstimulation by getting more. This is something that we must figure out.
*  It's funny, I think there's something almost comforting about putting this on the kids,
*  and I promise I won't spend the whole time we have together on parenting, but this is something
*  that occurred to me in an unpleasant way reading your chapters about children, which is it's easy
*  to talk about the way kids growing up with modern screens. I grew up with TV, streaming is totally
*  different because anything can be on at any minute. The iPad is a whole other level of engagement for
*  my son. But it's true for the parents too. I was thinking about how my engagement with screens
*  means that there's always a possibility of something, at least plausibly, really interesting.
*  And kids are often, no offense to them, quite boring. They need you to sit around during a lot
*  of things that are not the most engaging thing that I can possibly imagine doing. And I, as a
*  parent, and basically all the parents I know, you know, will sometimes collapse to the screen
*  because I too like am hooked into the novelty. And as such, I am not there playing make believe
*  or reading or whatever it might be that isn't the way this acts on children, I guess is what I'm
*  saying is not just because we put the kids in front of the screens, but because we put the parents
*  want to get back to their screens to the point that now I try if I go to the playground with them,
*  I don't bring a try not to bring my phone unless there's some reason I really need it
*  because I can't stop myself. Exactly. Which is also very strange.
*  You are as addicted as anyone. We all are. What I'm trying to get at with this question
*  is you're just bringing up how different it is for the child to have the parents attention.
*  And the parents are inattentive too. What does that mean for children?
*  So they are being given a constant model. And if you look at children, you'll see that they are,
*  among other things, great imitators. So one of the more horrifying aspects of that Goldilocks
*  study that I told you, where parents came in and read to their child or they saw it. Well,
*  one of the things that happened was that John Hutton saw some of the parents reading to their
*  child and then turning every 30 seconds to check their email. And this was like the perfect example.
*  The very act of being a caretaker, an interactive reader to your child is being disrupted by the
*  addiction of the parent to social media or whatever is on their phone. This is a part of reality
*  that parents need to face in themselves. If we are to model, then we must model not only
*  good uses of technology, but good uses of time itself that isn't devoted or distracted by technology.
*  Let me ask you about how we use our phones, because there's something a little
*  paradoxical here. On the one hand, we're reading more words than ever. I mean,
*  we're constantly reading words. In some ways, it's a paradise for readers for reading. But this gets
*  a bit at this idea that we talked about at the beginning, that reading is not any one thing.
*  And we mentioned earlier, scanning, and it also brings into play here scrolling, the fact that
*  the screen moves while you're looking at it. What have you learned in your research and the research
*  of your colleagues about what is different when we're reading in this scanning scrolling way that
*  phones and screens demand? I've been doing a lot of work with colleagues like Naomi Barron, who
*  has an Oxford book called How We Read Now. My colleagues in Norway in the e-read network.
*  We're all trying to understand what are these characteristics of skimming, scanning, scrolling.
*  And one of the things that is most obvious is that your ability to comprehend and sequence
*  detail when you're skimming or scanning goes out the door. Now, one of the things that goes out the
*  door along with it is called comprehension monitoring. Now, when we're reading, let's say
*  print, by and large, this is not noticeable to yourself, but you're checking. You've gone left,
*  you've gone right, you're always going a little ahead, but you're also going back to check.
*  This comprehension monitoring is not going to be at the fore when what you are doing is in fact
*  trying to get to the end. You are missing monitoring. So you are missing sometimes
*  very important details in a plot or in an essay. So there are several things that contribute to
*  that. The first is the speed with which you are accustomed to skimming, scanning, scrolling. Now,
*  remember the eye movement people are studying this and they're seeing that's what most of us
*  are doing. When you're skimming and scrolling, you can easily just stay at the level of the tip
*  of the iceberg because you are being hastened along, not poised to think about what you're reading.
*  CB So it's a bit of an experiment. When I was reading your book, I alternated between reading
*  chapters in the physical book, the paperback, and on my Kindle, which is actually where I do most of
*  my reading. I love my Kindle because my memory is trash, and I guess we'll talk about that,
*  and the ability to highlight and keep all my highlights centrally located and searchable is
*  really valuable to me. But I did really notice something that you just said when I was reading
*  the book and paper, which is I noticed how much more often I went backwards,
*  how much easier it was and more natural it was somehow to move around in the book.
*  On the Kindle, if I've sort of zoned out on something, it's lost. I'm
*  past that. I'm going forward. It's not obviously impossible to go back, and sometimes I do,
*  but I noticed how much more often in the book I moved backwards as well as forwards
*  or noticed that I had lost attention for a little bit. There is something about the physicality of
*  it that made moving through the space of it different in ways that I suspect probably did
*  help my comprehension. BT When you ask me where something is in a book, I have a visual sense
*  it's on the bottom third of the page. It's about a fourth of the way through,
*  and of course I write all through my book. So I have a visual spatial image for some of the things
*  that are most important in what I read, and there is no way we do that on screen or audio.
*  And I use both, and I listen to books, but we don't monitor. You can go back. I mean,
*  just as you said, you can go back, but you never do. And so things go missing,
*  and the things that go missing may in some instances be the most important
*  facts or details to understanding the plot or understanding the argument.
*  AC But let me take the other side of this, because what I said about the Kindle is also true.
*  Memory is a very weak facility. Now there's some evidence it's gotten weaker, and you can go back
*  to, I don't know, is it Socrates or Aristotle who says that writing is going to be bad because then
*  we're not going to remember anything. BT Right. The recipe for forgetting.
*  AC Yeah, maybe if we never had writing, I'd have an amazing memory and I wouldn't feel this way.
*  But there are real advantages to digital text. And so is maybe some of this that we're just in a
*  transition time. It took a long time to figure out how to read, figure out how to do books.
*  For a long time, most people couldn't read, and books were reserved for the elite.
*  And we are still learning about digital text, but there are very, very clear advantages.
*  And that as we are able to develop them more deeply, we will recognize it just as it's better
*  to have writing and reading than to not. It's much, much, much, much better to have these
*  digital worlds than to not. I mean, are you and I just cranky? Are we the equivalent of our parents?
*  We're like, the VCR is too complicated and it's always distracting me.
*  BT You have often quoted or have at least recently often quoted McLuhan.
*  And McLuhan's basic protege was this amazing scholar, Walter Ahn. And he, I think, said it
*  better than I can. He said, the problem is not orality, oral culture versus illiterate culture.
*  The problem is figuring out what to do when we are steeped in both. And that's how I
*  conceptualize what I call this hinge moment between the technologies represented rudely
*  by illiterate versus a digital culture. There's no going back. We are much better served by
*  thinking about what Ahn said, what do we do for those steeped in both. And so my job,
*  as I conceptualize it, is to be not Cassandra or someone only talking about the negative
*  aspects of digital, but to say we must not be ignorant of what we are disrupting or diminishing.
*  And so for almost all my lectures, I end with something that will say preserve as we expand.
*  And that's what my goal for others is, to understand what we are disrupting and to figure
*  out ways to build habits of mind, habits of the reading mind that we can use with purposefulness,
*  whatever medium we're on.
*  It's part of the issue here that we have operated with the wrong metaphor. So I wonder whether
*  we have gotten too into what I think of as the the matrix jack theory of learning.
*  I have always wanted the thing in the matrix where they put the little needle in the back
*  of your head into the jack and then you know, Kung Fu. There's so many books I've said to people
*  that I want to have read the book. And it took a long time. It's actually Nicholas Carr's book
*  that began to the shallows. It began to make me think differently about this, but to realize that
*  it was the time I spent in the book that really mattered. There was a quote from Sam Bankman
*  Fried that was making the rounds. Sam Bankman Fried being the former head of FTX, his crypto
*  exchange had collapsed. And he says in there that he's very skeptical of books. He thinks mostly
*  books should not be books. They should be six paragraph blog posts. And if somebody's written
*  both a book and more six paragraph blog posts that I can count, even when the book is expanding
*  an idea that could be shorter, some of its value for the reader is actually the time spent there
*  wrestling. And I wonder if the point of this a little bit isn't that we think much too much
*  about the information we pass on to ourselves or teach children in schools and not enough about the
*  states that we're spending time in. And as such the circuits in the mind that we are deepening
*  and strengthening versus letting languish that like we've gotten too hung up on products as opposed
*  to process. I think that you are putting just a beautiful metaphor, if you will, for what's
*  important. And it's not information. We need facts. This is Aristotle's three lies,
*  but we need contemplation and we have forgotten our need for it. But we also need something else.
*  And it's the isotope of knowledge or insight is feeling that's so important.
*  I've been reading Hermann Hesse again. And one of the things he did at the end of his life was write
*  a poem about books. And he said, all the books in the world will not bring you happiness,
*  but build a secret path towards your heart. Let's not forget the heart as we battle what is best for
*  the mind, because the heart, the affective aspect of reading is one of the most beautiful things
*  that leads to that inner sanctuary. But it's part of what happens on the journey to insight,
*  the feelings that we have, the feelings that an author elicits to us. That's a form of knowledge.
*  We need heart and brain as we look at what reading gives us and what we experience
*  when we're reading or not.
*  I'm going to ask a couple of questions here about ways forward, but one of them is about this. I
*  mean, if you're listening to this conversation and you're thinking, oh, you know, I also have
*  lost some of this faculty, what is the training program to rediscover it look like? What is the
*  Mary Ann Wolf plan for refreshing your deep reading skills look like?
*  So you might laugh, but I call it bookends, the bookends to a day. And I'm very serious about
*  the two ends of the day. Now with a one and a four-year-old, Ezra, I don't know how I feel guilty
*  telling you this, but I begin my day with meditation and then reading at least 20 minutes
*  of philosophical or theological or spiritual or sometimes political, something that will
*  absolutely take me out of myself and center me, completely center my thinking, slow it down. It
*  prepares me for, if you will, clearing the deck of whatever detritus from the night or even the
*  day before and readying myself with a particular mindset for whatever the day brings. And then at
*  the end of the day, I do two things that may or may not be helpful to people, especially people
*  with young children. And that is I have to find a way for the world of imagination to
*  take me away from the work of the day. Sometimes it's films, sometimes it's novels, but
*  it has to be something truly in the world of imagination for me. And then I end that,
*  because I don't want to be on a screen at the very end of my day. I often end it with some essay
*  by Montaigne. I mean, that sounds really strange, but he was the first essay writer
*  and those essays are sometimes really funny, sometimes really boring, but whatever they are,
*  they give me a kind of piece that I find in very few places. Wendell Berry, Marcus Aurelius,
*  those are the kinds of people who make me feel the peace at the end of the day is something that
*  is really well worth striving for. So I end and I begin each day with books.
*  I'm honestly skeptical of reading practices that are about the end of the day.
*  Maybe it's because I have young kids, as you mentioned, but my reading at the end of the day
*  I do it. I mean, I fall asleep looking at my Kindle basically every night, but it associates
*  reading with sleep and I don't get anywhere deep with it. In fact, I've had to learn that if I'm
*  going to do real deep reading, it has to be possible sometimes for me to fall asleep for
*  20 minutes during the day. So I'm actually curious about practices that are not about the end of the
*  day or the beginning of the day, because they're also for a lot of people, those are not plausible
*  times to have the energy to make this a priority. Like if you really want to do this in the way that
*  people work out in the way that they learn a new hobby, if you want to make this part of your week
*  to rediscover or retrain yourself as a deep reader, what does it take? Is it just doing it?
*  Is it something more than that? Like what is the version of this that is not in the corners of your
*  time? That's such a good question for everyone, because there are such individual differences
*  about what helps us return to that center, that inner landscape. And I leave it to the individual,
*  I have the advantage of having my children grown, I can do this sort of book ending my day,
*  but the real point isn't the book ending. The real point is to remember, to restore the, what is it,
*  Lorca said, that ancient soul of a child. I think each of us have this busyness that just,
*  we assume we are the indispensable managers of our days and times when really we aren't giving
*  ourselves just the tiniest break in being a manager, but rather being just a thinker with
*  a heart and a mind and a soul. And so what I would suggest is if anyone can find a secret place in
*  their day, a secret corner, maybe it's 10 minutes, maybe it's 20, where they can go off,
*  whether it's with a book or with music or with something that will just give them a chance
*  to remember who they are, who their best selves are. That's not a book end, that's finding
*  a corner of the day to refine ourselves. I actually do it with music sometimes instead of reading,
*  I've discovered a composer, a Korean composer named Yee Rooma, and I will play a haunting piece
*  and it will elicit for me something similar. So again, there's these individual differences.
*  Reading leads to this apex, but other things can too.
*  CB Let me ask you about another proposal you make in the book, this one more far reaching,
*  which is the biliterate brain and the ways in which we should be encouraging and explicitly
*  teaching a biliterate brain. What is the biliterate brain?
*  BT So I want to actually state that in my work, I'm using the term biliterate in a very particular
*  way to refer to mediums. It begins in a parallel between digital and print exposure, in which in
*  the beginning, print is the medium of choice to surround that child, especially in the zero to two
*  and then two to five period. Digital can be there, but like another teddy bear, not something used
*  as a reward or as a punishment of any sort, neither, but just as something that is part of
*  the environment, the landscape, never as a babysitter, but that there would be reading
*  every single night to the child from the parents or caretakers, every single night.
*  And then between five and ten, again, print being the dominant medium, but the parallel is that
*  our children in Reggio, Emilia in Italy just shows how this can happen. They can learn programming
*  and coding and all these wonderful cognitive capacities that go with digital. They can do that
*  simultaneously, but that they're doing parallel tracks. They come together when the aspects from
*  digital can be complementary to books and print, but not dominate reading between five and ten.
*  At somewhere between ten and twelve, thirteen, my hope is that teachers across the world
*  will really have this aim of deep reading processes, of critical analysis and empathy,
*  being at the core of what we teach our children. Tommy Cutseer from Israel has this program called
*  Islands of Understanding for that age group. And I so admire her because what she's doing is she's
*  putting literacy and the study of empathy together. And this is what I really want us to do
*  as we then teach our children to use those deep reading processes on the screen. Again,
*  always asking what is the purpose, never using print or digital aimlessly, but purposefully
*  so that those deep reading skills, the inner sanctuary is a well-known landscape to the
*  individual child and to us. So I really have a great deal of hope. My colleague Marina
*  Bares in Boston at Boston College talks, and we have had long discussions together, about
*  the different cognitive capacities that are being advantaged by these different mediums.
*  And we shouldn't be thinking about them as being either in competition or in conflict,
*  but learn them and then learn and teach teachers to help integrate them
*  in whatever reading the child is doing past 10 when they're fluent, we hope.
*  Let me ask about the other side of this and for adults. So I already asked you how someone might
*  rediscover, retrain their deep reading tendencies. But a lot of us, most of us maybe,
*  are going to induce spend a lot of time staring at a screen, skimming with distractions everywhere.
*  And to the point of the bilateral brain, there is doubtlessly good in that as well as bad. It's
*  easy to focus, I think, on the bad, but surfing a lot of information, being able to see a lot
*  of different things, picking through things. How do you think about doing that well? A suspicion
*  I have, I mentioned earlier that maybe we're just in this lag time. This is all very new.
*  And maybe we'll look forward 20, 50, 100 years and people will look at us, think, oh, they were
*  terrible at using that. They had no idea what they were doing. In terms of training, using, building
*  what is good about these functions, how do you think about, or how do you for yourself
*  try to manage your digital reading, your digital life, to get the best out of it,
*  as opposed to the worst out of it? The first thing I do is understand the purpose of whatever I'm
*  reading. Why am I reading this? And there, I would say 60% of my day with the digital
*  reading I do is to find out whether I should or should not do something more. By and large,
*  I don't. But if in the skimming, scrolling that I do like everybody else, I realize this is something
*  I really need to understand, I really need to do something about, then I become a different reader.
*  If I don't have access to print, I completely slow myself down. I make sure I'm taking notes. And
*  I physically take notes. I am full of notebooks. And I know I could use this note taking capacity
*  on the screen. I do not. I find that the actual act, which is also true for children,
*  the Graff-O-Motor Act helps my memory and consolidation. And so while 60%, I don't do
*  anything differently from anyone else, all those things that I consider important, I either print
*  out or I take very careful notes. And I am aware after that experiment of how vulnerable I am,
*  like everybody else, to the quick skim. When it's useful, great. When it's not useful,
*  then I have to act differently and read differently.
*  TITLE CARD So then let me ask you what is always our final question here, which is what are three
*  books that have influenced you that you would recommend to the audience? I'm sure this one will
*  be very easy for you. TITLE CARD Oh, this is so horrible. I told Annie that I was not going to
*  obey your rules, but I will try to stay within limits. First is my favorite novelist, American
*  female novelist, and that's Marilynne Robinson. Her Gilead Home, Lila, Jack, the trilogy Gilead is
*  one of the most beautiful novels, I think, of the 20th century, 20th, 21st century.
*  TITLE CARD Yeah, I think Gilead is in my top five books.
*  TITLE CARD I don't know how many times I've read it. In fact, I was with Marilynne Robinson once
*  in a car and we were reciting Emily Dickinson poems together. And she's just an astonishing,
*  astonishing person. So that's my first. My second is my friend Gish Jen, who unbelievably can write
*  even about dystopia with a sense of humor and wit. That was in her book, The Resisters.
*  But I would really actually want to say that my favorite was her book, World in Town,
*  in which like few other people, she helps us understand what it means to be in a different
*  culture and to have the same goals for humanity, but from a completely different stance. And so
*  those would be two that I suggest. The third will be very difficult for me because it's something
*  between Wendell Berry's Standing By Words and John Donne, the theologian's Love's Mine, which is
*  Essays on Contemplation. So those three were really hard for me to do, but those are the ones I have
*  come up with. TITLE CARD
*  I like that somewhere between three and three and nine, but those are wonderful suggestions.
*  I didn't say Middlemarch and my children, if I don't say Middlemarch, will say,
*  Mom, you lied to Ezra Klein. Middlemarch is your favorite book. So I have to say that at the end.
*  I love it. Marianne Wolf, your book is Reader. Come home. Thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Ezra. A true pleasure.
*  TITLE CARD
