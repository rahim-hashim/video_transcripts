# Ezra Klein Debates Vivek Ramaswamy on Trump's Universal Tariff
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk)
*  So in this, you sound a little bit more to me, like where the Biden administration is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=0.0s)]
*  than where Donald Trump is. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=5.98s)]
*  Trump, right, has a 10 or 20 percent, depending on which speech he's giving, tariff on all [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=7.44s)]
*  imported goods from anybody, be they friend or foe. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=12.88s)]
*  Biden's actually kept most of the Trump tariffs intact. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=16.56s)]
*  And then the next thing we could talk about- Right, but he's not trying to create a universal [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  tariff. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=21.64s)]
*  Well, that's, that's an, if he kept all the tariffs that he supposedly would have [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=22.64s)]
*  opposed it from Donald Trump- No, no, no, he's not trying to create a 10 or 20 percent [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=25.52s)]
*  universal tariff. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=28.52s)]
*  I think, I think we can get into the essence of what Donald Trump is also trying to do, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=30.04s)]
*  which I think is a little different than what you characterized. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=34.04s)]
*  He's proposing a 10 or 20 percent universal tariff. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  I think he's using the threat of tariffs to be able to accomplish other goals as a negotiator. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=37.6s)]
*  So you don't think he will do the thing that he's saying he will do? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=41.0s)]
*  I think that he's using, Donald Trump is all about, with respect to the international stage, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=43.36s)]
*  using our leverage to the maximum extent possible. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=47.2s)]
*  So we have to sort of assume secret knowledge of what Donald Trump is going to do. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think that he's proven himself to be an apt negotiator for the United States [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=52.56s)]
*  in getting other countries to pony up in contexts where they haven't in the past. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Jmyu9khxk&t=56.4s)]
