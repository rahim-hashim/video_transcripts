# Matthew Desmond On America’s Addiction to Poverty
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [April 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8d1nFYVvNg)
*  I'm Ezra Klein. This is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Books about poverty tend to be books about the poor. Matthew Desmond writes that in his
*  new book about poverty, Poverty by America. But Poverty by America is supposed to be something
*  a bit different. It's a book about everyone who benefits from the poor, their existence,
*  their exploitation, all the people more comfortable with the perpetuation of poverty than with
*  what would be demanded of them for its abolition. So this is a book, in other words, not so
*  much about the poor as it is about the rest of us. Desmond is a sociologist at Princeton.
*  He's author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Evicted. And Evicted, which was a book about
*  housing markets, particularly for the poor, it was a smash hit. It was beloved by Desmond's
*  fellow social scientists. His new book has been a lot more controversial. It parted two
*  disagreements about the way he reads the poverty data. And so we talk about that. There's a
*  good wonky bit here about how to measure poverty. But I also want to keep people focused on
*  the big picture here. America has a lot of poverty. It could, if it chose, have much,
*  much less poverty. So the question of why that choice isn't made year after year, that
*  is really a question worth asking. As always, my email is reclineshow at ny times.com.
*  Matt Desmond, welcome to the show.
*  It's great to be here.
*  So I want to begin with you, because something you say in the book, which I didn't realize
*  from past work is that you come up with the subject from really your own perspective.
*  Tell me a bit about your own history with poverty and how it led you to this inquiry.
*  I grew up in a little railroad town in Arizona, northern Arizona, Winslow, which is an Eagle
*  song. And my dad was a pastor and we never had a lot of money. Things were tight. Our
*  gas got turned off from time to time. And then we lost our home when I was in college.
*  And I think that experience worked its way inside of me, made me see how poverty diminishes
*  and stresses a family. And then I kind of took that to Milwaukee for my last book and
*  followed families getting evicted and saw a level of poverty that I've just never seen
*  before or experienced. I saw grandmas living without heat in the winter, just piling under
*  blankets. I saw kids getting evicted on a routine basis. And I kind of saw a hard bottom
*  layer of deprivation that was just shocking and disturbing.
*  You mentioned losing your family's home when you were in college. And that brings up the
*  book that other people may know you for earlier, Evicted. But for people who aren't as familiar
*  with that dimension of your work, tell me a bit about that book, the nature of the research
*  that led to it and how in a large scale way it changed your thinking on the structure
*  of American poverty.
*  So for Evicted, I moved into a mobile home park on the south side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
*  And I lived there for about four or five months. And then I moved into a rooming house on the
*  north side of the city. It's the inner city of Milwaukee. And I lived there for about 10
*  months. And from those two neighborhoods, followed families getting evicted and went
*  everywhere with those families, followed them to eviction court and to shelters, abandoned homes,
*  watched their kids, slept on their floor, ate from their table, went to a bunch of funerals,
*  went to a birth. But I also recognize that if I wanted to understand how the low income
*  housing market worked, I needed to get close to landlords too. So I got just as close to
*  landlords doing the evicting as I did with tenants getting evicted. And I helped them
*  pass out eviction notices and fix up their properties. And I learned a bit more about
*  what makes landlords tick and what ticks them off. And Evicted is the result of that work.
*  It's a way of saying, look, if we're going to understand inequality in America today,
*  we have to understand the human cost of the housing crisis. And for me, seeing that toll
*  on people, seeing folks lose not only their homes, but their neighborhoods, kids losing
*  their schools, families often lose all their stuff, which is piled on the street by movers or
*  taken by neighbors. It takes so much time and money to build up at a home and eviction could
*  just delete all that. Eviction comes with a mark, a blemish. It's a court order. And that can prevent
*  you from moving into a good neighborhood and a good home because many landlords see that blemish
*  and say, no. So we pushed those families into bad neighborhoods and we pushed those families
*  into really degrading housing situations. And on and on it goes. And I think that my conclusion
*  was that no, eviction isn't just a condition of poverty. It's a cause of poverty. It's making
*  things worse. It can be easy. And I'm certainly guilty of this at times to try to apprehend
*  questions like eviction, like poverty by reading some big policy reports, by looking at macro data,
*  by trying to follow the lines on the chart. Do you do a bunch of that in this book? And you've done
*  a bunch of that in your work. And there is a dimension of work that is quite quantitative.
*  But what do you think you see differently when you actually immerse yourself in it? What looks
*  different from the ground than from the appendix table? I think that it means that I'm accountable
*  to folks that are struggling in a different way. In the university, there's this old line that you
*  have to have some distance and some objectivity to study a problem with rigor and truthfulness.
*  And distance is not the problem of the university. We have plenty of distance. And I think when you
*  get proximate to families that are enduring a level of hardship that so many of us can't even
*  imagine, it really washes over you. It makes you accountable to the problem in a different way.
*  I think we can write about these issues with conviction and rigor and truth and about people
*  who we love and care about deeply. So in this new book, I write about my friends. And I call them
*  my friends. I don't call them my research subjects because they're not. They're people that I've done
*  a lot of life with. And I think that experience not only is incredibly educational. I learned so
*  much from just being on the ground with folks that are struggling. But it's also this amazing reminder
*  how beautifully and elegantly and gracefully people refuse to be reduced to their hardships,
*  how poverty has not stolen folks' humanity. Tell me a bit about the scale of the poverty
*  problem in America today. How would you describe it? There is so much poverty in this rich land.
*  If you just look at the official metric of poverty, there's 38 million of us that can't afford basic
*  necessities, which means if folks below the official poverty line formed their own country,
*  that country would be bigger than Australia. It would be bigger than Venezuela.
*  But the poverty line is very low. And there's plenty of economic hardship above the poverty line.
*  One in three people in America live in a home, which is bringing in $55,000 or less, one in three
*  of us. Now, many of those aren't officially counted among the poor, but what else do you call trying
*  to get by on $55,000 or less and raising two kids in Portland or Miami? But poverty is not just a
*  line. It's not just an income level. Poverty is often pain and sickness. It's living in degraded
*  housing. It's the fear of eviction. It is eviction and the homelessness. It's getting roughed up by
*  the police sometimes. It's schools that are just bursting at the seams. It's neighborhoods where
*  everyone around you is also struggling. It's death. Death come early. Death come often.
*  So for me, poverty isn't a line. It's this tight knot of agonies and humiliations and social
*  problems. And this is experienced by millions of us in the richest country in the history of the
*  world. How's it changed over time? So it depends what metric you use. If you look at the official
*  poverty line, it hasn't changed a lot. 1973, 50 years ago, there was 11% poverty. In 2018,
*  12%. Not a lot of change. But the official poverty measure is flawed. It doesn't account
*  for a lot of regional variation and housing costs. It doesn't count certain kind of government
*  programs like food stamps, housing assistance. So in 2011, the census launched a new poverty
*  measure, the supplemental poverty measure. And researchers at Columbia figured out a way
*  to take that new poverty line and stretch it out over time. And when you do that, you kind of come
*  to the same conclusion. The supplemental poverty line, historically, in 1973 was 15.1%. In 2013,
*  40 years later, it was 15.5%. In 2018, it was 13%. So it had dipped down a little bit. That's just
*  not a lot of progress. In COVID, the supplemental poverty measure plunged to historic lows because
*  of this bold relief that was issued by the federal government. Things like the child tax credit and
*  emergency rental assistance. But over the long view, a lot of measures are showing poverty being
*  incredibly stubborn and stagnant. One thing about the supplemental poverty line, which I've seen
*  really frustrating, a lot of people work on the poverty issue and I think are aligned with you on
*  solutions, is that where you start those dials really ends up mattering. So you look at 1967,
*  you see poverty falling from 25% then to about 8.4% in 2020 amidst all that stimulus spending.
*  I think this matters because there's a real question as to whether or not these government
*  programs are effective. You'll hear people on the right say constantly, the great society did
*  nothing. You spend more money on poor people, you get more poor people. And the supplemental
*  measure and some other measures that measure consumption do seem to show pretty sharp and
*  significant drops over time. So defend for me a little bit more this idea that there's not been
*  real progress, which is different than not enough progress.
*  Yeah, this is hard. And I think that we should all confront the problem of counting poor families
*  with a lot of humility, a lot of curiosity. So one way to think about this is to say,
*  okay, if poverty has declined, have other hardship measures also declined? If we're seeing falling
*  rates of poverty, we should see falling rates of eviction. We should see debt going down. We should
*  see homelessness going down. But in recent years, we haven't seen that. Since 2000, eviction filings
*  have increased by about 22%. Since 2000, the share of families who visit food pantries have
*  increased by almost 19%. The number of homeless public school kids in America has increased by
*  over 74% since the Great Recession. Since the late 1990s, the number of families reporting no
*  cash income but drawing on food stamps has more than quadrupled. These are really troubling signs
*  on the horizon. And it suggests that measures that are showing a decline in poverty might be out of
*  touch with the lived experience of hardship in America today. We can also dig into those measures
*  if you want to and look under the hood and say, well, how can they show a decline and this other
*  one doesn't? What's going on? I'm happy to go there if you want to. Well, a little bit, because one
*  thing I do want to check in on there is you can have problems that correlate but don't cause each
*  other or don't tell you as much as you want to know about each other. This is a great book,
*  Homelessness is a Housing Problem. And one of the points they make is that you have a bunch of
*  urban areas with very high rates of poverty, with very, very low rates of homelessness. So Detroit,
*  Philadelphia, you have places with quite low poverty rates, or at least relatively so. So
*  Santa Clara County, San Francisco, and they have really quite high rates of homelessness.
*  So that suggests to me that when you're looking at homelessness, which as you say has been quite
*  on the rise recently, you're dealing with a housing supply problem and a housing prices problem
*  that might be distinct from a lot of the poverty problem. The point is often made here in San
*  Francisco, where I currently live, that West Virginia, it has very high poverty. It has very
*  high rates of the things people blame for homelessness here, like drug addiction and
*  mental illness, but it doesn't have the homelessness problem. We do. So rolling those all up into one
*  set of social maladies can obscure more than it's really revealing.
*  AC Yeah, I think there's something to that, but it's not just homelessness, right? That's going up.
*  Debt has gone up, bad debt. Just the number of families reporting that they are having a
*  hard time paying their mortgage or their rent has grown amazingly, enormously since 2000.
*  So I think there's a lot of things on the horizon besides homelessness that do suggest that there
*  is quite a lot of hardship as experienced on the ground level.
*  I hear you on the political ramifications of this debate. There's this text and a subtext,
*  and a lot of folks say, well, look, if you don't believe that poverty has declined, aren't you also
*  saying that government spending doesn't work? Because government spending on anti-poverty
*  programs has actually increased over the last 40 years. So what's going on? I think that it's
*  a complicated story, but it's one we have to embrace. There's a paradox here that's
*  incredibly important. On the political liability side, there's liability on both sides, right?
*  So Reagan famously said, you know, we fought the war on poverty and poverty won. There's nothing we
*  can do to address poverty in America. And then you fast forward to the Trump administration.
*  And in 2018, the Trump Council for Economic Advisers issued this report,
*  enthusiastically embracing work requirements for some welfare programs based on this claim that
*  poverty has gone down so much, we can stop fighting it. So it's kind of like, Reagan's like,
*  we fought the war on poverty, poverty won. And Trump was like, we fought the war on poverty,
*  and we won. But they both had the same conclusion. So I think there's political landmines on both
*  sides of the thing. I think what's happening is that we're spending more to stay in the same
*  place. Because some of the fundamentals of American society, the job market, and the housing market,
*  are not doing their job, basically, to help reduce poverty in this country.
*  TITO I want to hold on that for a second,
*  because I think that's very profound. You talk a lot in the book, and we're going to talk broadly
*  about this question of exploitation. And one thing reading the book got me thinking about is,
*  to take the housing market as one example, the connection between exploitation and broken markets.
*  Now, I don't want to say that you can only exploit people in a high housing market,
*  because clearly that's not true. But the more you shift power in a market to say,
*  landlords, because maybe you have way too few housing units, the more they can discriminate,
*  the more room they have to push really, really high prices on people. And so there's this kind
*  of consistent problem, I think, for progressives, where we'll put a lot of money into something,
*  maybe it'll be housing or healthcare, whatever, but we won't open up supply of that thing. In
*  some cases, we'll even constrict supply of that thing. And like we do in San Francisco with
*  housing. And then when you do that, you can give people the money you want, you can give people
*  the section eight vouchers in San Francisco you want, you're not going to house all that many
*  people because there aren't enough houses. And so there is this way, I think, in which,
*  on the one hand, I'm very big on the view that you can solve poverty with money, you could choose
*  not to have poor people by simply doing something like a negative income tax that gave people the
*  amount of money they needed to be over the line. But if you don't open up the markets of things
*  they need, then that money is just going to get pocketed by people who can charge them more and
*  more for goods they can afford but can't get access. That's absolutely the case. And I think
*  that is a real recipe for spending more to stay in the same place. And if you look at, you know,
*  federal housing assistance, look at the budget from 2001 to 2019, federal housing assistance
*  increased by 16% in real terms. So like a deeper investment, a bigger investment.
*  So does that mean that the number of families served by that program increased by that amount?
*  No, it doesn't. In fact, it hasn't increased at all over that time. You know, that number served
*  by federal housing assistance has hovered around 4.5 million families, 4.5 million in 2001, 4.5
*  million in 2019. So why? What's going on? And it's for the reason you suggest, you know,
*  because some of our biggest affordable housing programs are relationships as markets, right?
*  We're going to give you a housing voucher, you're going to live on the private market,
*  and we're going to reduce your rent, or we're going to subsidize private development. And,
*  you know, adjusting for inflation, median rent is increased by 15% over that same time period.
*  So this is one way we can kind of like make deeper investments and kind of stay in the same
*  place. It's kind of like, if you're like a doctor, and your patient is stable, and you can kind of
*  dose that patient a little bit and bring them to health and let them leave. But if that patient
*  starts to decline, you have to dose more and more and more just to get them into this stable place.
*  And I think that's a story of what's happened to poverty in the last 50 years in our country.
*  This gets at something too that I think is kind of poisonous in the way we talk about
*  poverty policy, which is that not all government programs are equal, they're not the same, they
*  don't work even similarly. And while we were preparing for this interview with you, my team
*  talked to Luke Schaefer, who's a great poverty scholar who you draw on in some of your own work.
*  And he made this point that, so we were talking earlier about how it really matters what you're
*  looking at to see if we've made progress on poverty. And one remarkable thing
*  is we made a lot of progress on poverty during the pandemic, a point you make in your book as well.
*  And Schaefer's point was that you should think about the pre-COVID welfare state, the sort of
*  welfare state we erected over the 25 years before, and then what we did in government programs in
*  2020 and 2021 as truly distinct eras of policymaking, that it's not just all government
*  programs more or less. And in that break, we saw something pretty important about what works and
*  what doesn't. So I'm curious, because you look at the story too, how you tell the story of what
*  was different and what we did during COVID and why it worked versus what we've done before to see
*  less profound effects. I think the dose was different, the dose was different, and the level
*  of investment was so much deeper during COVID. The expanded child tax credit was a much deeper
*  investment. And then in my world, in housing affordability land, the rental housing assistance
*  that came after the eviction moratorium, that was the deepest investment the federal government has
*  made in the lives of renting families since the invention of public housing, basically.
*  The government spent $46 billion, which is basically a doubling of HUD's budget.
*  It kept evictions lowest that they've ever been on record, months and months and months and months
*  after the eviction moratorium lifted. There's this study by Thomas Blanchett, Emmanuel Saez,
*  and Gabriel Zuckman. And they estimate that after the Great Recession in 2008, families in the bottom
*  half of the income distribution had to wait 10 years, 10 years for their incomes to return to
*  pre-recession levels. And after this recession, those families waited just a year and a half.
*  It was just night and day difference between these two hard moments.
*  Matthew 1
*  One thing we did too, and the child tax credit I think was a good example of this,
*  was we made these programs easy, at times even automatic, to get. And something you talk about
*  in the book is there's this widespread narrative of government dependency that the poor are all
*  lining up at the local welfare office for a handout. And you say, you know, I wish people
*  were more dependent on these programs than they are because take-up rates are incredibly low.
*  I think this is a pretty poorly known fact about a lot of this policy work. So could you talk a bit
*  about what some of the numbers are in terms of program usage among people who in theory would
*  benefit from it and should get it, and why you think that is? Matthew 2
*  So in the pandemic, we heard so much about welfare dependency. We heard this story over and again
*  that people were staying home because we were paying them to stay home. But the evidence really
*  didn't bear that out. When states got rid of some of the extra benefits, like the extra unemployment
*  insurance, and other states didn't, the states that removed the benefits didn't suddenly see
*  their job numbers jump up. It was basically a tie between the states that kept the benefits and the
*  states that got rid of them. And if you look in the data, the much bigger problem is welfare
*  avoidance. The fact that there's families across the country that are leaving like real serious
*  money on the table with respect to aid that they do not take advantage of. And so one in five of
*  poorly paid workers who qualify for the earned income task credit, this kind of one-year bump
*  that lifts millions of folks out of poverty every year, one in five do not take it. They leave $17
*  billion on the table every year. Most elderly Americans who qualify for food stamps do not
*  sign up for them. And on and on it goes. And if you add up the money left on the table in those
*  kinds of programs and folks that pass on government health insurance and unemployment insurance and
*  supplemental security income, for example, you realize every year over $140 billion, like billion
*  worth of B, dollars is left on the table by families not getting connected to programs that
*  they need and deserve. So why? What's going on? So we used to think it was stigma. The folks were
*  too proud to apply for some of these programs. And there is something to that. If anyone has
*  ever spent a day in a welfare office where you've got to spend like half a day for a 10 minute
*  appointment, there is a degradation ritual that still is very much alive and well today.
*  But there's a lot of evidence that suggests stigma isn't really the main story. You know,
*  the take up rates for food stamps, for example, very widely across state lines. You know,
*  almost everyone in Oregon who qualifies for food stamps receives them, but in California,
*  it's only about 63%. So it's not that food stamps are more stigmatized in California than Oregon,
*  something else is going on. And the thing that's going on is we've made these programs difficult
*  to apply for. We've made it painful. We kick people off the rolls every year if they don't
*  apply right. So that's the thing that's really driving it. You know, we haven't put enough effort
*  into making these programs accessible and easy to apply for. And to me, this is outrageous,
*  because if we know how to do one thing in America, it's to market things to people
*  and to get things to those people. And I just wish we, you know, dedicated as much time and effort
*  that we do getting us to buy, you know, potato chips, you know, and car tires than we do
*  getting folks connected to these important resources. But I think there's an important
*  causal question there. So my wife, Annie Lowry, is a writer at The Atlantic, and she does a lot
*  of coverage of poverty and social policy. And she's done a lot of work, particularly on what
*  she calls the time tax, which is something we're describing here, this way in which we make it
*  incredibly hard to sign up for things to qualify for things to figure out what you're actually
*  owed or eligible for. But one of the big questions is, is that an accident? Did we simply forget how
*  to market things as you know, you're suggesting we know how to get you to buy toothpaste, in theory,
*  we should be able to get you to take free money. Or is this a policy choice, right? You and there
*  are different versions of it potentially being a policy choice. One version is we use complexity
*  because we don't want people to have things either because we don't think they deserve them,
*  or we think they should be humiliated in order to get them, or we think that it will be better to
*  keep the budget low by keeping them from it. Or sometimes you see, I think in in blue states,
*  worries about fraud and defensibility. So you put a lot of energy into fraud testing and means
*  testing because you're worried about getting attacked on the right. But however you slice that,
*  there's this I think pretty profound question is about whether or not this is a policy mistake,
*  or in the terms of the people who created it this way, a policy success, it's doing exactly what it
*  is intended to do. I think it's hard not to see this as intentional as by design. And when you
*  look at what happens to other welfare programs where states have a lot of leeway about how they
*  spend their money, they spend it in a lot of ways that don't have much to do with helping
*  poor folks. So if you look at welfare spending, the spending on TANF, we call it, the Temporary
*  Assistance to Needy Families, cash welfare. So states get that money through a block grant,
*  which is just a wonky way of saying, hey, states, here's some money, spend it as you wish. And man,
*  states have developed a lot of creative ways to get that money out. Maine spends welfare dollars
*  on Christian summer camps. There are states that spend it on abstinence only education,
*  marriage counseling. For every dollar budgeted in cash welfare, only 22 cents ends up in the pockets
*  of a family. I think that's by design. That's a very intentional move. Some states are just
*  not spending the money at all. Tennessee, last time I checked, was sitting on over $700 million
*  in unspent cash welfare funds. Hawaii was sitting on so much that they could give every poor kid
*  in their state $10,000. So you're right, it's not a red or a blue state issue, but it is evidence
*  of just our lack of moral urgency and commitment to connecting families with aid that eases their
*  hunger and gives them some breath. There's also a particular way that complexity and long lines
*  and time and hoops to jump through interact with poverty in a very specific way. Can you talk about
*  what gets called the bandwidth tax? So the bandwidth tax is an idea that comes from a
*  book called scarcity, which is by Sindel, Milanathon and Eldar Shafir. It's a wonderful book,
*  highly recommend it. And they do all these experiments, compile all this behavioral,
*  economic and social psychological evidence showing how poverty taxes your mind.
*  And the bandwidth tax is an idea that a lot of us have experienced ourselves. So if we've ever been
*  incredibly late for a meeting and are rushing through traffic or we've had an emergency, our
*  kid ends up in a hospital and that's the only thing we can think about. What they suggest is
*  this mirrors poverty. This is what poverty is like when you are just thinking, how am I going to pay
*  the light bill? I just lost my job. I have the eviction notice. That just captures your mind,
*  captures your intelligence really. And that bandwidth tax can often result in bad decisions
*  that we wouldn't have made if we had a bit more space and slack in our lives.
*  I had sent to Milanathan on the show back when I was at Vox. And first, I really think this is such
*  an under-reported on issue. I mean, the way in which the thing you need to get out of poverty
*  is time and intentionality and a kind of genius. It's much harder to move up than to simply stay
*  stable and the way in which poverty saps exactly that from you. But there's a statistic here that
*  you use too, that always sticks in my mind, which is that the effect of being poor on cognitive
*  testing is roughly the same as going without a night of sleep. That the kind of distraction
*  and exhaustion of it, and we can measure this, is roughly the same as going without a night of
*  sleep. Something I noticed in myself is that the more tired I am, the more likely I am to make
*  mistakes that are small and mistakes that can be quite big. I was tired not too long ago and I
*  bashed up a rental car. It was not great. And if I was in worse shape, the cost of that would have
*  been a huge, huge, huge setback for me. You tell a story in the book that I think goes pretty far
*  in getting at this connection between poverty and exhaustion. And I'd like you to tell it,
*  but also talk a little bit about that, about that more fundamental link.
*  **Matt Stauffer** Yeah, I think you're talking about Ulio Pérez, who was a gentleman I met a few years
*  ago in the Bay Area. And he was here on a work visa from Guatemala and he was working two jobs,
*  full-time. He would work the midnight shift, night shift at McDonald's from, I think it was 10 pm to
*  6 am. And then he'd have a couple hours to shower and rest. And then he would go to a temp agency
*  called Aerotech and go anywhere they sent him from 8 am to 4 pm. And then he would get home,
*  sleep as much as he could and then back to McDonald's. Each job paid minimum wage.
*  And he just didn't have life. He was either working or sleeping. He told me,
*  I feel like a zombie. And one day his younger brother, who was eight at the time,
*  went to Ulio and is like, how much for an hour of your time? I want to buy an hour of your time so
*  you can play with me. And when he heard his brother say that, he just wept. And not long after that,
*  he collapsed from exhaustion in the grocery aisle of a supermarket. He was 24 years old.
*  And I think that looking really hard at a life like Julio's requires looking just at the sheer
*  brutality of the labor market for so many Americans today. And how he basically had to be superhuman
*  just to scrape by in the Bay Area. And I think that we should want work to be rewarded in this
*  country. But we shouldn't have to be superhuman to avoid poverty, especially in a country with
*  this much abundance.
*  This opens into the broader argument your book is making, I think, which is that if you take
*  the position that poverty is a choice, that we could with roughly, you calculate $177 billion
*  a year end it. And a lot of places you could find that money. You got to also ask then, why don't we?
*  And given that we don't, who benefits? Who benefits from poverty? And so maybe take the example
*  Julio, I mean, somebody is benefiting from that work. Somebody is doing well off of that whom?
*  So the way we like to answer this question is usually to point to the guy that's just a little
*  richer than we are, like the guy just above us. But I think that the honest answer is a lot of us,
*  a lot of us are benefiting from poverty in America. Some lives are made small, like Julio's,
*  so that others may grow. Many of us consume the cheap goods and services the working poor produce.
*  Many of us are invested in the stock market indirectly, directly. You know, don't we benefit
*  when we see our savings go up and up, even if those gains are often at the expense of someone like
*  Julio. Many of us like lavish tax breaks that we get. You know, tax breaks like the mortgage
*  interest deduction, 529 savings, employment, health insurance savings, wealth transfer savings.
*  And we protect those investments. The country does so much more to subsidize affluence than to
*  alleviate poverty. We starve anti-poverty spending because we clutch on to those benefits.
*  And then many of us continue to be segregationists. You know, we live in segregated communities. We
*  build walls around our communities in the form of laws, zoning restrictions, and we hoard affluence
*  behind those walls. And our concentration of affluence has a side effect. You know,
*  it concentrates poverty outside of our walls. So I think that for me, there's so much poverty in
*  America, not in spite of our wealth, but because of it. You know, many of us are connected to the
*  problem, which means we're connected to the solution. I was thinking about how this plays
*  out and it got me thinking about a piece I wrote back in 2021 called What the Rich Don't Want to
*  Admit About the Poor. And I think it gets at something here about how this might work beyond
*  a kind of mustache twirling. Like I love poverty and want people to suffer, which is,
*  that was a moment where you had in the pandemic, and for reasons both policy-oriented and
*  epidemiological, this very weird labor market. You had a huge amount of government support from people.
*  You had a lot of people not wanting to go to work, either because their work was dangerous or because
*  with enhanced unemployment benefits, it was a little bit more possible not to do a job that
*  they hated or didn't pay them very well. And one thing you saw right then was putting aside how
*  people feel about poverty or how they feel abstractly about wages, that when you begin to see the economic
*  effects of a sharp increase on worker power at the lower end of the scale, there's a lot of sensitivity
*  to those problems. So the news filled up with reports of businesses and the small business
*  owners saying, people are just lazy, they won't come take my jobs. Nobody will take a job for $10,
*  $12 an hour anymore. You get a lot of worry about inflation. And of course, inflation can be a real
*  problem, but we're very sensitive to it. I remember reading a lot about how Ubers were too expensive
*  now and lifts were too expensive now. And so it's not even that you have to ever think about poverty
*  to think about it. It's that when costs start going up, labor costs or good costs or service
*  costs for people of more means, we get really upset. And then suddenly programs might be building
*  shut off. I mean, we talked about the child tax credit, which was expanded during the pandemic,
*  but it's only expanded for roughly a year. And in part, I think due to inflation and due to a bunch
*  of these other concerns, there was never political will to extend it. And so this very powerful
*  anti-poverty program died. And I don't think people would say it died because we love poverty,
*  but there was a sense that was part of the political milieu at that point, that something's
*  going wrong in the labor market. And you didn't want to be adding a bunch more government support
*  to it at a time when prices were rising and people weren't taking jobs. And so there's this way in
*  which you never have to talk about poverty to end up talking about the conditions that keep people
*  under its boot. The loss of the child tax credit, the loss of emergency rental assistance,
*  this is so sad to me. It's so outrageous. Congress should have been terrified to take those programs
*  away, but there wasn't an outcry. There wasn't a strong rally saying, this is the new normal that we
*  want. Let's keep this. This is the America that I want. And it was so
*  crestfallen. And you're right. Part of the reason was because we fell into these well-worn trails
*  about how we talk about these things in abstract ways that really crush down on poor kids, poor
*  moms and dads today. If we just look at the inflation rhetoric, did we overheat the economy?
*  Is that the lesson from COVID? Okay, we reduce poverty, but is this the side effect that we have
*  to learn from? And so if you look at the data, wages don't seem to be the thing driving inflation.
*  What seems to be the thing driving inflation is corporate markups, corporate profits. A recent
*  study out of the Kansas City Fed estimated that profit markups account for more than half of the
*  inflation that took place in 2021. And that kind of price gouging is just not normal, actually.
*  If you look at the 40 years before COVID, labor costs were really the things that were driving
*  price increases. Labor costs accounted for about 60% of price increases and corporate profits about
*  11%. But then since 2020, that trend reversed itself, where labor costs now account for only 8%
*  of the inflationary pressure and corporate profits are accounting for about 54%.
*  So for me, the lesson isn't, okay, the next time around, let's not do so much to help the American
*  people, or we can't make these deep investments without driving inflation. And the lesson for me
*  is certainly not to clamp down on inflation. We have to ask middle and working class and poor
*  families to take the hard medicine. I think the lesson is that if we want to get a handle on this
*  problem, we have to get a handle on exploitation. So I like calls for increasing taxes on excess
*  corporate profits. The government can even take a page out of its playbook from the 1940s and
*  consider price controls. They have other tools in their toolbox, but the only thing we seem to
*  be talking about is inflationary rates. So I want to note that there's definitely a lot
*  of disagreement on whether or not corporate profits are to blame for inflation. And without
*  trying to parse it here, one thing that I think is kind of obviously true is that, let's say you
*  just believe, and I think this is broadly believed at this point, that inflation is a demand problem,
*  right? Most of the supply side kinks have come out of the economy, and at this point, you have demand
*  issues. You can address demand issues in a lot of different ways. I mean, something I've talked
*  about before is you could put down what gets called a progressive consumption tax. It isn't
*  in any way complex to make it costly for richer people to spend more. That would be a tax increase,
*  but so in a very direct way is removing the child tax credit, a huge tax increase effectively
*  on the poor and the working class and the middle class. And it's always interesting to me that
*  things like that, they never even get suggested. I mean, economists are worried, and I think they
*  are worried for legitimate reasons that you get a lot of weird effects from things like price
*  controls or corporate profit taxes. But okay, if you want to do something broad based, we know how
*  to do progressive taxation. You can slow spending among people who have more money, as opposed to
*  slowing it among people who have less money. But again, and again, and again, the things we choose
*  to do are more among the people who have less money and hit them hardest, as opposed to trying
*  to concentrate the pain more. One of the things I always think is telling is that there's always
*  this question of what kind of problem a society will and will not live with. What kinds of problems
*  are you willing to allow to persist? And something I definitely see, and I think it's reasonable to
*  be worried about inflation, but something I definitely see is we are not willing to have
*  high prices. We are willing to have high poverty. And I don't think those two things are a direct
*  trade off, but there is just the alarm with which people not wanting to take low wage crappy jobs
*  treated versus how accustomed the system is to poverty and is willing to live with it year after
*  year, including child poverty. It's really telling. I mean, the rubber hits the road on what you worry
*  about when it happens or when it's ongoing. And we don't like prices racing for everybody. We're
*  much more willing to take deprivation among some. That's right. And there's a part of me that feels,
*  is this just who we are? Are we stuck with us? And there's a part of me that feels there is a shift
*  going on in the American public where many of us don't want this deal anymore. The recent polling
*  on why poverty exists in America, I think is very encouraging. It suggests that most Democrats and
*  most Republicans now see poverty as a result of a structural problem, not a personal moral failing.
*  And it's like that old Gramsci line where the old is dying, but the new hasn't been born yet. And I
*  think that one of the costs we pay though, for all this poverty in our midst is emotional. It feels
*  icky. All this poverty and this profiting from other folks' pain diminishes all of us. And I
*  do sense that we as a country want to move to a different place. But part of that work just means
*  recognizing how deeply implicated we are in this problem and stop kicking the can down the road
*  and saying, well, poverty is the result of structural forces that no one is responsible for.
*  It's Congress's fault. It's the super-rich's fault, or even truly it's the poor's fault.
*  But then you get to this question of why the child tax credit wasn't sustained. So you talk to the
*  Biden administration about this, and now they realize they misjudged. But what they thought
*  would happen is if you put this giant tax credit that, by the way, was a pretty universalist
*  program. It didn't go to everybody, but it went to a lot of people. I mean, you call in the book for
*  programs that are designed to yoke people together as opposed to increasing resentment
*  between classes. And they did design it that way. And they thought, no way is Congress going to let
*  this kind of broad-based credit expire because people are going to be too pissed.
*  It would be a disaster in the midterms if they did that. And they did. And the things we saw were,
*  one, the child tax credit wasn't that popular. I mean, when you pulled it, it was not one of
*  the most popular parts of their agenda. And two, there weren't people out in the streets on it.
*  There wasn't an effective mobilization on it. So not even from the people who needed it the most.
*  Why? What needs to be learned from that? What do you make of it?
*  BD I draw two lessons, I think. First is the kind of spiritual poverty among progressives,
*  I think. I quote the theologian Walter Brueggemann in my book. And he says,
*  liberals are really fluent in the language of critique and bumbling in the language of
*  repair or celebration. When I read that, I thought, man, he's on to something there.
*  I think that there is kind of a chic nihilism or a criticality that many progressives or liberals,
*  just in general, are much more comfortable with than saying, you know, this thing, this is working.
*  This is something we should celebrate. This is something that we should be out on the streets
*  for, you know, with the emergency rental assistance. You remember how frustrating it was when that
*  program was getting off the ground, right? And there were all these distribution channels that
*  had to be created from scratch. And when they were going on, when that program was having trouble,
*  everyone was talking about it. Everyone was tweeting about it. Major news stories were writing about
*  it. And for good reason. But once that program started working, and once eviction rates started
*  plummeting, we were quiet. We were pretty quiet. And I think that there is something that we need
*  to be reflexive about just in general on the progressive side of America about that. And the
*  second take home I feel is the poverty movement has to grow. There is an active, nimble, exciting
*  anti-poverty movement that's on the ground today. You can find it in the labor movement, the new
*  housing movement, poor people's campaign. But that tent has to get a lot bigger for it to have enough
*  political power to say to Congress, no, no, no, you are not going to take away this benefit that is
*  completely transformative to so many kids around the country.
*  But I want to push you on this because why wasn't it enough then? Your book is very much about
*  exploitation. And it's very much about the ways in which the rich take advantage of the poor,
*  people lack power, they lack power to do anything. But this was a case where, you know, there weren't
*  huge protests, there was more that could have been done. And it was I know people who worked on
*  trying to mobilize here and it wasn't that easy. The great long standing conservative fear about
*  democracy is that the obvious thing that will happen is that the have nots who are numerous
*  will unite against the haves, which depending on how you define are smaller, right? You can see this
*  in, you know, in a modern form, even in Mitt Romney's 47% comments. But it goes all the way back,
*  right? It's all there with the founders, right? The people are going to band together and vote
*  to give themselves what everybody else has. And it doesn't happen anywhere near the degree to which
*  clean theory I think would predict. In fact, oftentimes the opposite happens. So why? Like,
*  what do the people who fear democracy's tendency to devolve into populism, what do they miss about
*  what makes that kind of populism so difficult to sustain? That's a deep question. I think one
*  challenge that we have in America has to do with how stigmatized poverty is. You know, there's no
*  flag for poor rights. There's no identity politics really around ending poverty. There's no button,
*  there's no sticker, there's no sign you can put in your lawn. And the stigmatization of poverty
*  really forces movements often to organize around families, around tenants, around workers,
*  but not around ending poverty. That poses a real political vulnerability where we haven't developed
*  the language yet in this country around ending poverty, including from the Democratic Party,
*  who are much more comfortable in the language of the middle class than in the language of really
*  addressing the problem of poverty. But as Michael Tubbs, the former mayor of Stockton, once put it
*  to me, like, you can't solve a problem that we don't name. And I just don't think we're naming
*  this problem as much and owning it and embracing it as a country to give it the political power it
*  needs and deserves. So one of the calls in the book is for all of us, no matter our station in
*  life, to become poverty abolitionists, to commit ourselves to ending poverty in this country once
*  and for all. How do you think about the relationship here between work and poverty? You mentioned a
*  minute ago the Democratic Party is more comfortable with the idea of the middle class. I think that's
*  true. But when you're talking about poverty, what they're really comfortable with is the idea of the
*  working class. And what they have found, I mean, the reason they talk like this is it does pull
*  better. It pulls better to means test programs. Work requirements are oftentimes pretty popular.
*  We were talking about poverty data earlier. And one theory some people have of why you see
*  some measures of deprivation, like people with no cash income going up, even as I think some of the
*  stronger poverty measures do suggest we've made some progress, is because the way we make progress
*  has been focusing more of our attention on this more sympathetic working poor. I remember that
*  Bernie Sanders used to have a banner that would show up on his campaign website. This is something
*  like, you know, nobody should work 40 hours a week and be poor in this country. And so then,
*  you know, we'll pass policies that are pretty good if you're working 40 hours a week.
*  But if you're not, and a lot of the poor either can't or for some reason don't, or they're elderly
*  or they're children, very hard for children to work 40 hours a week, you can get into issues
*  with extreme poverty that require very different kinds of solutions we're not that comfortable
*  with. So how do you think a bit about this question of our approach to poverty as a spur to work,
*  and our frustration at people we think should be working who aren't?
*  So on the one hand, the welfare state in America has really shifted to being in a welfare state
*  that does a lot more to support workers than to support folks that aren't working for whatever
*  reason. So the work by Robert Moffat, an economist at Johns Hopkins, has shown this really incredible
*  upward shift where much more money and government spending is going to families
*  right around the poverty level, and much less is going to families in this deep poverty situation.
*  And so I do think that we have designed a welfare state to supplement and encourage work. But we
*  haven't done this other thing, which is to give workers power, to make sure worker wages are
*  increasing, and to give them a seat at the table. And this I think is key. So the way that we've
*  subsidized work in this country is mainly through a program called the Earned Income Tax Credit.
*  It's a benefit for workers that are poorly paid, often families, and it's a big program. It's about
*  $61 billion a year. It helps a lot. It lifts a lot of folks out of poverty. But it doesn't confront
*  the underlying issue, the fact that so many worker wages today are low and they're falling. And this
*  is really key. This is an answer to the puzzle of how we could spend more and stay in the same place.
*  When the Great Society and the War on Poverty were launched in the 1960s, wages were climbing.
*  Unions were strong. But as unions lost power, wages started to fall. American jobs got a lot
*  worse. And for non-college educated men, real wages today are lower now than they were
*  50 years ago. So I would like to see us address not just the symptoms, but treat the disease.
*  Really go after exploitation in the labor market, which means not only subsidies like the EITC,
*  which kind of help now, short-term subsidies, but also getting deeper, making sure workers have
*  power, improving collective bargaining strategies, these kinds of things. So we can make sure wages
*  increase as spending increases. And that's the way to really bring folks out of poverty.
*  In that section of the book, you bring up one of my favorite policy ideas, which is for particularly
*  for labor, which is sectoral bargaining. You talk a bit about how we've fractured workplaces. You
*  have all these contractors. It's much harder to organize things like gig workers. But there are
*  other countries that do bargaining very differently than we do. So can you talk a bit about the way the
*  economy has changed in ways that disadvantage unions and advantage exploitation or make
*  exploitation easier? And then can you talk about what sectoral bargaining is, where it's used,
*  how it works, and what we've seen from it? Sure. So it's incredibly hard to organize
*  a workplace these days. Not only have unions lost their traditional labor base, because we've moved
*  from an industrial to a post-industrial economy, but unions also shot themselves in the foot when
*  they were at their full power. Many unions were a white man's refuge, and they completely blocked
*  black and Latinx workers from their ranks. Self-defeating racism really helped contribute
*  to the weakening of union power. And then they were attacked. There was just massive political
*  adversaries against unions that drove worker power down. So today, if you want to organize
*  a Starbucks, you've got to organize that Starbucks. And it's incredibly hard. The National Labor Board
*  shows that in about 40% of cases, corporations actually violate union rules saying we're close
*  up shop if you vote yes, or firing people that try to organize. And even if you're successful,
*  right? You organize that Starbucks. There's thousands of other Starbucks that you've got to go around and
*  organize. And so the idea of secretarial bargaining is it says, look, let's not go shop to shop. Let's
*  organize entire economic sectors instead. And this has been successful in Europe, especially. And this
*  is how it works. If enough workers in a certain sector, like food and hospitality, voted for the
*  measure, it would activate the secretary of labor. The secretary of labor would organize a collective
*  bargaining panel made up of worker representatives and corporate representatives, and they would
*  negotiate terms. And the end result of that would be a collective bargaining agreement that would
*  cover the entire sector, all the food and hospitality workers in the country. And this is a way to
*  organize all those Starbucks in one go. I should say this isn't an idea without controversy,
*  including from some unions. Some unions think like, wait a minute, is that going to wipe out
*  gains that we've made on the ground? And I think those concerns are valid. But I do think the
*  larger concern is that most workers in the private sector want a union and aren't in one. And so this
*  is one way to kind of speed up that process. There's also this view looking at places like Germany
*  where people feel this kind of policy leads to more cooperative, less antagonistic relationships
*  between labor and business, because when you're dealing with the entire sector, there's a little
*  bit more alignment of interest. And it gets to something I think that you're describing a bit
*  throughout the book, which is that if you could end some of the ways that people benefit from
*  poverty, that they benefit from worker weakness, you'd have a lot of knock on benefits. Some of
*  them are spiritual about what it's like to be in a place. I think that some of the very weird
*  reactionary politics of San Francisco have, in addition to doing with real problems we have here,
*  have to do with very rich people seeing very poor people and feeling very uncomfortable about it
*  constantly. I'm not just talking about homelessness here. I think that there's a kind of political
*  sickness that emerges in places this unequal because people know something is unstable in it.
*  But also you have a lot less antagonism. You have reasons people can cooperate as opposed to their
*  interests being so misaligned. You talk about ending poverty as a way of making people in
*  poverty and out of poverty free. Tell me a bit about that idea of freedom and the related ideas
*  of community that you develop. Well, for folks below the poverty line, for folks scraping and
*  cutting coupons and struggling, the end of poverty is a whole new life. It's breath,
*  it's freedom, it's a chance to realize your dreams. I'm really bowled over by this Rosh Chetty study
*  that just shows how many inventors poverty kind of steals from us. And it's just true just how
*  many diplomats and nurses and scientists as poverty denied us. So for folks that are below the line,
*  folks in poverty, it's just another life. But for all of us, I think the end of poverty
*  brings a better nation. I think it brings a safer nation. I think it brings a happier nation,
*  a freer nation. It brings a nation where we don't feel this complicity and connection to
*  all this deprivation around us. San Francisco is kind of a microcosm for this larger problem of
*  private opulence amongst public poverty, right? Where we let the public sector diminish even as
*  sometimes our personal fortunes grow. And that actually pulls us all down in a way. So I do think
*  a nation without poverty is something that will require some sacrifice for those of us. But I
*  think that what we're going to get in the end is something much better, more enticing. My wife sent
*  me this quote, and I'm going to butcher it, but it's something like, if you want folks to build a
*  ship, you don't assemble a team on the shore and you don't gather the wood, you make them long for
*  the end of the sea. And I think that something that I'm trying to do in the book is to convince
*  all of us that this is a country that I think we'd be happier in. I want to talk through a couple
*  of the other ideas and the big one that I wouldn't say you fully develop as a policy, but as a thought
*  experiment. You write, in 2020, the gap separating everyone in America below the poverty line and the
*  poverty line itself amounted to $177 billion. And you say that's a little bit of a rough calculation.
*  It's also a lot of money, but it's also not that much money. And you could get it from a lot of
*  different places. So before we talk about the where you could get it question, I want to talk
*  about the what would you do with it question. One reason I don't like using the official poverty
*  measure is if you got $200 billion a year and you send it out in checks, my understanding of the way
*  the poverty measure is calculated is it wouldn't change poverty at all. But in theory, it really
*  would. And you could do it. Is that what you're suggesting? We should basically have what gets
*  called some kind of a basic income or a negative income tax. We should just give people the money
*  so they're no longer poor. I think that's an amazing first step. Like if you were to ask me
*  if there was a single thing we can do, just one thing you could do that Congress could implement
*  today, I would suggest this kind of investment, this kind of guaranteed basic investment
*  in families in America. I think we could reinstate the child tax credit that did so much to reduce
*  child poverty in COVID. And I think we could also invest in stable affordable housing. I think those
*  are my two kind of big issues that I would use that money for. Tell me a bit about the stable
*  affordable housing. Something that you discuss in the book that I think will be a bit of a surprise
*  is you make an argument for much more public housing. And the reputation of public housing
*  is pretty bad. And I think it's widely considered an example of what government has tried to do and
*  cannot do. And you suggest maybe that has changed over the years. Tell me a bit about
*  the more modern versions of that policy. So most families that qualify for any kind of
*  affordable housing program don't get it. Only about one in four families who qualify
*  get it. So like I've got two young kids. If I applied for public housing today, like in
*  Washington, DC, I would be a grandfather probably by the time my application came out for review.
*  That's kind of our state. That's our state of investment in affordable housing. And that
*  means that most poor renting families today live unassisted in the private market and give at least
*  half of their income to their landlord and utility company. That's the state of America today.
*  So how should we change that? How should we address this? And one thing that I think we can do is build
*  out our public housing infrastructure to build permanent, stable, affordable housing.
*  And you're right. Public housing has such a stigma and kind of a bad rap, if you will. And it's
*  because the way we did public housing, building these giant Soviet-style complexes in Chicago and
*  Atlanta and St. Louis in an incredible segregated way, was not only cruel, we did that and then we
*  defunded it. Reagan cut HUD's budget by 70% almost, seven zero percent. And pretty soon,
*  those buildings fell into complete disrepair. The elevators stopped working, trash couldn't get
*  picked up. And then it got so bad, we dynamited them on public television. And that sounded like
*  a kindness. But we've learned from our sins, I think. And if you look at the modern public housing
*  that are in cities all over the country today, this is not your father's public housing. This
*  is public housing that blends into the community, that looks pretty, that is not segregated. And
*  often you'll drive by and not even notice that it's public housing. And I think building out that
*  infrastructure is one way to develop an approach to housing exploitation, to basically give low
*  income families more choice about where they live so they don't have to accept this one bad option
*  because it's the only option available. So somebody might hear this and say, yeah,
*  $177 billion a year, more on top of that for child tax credits and public housing and the
*  rest of the agenda. We don't have that kind of money. Money is scarce. There are a lot of needs.
*  We don't live in this world where everybody gets a pony. You don't have a lot of patience for that
*  in the book. Tell me why. A study published a few years ago showed that if the top 1% of Americans
*  just paid the taxes they owed, just stopped evading taxes, not got taxed at a higher rate,
*  that we as a country could raise an additional $175 billion a year for the public purse.
*  So we could just about fill the poverty gap if the top 1% of us paid what they owed. And that's
*  just one step in that direction. And so for me, it drives me crazy when our elected officials look at
*  the price tag of a policy idea that would cut child poverty or ensure that everybody in the country
*  affords a doctor. And they look at the bottom of the policy and they say, boy, how can we afford
*  it? How can we afford it? For me, that question is so dishonest really, and even sinful.
*  We could afford it if the richest among us took less from the government. We could afford it
*  if we funded the IRS to do their jobs. We could afford it if we did so much more to fight poverty
*  than to guard our fortunes. You're right that the fundamental lesson that emerges from this
*  debate is if we want to abolish poverty, we need to embrace policies that foster goodwill and be
*  suspicious of those that kindle resentment. And that's a big sentence, I think, in this,
*  because when you think about that $177 billion, for instance, and you think about telling somebody
*  making $75,000 a year outside of Austin with three kids, that they're not going to get anything.
*  They're not poor. But their cousin, and you do often hear this if you do poverty reporting,
*  their cousin who's a layabout and hasn't worked as hard as them and hasn't made the good choices
*  they've made, he's all of a sudden, or she's all of a sudden going to get this check that somehow
*  or another is maybe on this person's back or at least could have gone to them and things they need.
*  And that pisses them off. So then you get into things like universal basic income,
*  that's much more expensive, then the math does get harder. But so tell me a bit about that question
*  of how you do this without kindling resentment. I really like this idea of what might be called
*  bigger tent targeting. It's kind of like a sweet spot between targeted programs like food stamps,
*  which are cost efficient. But you're right, you know, if you make $1 over the limit,
*  you're cut out. And it's a sweet spot between targeted programs like that and universal
*  programs. They reach everyone but are very expensive sometimes. And a bigger tent targeting
*  kind of recognizes that the poverty line is too low, that there are quite a lot of Americans,
*  like that family making $75K in Austin, who are struggling too. And so how to kind of expand
*  these programs, not only to reach families that are desperate for them at the bottom,
*  but also families that belong to the working class and even middle income families. And the
*  child tax credit and COVID, I think was a good example of this. It was a big program. And it
*  reached a lot of folks. And I don't think it was a divisive program because of that. So I think to
*  do this, though, we really have to reject the scarcity mindset. This idea that the country is
*  a country of scarce resources, and we really have to ration. And I would have a lot more patience
*  for that kind of argument if we did a much better job collecting taxes from the top 20%. And if our
*  welfare state wasn't so imbalanced, where we had so many tax breaks accruing to families that have
*  plenty already. So I think we have to push against scarcity. And we have to design these programs
*  that are bigger tent. Something you're pretty straightforward about in the book is that the
*  idea that everything benefits everybody is wrong. You talked about this in terms of rhetoric from
*  Biden and others that there's this tendency to try to make everything into a positive sum
*  action. And that if this stuff were so great for the rich, they would already do it.
*  But that goes on down the income ladders, too. And you talk about the way people show up at
*  neighborhood meetings to try to keep affordable housing from being built in their neighborhood.
*  And that's not only really rich people. And you talk a bit about how there are a huge number of
*  these tax breaks all throughout the system. The mortgage interest deduction and the 529 program and
*  on and on and on and on that middle class people like, upper middle class people like. And these
*  aren't people you think of as really rich, but there's a lot of money in them. And any attempt
*  to touch those sets off a political firestorm. So I'd be curious to hear you talk a bit about
*  this question of, if not sacrifice, and at least the question of loss and change. And not just in
*  terms of taxation, but in terms of who's in our communities, who has what kind of political power,
*  what maybe we can pay or get cheaply, right? You know, going back to this question of cheap
*  goods and cheap Uber rides and, you know, cheap stuff imported from China. How do you think about
*  this question of having sacrifice without resentment? I think this is really where this call for poverty
*  abolitionism comes in. You know, this is a political project, but it's a personal one too.
*  It's me committing to this belief that poverty is an abomination and committing to this kind of
*  commitment to unwind myself from poverty in my everyday life. And so that does mean viewing
*  things like tax breaks or zoning laws. It's not just like abstract principles that are out there,
*  but things that I can actively try to shift the common sense on. So tax season's upon us.
*  And so what if instead of like complaining about taxes, which is something that everyone does,
*  left, right, and center. What if the next time, you know, someone in your office or over your
*  fence line says, oh my God, this taxes, you know, you say, look, in 2020, we spent $190 billion on
*  homeowner tax subsidies and only $53 billion on direct housing assistance to the needy.
*  And I feel that's kind of crazy because like most of that benefit, those homeowner tax subsidies
*  went to families with six figure incomes, you know. That just seems wrong when we have an
*  eviction crisis. So, and I get that thing. I get the mortgage introduction. That's crazy.
*  I think I'm going to write my congressperson and wind it down. And what if we did that,
*  you know, by the hundreds and by the thousands and by the tens of thousands. I think that's a way to
*  shift the kind of aperture and the conversation about what's considered normal. And I do think
*  that will take some sacrifice, but I do think the end product ultimately is a country that
*  is something that we all want to see come about. A country that actually puts the money where its
*  mouth is when it comes to expanding economic opportunity and with segregation and zoning.
*  This is also very personal. You're right. You know, the folks that are going down
*  on a Tuesday night in the zoning board meetings and yelling at the Alderan and
*  gumming up the process and forming petitions and suing cities, they're active. They're active
*  defenders of the law. And I think those of us that are seeking a more open, inclusive community,
*  we've got to put in that work too, right? We've got to go down to that Tuesday night zoning
*  board meeting and stand up and be like, look, I refuse to deny other kids benefits my kids have
*  had living here. Let's build this thing. And that's going to be awkward and that's going to
*  be challenging. But I think that's what this requires. And all of us have a role to play in
*  this, I think, whether we come from abundance or we're struggling today. There's a connection
*  you're drawing at the end of the book that is clearly there and is also a little fuzzy. And I
*  want to get you to try to explain more of what you're saying here, because you talk about this
*  question of poverty and community. And you write about your family moving from a place in Wisconsin
*  to East Darlington, a suburb of Boston, and noticing that this new community you're living
*  in, which is richer, houses are bigger, that something is also missing. You talk about far
*  fewer issues and far less joy in your new community. You talk about the snow falling
*  and neighbors clearing only their own walks, not each other's. And I think there's one way to read
*  this, which is a bit of a cliche. There's not much money down there, but everybody's together.
*  But I take you as saying something about a connection between the sort of values and
*  almost spiritual way of being in the world that comes from trying to protect what is yours
*  and what's possible when you open up. That there's some kind of ineffable community
*  that is possible from equality, that is impossible amidst inequality.
*  And I was hoping before we wrap up that you could talk about what you're saying there,
*  what you're predicting there, what you're suggesting about this possible world we could
*  live in and gain that isn't monetary in value, but that even the rich don't necessarily know
*  what they're missing. Yeah. I think that there is a spiritual poverty that's gripping a lot of
*  communities in America. And look, I've lived in some very poor neighborhoods and I'm not romantic
*  about that. But I haven't experienced the kind of generosity and just like sheer neighborliness
*  that I did in those neighborhoods, in effluent neighborhoods that I've lived in.
*  And I'm thinking about that group in Minneapolis that we talked about earlier.
*  And I remember speaking to a woman named Chloe Jackson, who when she started getting involved in
*  that tenants rights movement, she was working at a store at the airport making $15.69 an hour.
*  She wasn't politicized. She was just a single mom just trying to make it.
*  And she more and more got involved in the movement. And the movement meant going to
*  eviction court when one person did, everyone would show up, bring tamales, bring pizza.
*  And she told me like, look, before we were just neighbors, but now we're a family.
*  And I think there's something to that. I think there's some spiritual violence we do to our lives
*  when we live apart from each other, when we're segregated from each other.
*  And when we kind of clutch on to money as our only security in America, that we have the kind of
*  like a stingy, frightened affluence, I think, today. So I do think that there is, you know,
*  this is a part of the book that's fuzzy because I feel challenged, you know, writing about things,
*  you know, beyond the data in a way. It just, it really pushes me. It gets me out of my comfort
*  zone. But at least in my experience, you know, there's real happiness, there's real joy in
*  binding your lives to folks that are quite different from you. Yeah. And I wanted to try
*  to get that across in the book a little bit. I think that's a good place to end. So always
*  our final question. What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  I recommend What Then Must We Do by Leo Tolstoy. He wrote it in 1886. It's a weird book, but
*  I kind of love it because the great writer is really wrestling with the same question this
*  book is wrestling with. Why is there so much poverty around me? And you see him go through
*  the motions. Does it work? No, the poor are working all the time. What is it? What is it?
*  And he finally ends on this answer that I kind of end on, you know, it's me, you know, he says,
*  Tolstoy says. And so he kind of cuts through the abstractions and the excuses. And I think there's
*  just a beautiful spiritual clarity about that book. I really loved Race for Profit by Kianga
*  Yamada Taylor. This is a historical work and it's looking at what happens when we kind of do policy
*  halfway, you know, and it looks at the how the real estate business incorporated and marketed
*  itself to black families after 1968 and shows how this government program led to all this
*  exploitation and all these foreclosures for these families. And she comes up with this powerful
*  phrase about predatory inclusion, which I think is very applicable to so many other policy realms
*  today. And my third book is Random Family, the classic investigative journalism by Adrienne
*  Nicole LeBlanc. She spent over 10 years living and working and reporting alongside poor families in
*  the South Bronx. We see kids grow up. This is a book where I remember exactly where I was
*  when I read it. I was in a garage in Minnesota and how beautifully she wrote about people in their
*  full complexity that were experiencing hardship running from the law and how gracefully she shows
*  folks not reduced to their hardships. Matt Desmond, thank you very much.
