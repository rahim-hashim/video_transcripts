# Why Silicon Valley Bank Collapsed â€” And What Comes Next
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [March 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzfGFzsy_UQ)
*  I'm Ezra Klein. This is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  So I'm not telling you anything you don't know here. On Friday, Silicon Valley Bank
*  failed. Now, bank failure, not necessarily the biggest deal in the world. You know that 18 banks
*  failed in 2014? Honestly, I didn't until I looked it up. Or that 8 failed in 2017. But most of those
*  banks were pretty small. Bank failures, they matter when the banks are really big, or they're really
*  connected to other parts of the financial system. So what was Silicon Valley Bank? It's weird. It
*  was in the middle. It was about $200 billion in assets. It was the 16th biggest bank in the country.
*  I'd say it was not the kind of bank on its own that we would usually worry about.
*  But it was a weird bank, it turned out. I mean, it was the bank of Silicon Valley, for one thing.
*  And so it was absolutely central to the startup ecosystem out here. Nearly half of venture finance
*  bank companies had money in there. Nearly half. And some of them had a lot of money just sitting
*  there. Roblox, the online game company, they had $150 million just sitting in the bank.
*  And having a bunch of customers with really big accounts in your bank, that actually changes
*  the situation. Because one reason bank failures often aren't a big deal or don't happen at all
*  is that most accounts are FDIC insured. The FDIC will pay every depositor back up to $250,000.
*  And that is usually enough to stop a bank run from even happening. Why run to the bank
*  and try to get your money back if the government will just give it to you anyway if anything
*  happens. So the average bank, about half of all accounts are FDIC insured. At Silicon Valley Bank,
*  and I've seen some different numbers here, it seems only a single digit percentage of the accounts
*  were under $250,000. Only a single digit percentage. And these accounts, they were
*  concentrated in the same industry, Silicon Valley. An industry getting battered by higher interest
*  rates, where you're seeing huge layoffs, where you're seeing a kind of change in its own
*  understanding of itself. And so suddenly, these startups, they need their money. And they're very
*  worried about anything happening to their money. And Silicon Valley Bank, on the other side of its
*  ledger, it held tons of bonds. They had taken all that money the startups gave them and put it into
*  things that looked pretty safe, like treasuries. But those were a different investment at a time
*  of really low interest rates. So as interest rates began rising over the past year, they got
*  battered. And these bonds, if they wanted to sell them, were worth less. So we get a bank run on
*  Silicon Valley Bank. And then the thing about bank runs is their psychological phenomena,
*  their narratives are not just economic events. And they can spread and they can destroy healthy
*  banks too, because banks do not keep enough money on hand to give everyone their money all at once.
*  And then you get this other issue. The thing about the people who banked at Silicon Valley Bank is
*  they're very well known, they're very powerful, and they have a lot of control over the narrative.
*  They have big Twitter followings, they get invited on CNBC, they can write op-eds in the major papers.
*  They're people you've heard of, they're people who can convince other people of things. And they used
*  that narrative power to shout as loudly as they could, that if their bank failed, it would create
*  a nationwide bank run, it would create contagion. And the thing about that, it's not clear that's
*  true. Just normally, Silicon Valley Bank had failed. Not even clear it would have failed if
*  the venture capital class hadn't created their own bank run on it. But even if it did fail,
*  it's not clear it would have infected other banks normally. But if they convinced people it would,
*  then it would, because all you need for a bank run is for people to believe in a bank run.
*  And so that could have been self-fulfilling. And so the federal government stepped in hard.
*  They didn't just back all the deposits at Silicon Valley Bank of any level that were held there,
*  although the Silicon Valley Bank itself no longer exists. But they implicitly did that for every
*  bank that might fall into trouble anywhere in the country. And so we might have just changed the
*  banking system quite a bit. And then there's this other issue here. I mean, there are a lot of issues
*  here, but we are in this period where interest rates are going up. And we are seeing, as has been
*  argued before, including by guests on the show, that the financial system has really oriented
*  itself around a period of very, very, very low interest rates. Its investments are oriented
*  around that. Its risk management is oriented around that. Its intuitions are oriented around
*  that. And as that changes, things are going to break. They are already breaking, this being one
*  example. And so there's a lot to learn and unpack here. Noah Smith is an economist. He's the author
*  of the great sub stack, No Opinion. And he's done some of the clearest writing and coverage of this
*  mess. So we get into it here. As always, my email is roclineshow at nythimes.com.
*  Noah Smith, welcome to the show. Hey, thanks for having me on. So I want to begin in how Silicon
*  Valley Bank ends up in so much trouble. So you got this bank, it has a commanding position among
*  startups. It serves half of all venture backed companies in the US, pretty big. Startups are
*  flush with cash. They're pumping money into the bank. Deposits grow from 61 billion at the end of
*  2019 to 189 billion at the end of 2021. It's amazing. And the bank doesn't do something crazy
*  with the money. They put the money largely into treasury bonds, super safe and some other very
*  safe bond classes. So how do they then end up in this crisis? Well, a couple things. Number one is
*  if you put your money in long dated fixed rate treasury bonds, like your average, you know,
*  10 year or whatever treasury bond, you took a big loss when interest rates went up because
*  the cardinal rule of bonds, for those who don't know, is that when interest rates go up,
*  bond prices go down. You know, if I have a bond that pays 2% interest forever and then interest
*  rates go up to 5% at the national level, my bond's worth less because it's just worth less compared
*  to everything else people can get. And so all these portfolios of bonds that Silicon Valley Bank and
*  other banks are holding onto lost value very quickly. So I think this is not always super
*  intuitive. So the bond will still pay you what the bond promises to pay you. But if you need
*  to sell the bond to get as much money from it as you can immediately, somebody else won't buy it
*  for as much as you want them to buy it for. That's the issue. That's exactly right. It's a 10 year
*  bond, meaning to get all your money out as promised, you'd have to hold onto it for 10 years.
*  If you have to sell it tomorrow, you will get a lot less money than if you hold it for the whole
*  10 years. So this is these long dated bonds are risky in the sense that if you need to sell it
*  tomorrow to raise cash, you're going to have to sell it at a loss. I'm sure the people at Silicon
*  Valley Bank are having a really bad week. But this seems like a pretty elementary error. It's almost
*  like the risk management strategy here was vibes. Like the vibe of treasuries is that they're really
*  safe. But the thing, as you say, people know about bonds is you're supposed to do something
*  to hedge against interest rate risk. You can actually buy hedges, you can do all kinds of
*  things with maturities. They seem to have had a portfolio that vibed as super safe in this era
*  when interest rates are really low. And they didn't do pretty basic things to protect themselves
*  against interest rates going up. Is that me being unfair to them? I think it is being unfair,
*  actually. Okay, I think they were actually, you know, fine with that. What would have been risky
*  is if they had made a whole bunch of risky loans, like banks did before 2008. You can do some things
*  to mitigate that interest rate risk. But there's not a heck of a lot you can do. You can hold like
*  staggered portfolios so that some of your bonds mature next year and some the next year after
*  that, etc., etc. You can do that. You can find floating rate debt. There's a bunch of things you
*  can do to mitigate it. But not everyone can really do them at the same time. You know, it's not like
*  our whole economy can be completely insensitive to changes in interest rates, right? Like you can't
*  all buy insurance against the same thing happening. Who's going to pay the insurance out? Does that
*  make any sense? So treasuries weren't safe, but they were, you know, reasonably safe. They're not
*  toxic, weird stuff that you won't be able to value in a crisis. They're easy to value. You won't have
*  a big price impact from dumping them on the market. They're not bad. And interest rates had gone only
*  one way for 40 years. And when it looked like a one-way bet and everyone who bet against that
*  always got crushed and crushed and crushed for decades and decades. And so to continue making
*  that bet didn't seem weird. It didn't seem unsafe. And one day that bet went wrong when inflation
*  came back and the Fed had to start raising rates. So I had the economic historian, Adam Twoes,
*  on the podcast back at the end of 2022. And I think it's actually a show worth going back to
*  because the main argument he's making there is that as the central banks all across the world,
*  but particularly in the U S began raising interest rates to try and fight inflation,
*  that things in the financial system are going to start breaking. That we had seen a crisis in the
*  UK. We were going to start seeing more and we didn't know where they would be, but the financial
*  system had become, as you're saying here, used to very low interest rates for a very long time.
*  And it built itself around that assumption and started acting as if that bet would be the same
*  bet forever. And that when the Fed began to reverse course, things would go weird in places
*  we weren't seeing. So do you think what we're seeing with Silicon Valley Bank is an example
*  of his thesis coming true? Of course. Yes. And things are going to break where they're most
*  fragile. The reason Silicon Valley Bank was fragile wasn't that it had more treasuries than
*  other banks. It did not. It had a fairly normal portfolio there. But the thing that was weird
*  about Silicon Valley Bank is the way they funded all of it was not their assets. It was their
*  liabilities. It was the money they owed to their depositors. So most banks have a higher amount of
*  FDIC insured deposits and other core deposits, which are things that are basically insured.
*  Everyone knows they can get their money out even if there's a run on the bank.
*  So that's why there isn't a run on the bank for most banks at most times. We occasionally do have
*  bank runs. Silicon Valley Bank, most of its customers were in one industry. And most of
*  those customers had a lot of cash that they needed to stash somewhere. So if you're a startup,
*  you're not paying your payroll and your rent out of your revenues because you don't have revenues
*  yet. Or maybe you don't have much revenues. So instead, a venture capitalist hands you a
*  giant sack of cash. And where do you put that cash? Well, if you're smart, you put it in
*  treasuries or a big bank or something like that. A lot of people weren't smart and they just stashed
*  it all in the banks that their friends use in the shaky regional bank, which is Silicon Valley Bank.
*  And so we'll get to that later. But basically Silicon Valley Bank survived on these uninsured
*  deposits, these very large cash deposits from startup companies or large private companies
*  that we call startups, even though they're well past startup stage. That's where the deposits
*  came from. And there's two bad things about that. Number one, it's not insured at all. So it's very
*  easy to have a bank run because the accounts are all too big to be insured. They're over the FDIC
*  limit. And the second thing is that when you have a crash in the tech industry specifically,
*  everyone starts yanking their deposits for reasons that aren't a bank run.
*  So two other banks did get taken down here, which is Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital. You hear
*  people sometimes call them crypto banks. What happened there? These banks were serving crypto
*  related companies. So there's a lot of complex crypto stuff that shouldn't ever have come into
*  existence but did. There's stable coins. So like USDC is a stable coin that's supposed to be equal
*  to one dollar. And in order to do that, they have to hold a bunch of securities. It's basically a
*  giant money market fund that is run through crypto because crypto is cool and trendy. But it's
*  basically a giant money market fund. They hold unrisky short dated T-bills, which are like short
*  term treasuries, commercial paper, whatever. I don't even know what they hold, but it's public,
*  it's regulated. And so they do this and they label it crypto because that's cool. And they
*  have to hold those assets somewhere. So they hold them with a bank. But then crypto bank means that
*  when weird stuff happens in the crypto market, your depositors who are crypto companies are
*  going to yank their money really quick because of random crap that happened in the crypto market.
*  So they're exposed to that. And then of course, when they lend, they may also do lending to crypto
*  companies. That's the other sense in which you can be a crypto bank. You can lend to crypto
*  companies. You can take deposits from crypto companies. And so you can do all that. And that
*  means you're just heavily exposed. Like if you think that a bunch of startups yanking their money
*  because VC funding dried up, if you think that's a risk, how about crypto companies yanking their
*  money because I don't know, this week, Russia decided to stop manipulating the market as much
*  as it was last week or whatever the crazy dumb thing is happening out there in international
*  financial crypto land, which is something that shouldn't exist, but that does. That's going to
*  put pressure on your bank and make it fail. I think it's an interesting point. So you have
*  is an intense concentration of depositor risk in a way. So you have all these startups that are
*  giving you all their money when they're flush. Then, and this is, I think an interesting
*  phenomenon of the economy more broadly right now. The tech industry has been particularly hard hit.
*  It has been a very intense tech recession. I think it's fair to say, even as we've not gone into an
*  overall recession. And so they begin pulling money. And then there's this other dynamic,
*  which is it, it's not just a, an industry with an economic concentration, but a kind of
*  communication rumor, et cetera, concentration. So all these people are on Twitter,
*  VCs are all talking to each other. They're all in group chats together. And so when Peter Teal
*  says that all of his portfolio companies should pull out of the bank, that that also has this
*  quality of spreading very fast as a piece of information that then all these other similar
*  players begin doing the same thing. And so you have a bank run. Right. Exactly. So I think there's
*  a couple pieces of this here. The first piece is that tech stocks crashed starting in, I think,
*  December of, of 2021. And they crashed all throughout 2022. And then when big tech stocks
*  crash and there's a bunch of layoffs, venture capital fundraising for startups dries up.
*  And so venture capital funding, which had surged during the easy liquidity of the pandemic years,
*  really just completely crashed. So all these startups were, they call it using a runway,
*  burning through their cash, basically that they'd already raised to pay their employees
*  until hopefully the environment, fundraising environment improves, or they just die. But in
*  the meantime, they're just using up all their cash. They stashed all this cash with Silicon
*  Valley bank and now they have to withdraw it. So they start withdrawing, start withdrawing.
*  Now that doesn't immediately cause a run, right? But it forces Silicon Valley bank to sell a bunch
*  of its assets down to pay them the cash that they owe to their depositors. They need to pay.
*  Right. So when people come and say, Hey, I want my deposit back, you need to sell assets to get
*  that deposit back. And so companies were selling assets even before, or we're sorry,
*  we're demanding their deposits back even before the bank run. And Silicon Valley bank was selling
*  assets even before the bank run. And it had to sell its most liquid, easily sold assets first.
*  And it's assets that, you know, had the least losses from interest rate hikes. So its best
*  assets got sold off first just to meet these redemptions from the tech crash last year,
*  which made it more vulnerable to a run. And the second piece, as you said, is the sort of
*  herd mentality panic concentration thing where if Peter Thiel says, everybody pull your money from
*  this bank and everybody who has money in the bank is someone who listens to Peter Thiel,
*  then you're done. You're over bank run. So this was a big bank, big ish, big regional bank,
*  around 200 billion in assets, if I'm remembering correctly, 200 billion, but not the biggest,
*  we're not talking about a Wells Fargo here. Absent who it serves and the industry that was
*  concentrated in it. Would you have said Silicon Valley bank is what we would call systemically
*  important? No, definitely not. So Silicon Valley bank doesn't really have any links to the broader
*  financial system. It's not like Citibank and Wells Fargo are going to collapse because they
*  had loaned money to Silicon Valley bank or because Silicon Valley bank had loaned them money or
*  because Silicon Valley bank was going to dump assets that were going to make them insolvent in
*  a fire sale. This is all the stuff that happened in 2008. There were none of these interbank
*  linkages really between Silicon Valley bank and these other banks. And it wasn't that big.
*  The only reason that Silicon Valley bank that it collapsing could cause a more general collapse
*  was the psychological panic was this idea that once you saw a bank collapse and you saw a bunch
*  of people screaming about the bank collapsed, then everyone would say, oh my God, banks aren't safe.
*  Who knew? And you know, did you know banks could have runs? I've never seen Mary Poppins or it's a
*  wonderful life or, you know, I've who knew this could happen? And then and then just start pulling
*  their money from every possible bank like chickens with their heads cut off. And that's just a panic.
*  In fact, that's how the bank run happens in Mary Poppins. Some old guy is trying to take
*  tuppence, you know, a little bit of money from some kid and he says, give me my money.
*  Why won't you give me my money? And someone hears, oh my God, the bank won't give him his money. And
*  so everybody just charges into the bank and demands their money in the bank because that's
*  how bank runs work. And so I mean, they don't work literally like that, but that's sort of how this
*  work. You know, all the VCs were basically like the person on the street who says, oh my God,
*  the bank won't give someone their money. Let's all run to the bank right now. And like the people
*  on the streets of Edwardian England and Mary Poppins, they, you know, there's there's sort of
*  herd creatures. So this, I think is really important. So as you're saying, banking panics
*  are psychological. They can be at one bank, but they can also spread to all banks. If for some
*  reason you think that what's happening Silicon Valley Bank is going to affect your bank in
*  Illinois, but you run and take your money out of your bank in Illinois, which is fine until
*  everybody started doing that. And now it's going to collapse. The people who bank at Silicon Valley
*  Bank have just a tremendous amount of global narrative setting power. They have high Twitter
*  follower accounts. They get invited on CNBC. They can write op-eds in the financial times and the
*  New York times and so on. And they all panic. I mean, you can argue if the panic was a little
*  bit opportunistic to try to get the bank saved, or they're just really panicking, but you're getting
*  these, you know, mega VCs writing an all caps lock telling everybody to freak out, which can create
*  a self-fulfilling everybody freaks out. So is that why the federal government had to step in
*  as forcefully as it did? Not that Silicon Valley Bank was systemically important, but
*  because of who had served it ended up being so narratively important that that was the same thing.
*  I think that's exactly right. There's a couple pieces of this. So I think that's the big piece
*  that you just said. You know, I think Jason Calacanis said, I'm going to buy ammo and jugs
*  of water tomorrow and posted pictures from Mad Max. He's a big VC. Yeah, he's a VC with a big
*  Twitter account. You know, he said that after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, but then
*  that probably helped spook people into trying to pull their money out of First Republic, PAC West,
*  Western Alliance, Signature Bank, maybe. And some of these others, those were sort of the big four
*  others that were in danger. And all of the, none of these is a big bank. One or two were about the
*  same size as Silicon Valley Bank. But anyway, so that was part of it. This narratively important,
*  I think is a good phrase here. But the other part of it was that other banks have also taken losses
*  on their treasury portfolios. Like we said, not everyone can insure against interest rate risks at
*  the same time. Someone's got to hold interest rate risk. And in practice, that's going to be banks.
*  You know, banks are going to hold treasuries. And so that's why our government sells fixed rate
*  treasuries to fund itself. Who is it going to sell to? Realistically, it is going to sell to banks.
*  And so every bank in the country had taken losses on its portfolio, Citibank and Chase and all these
*  things. Now Citibank and Chase have implicit government guarantees, and they have higher
*  ratios of insured deposits. Although Citibank is actually pretty crappy on this front as well.
*  But they're much safer against this kind of thing. But when every bank at once has taken financial
*  losses, just because interest rates got raised, you could see runs in the wider world from people
*  outside tech, you know, VCs screaming on Twitter, notwithstanding.
*  So if tech has a particular reason that in that one industry to that one bank,
*  people are demanding their deposits back very quickly because they need to pay their employees
*  and so on, they're starting to get scared. That same depositor risk might not exist at, say,
*  PacWest. But if the depositors simply get scared, then it does.
*  Right. That's exactly right. And so the danger was that corporate managers, you know, people who run
*  an auto body chain of auto body shops out in Illinois, we're going to look at this and read
*  the news and say, Oh my God, I've got to pull my money out of my bank too. That the panic would
*  spread outside of tech world and outside of California. And then, you know, it wouldn't kill
*  the big banks, but it would cause a recession, it would be enough to cause a recession.
*  So let's talk actually about exactly what they did here. What did the federal government build
*  as their kind of answer to the problem? Usually when a bank fails, the FDIC will be able to find
*  another bank to just take over both its assets and its deposits. So for example, when Washington
*  Mutual, which was bigger than Silicon Valley Bank failed in 2008, it just got rolled into Chase.
*  Yesterday, you had an account at Washington Mutual. Today, you had an account at Chase.
*  And then Chase took all the assets too. And so that happened in 2008. And that's what usually
*  happens. 91% of the time, I believe that's what happens with Silicon Valley Bank. It was too large
*  to do this. So they were going to have to break up the assets and sell them and return the cash to
*  people. So the FDIC took Silicon Valley Bank into which called receivership, which basically means
*  the FDIC now just owned it. And the FDIC was going to sell off all these treasury bonds or whatever
*  that Silicon Valley Bank had and return the cash to the companies that had banked with Silicon
*  Valley Bank. That's what they were going to do. And that is a process that would take a while.
*  You can sell off maybe half of them really quick so that companies can keep making payroll,
*  but to sell off the rest will take maybe months. And during those months, none of those corporate
*  customers will know for sure whether they'll get 100% of their money back or 90% or 98% or whatever.
*  And that uncertainty could help continue to fuel bank runs elsewhere as Main Street,
*  auto body shop chain, CFO in Illinois looks at those people and says, well, it's been two months
*  and they still haven't gotten 100% of their cash back. Maybe just to be safe, I should pull my money
*  from my regional bank and move it into Chase or move it into treasuries or something. So it would
*  go on for months. And so they needed to resolve it quickly and they couldn't find a single buyer to
*  take over like they usually do. So instead, what they did was they said, okay, new insurance fund
*  to insure uninsured deposits of banks that we think are important, such as Silicon Valley Bank.
*  We're creating a new insurance fund and we're retroactively insuring all these deposits.
*  And hey, all you other healthy banks out there, you're contributing now to this insurance fund.
*  Normally you wouldn't have an insurance company that on its first day has to pay out claims.
*  You would attract policies first and then pay out on the policies later. But this time the government
*  said, okay, we're making a new insurance fund and this new insurance fund, banks will pay into it
*  later. But today the new insurance fund will just pay out the depositors of Silicon Valley Bank.
*  That's what they did. New insurance fund that was sort of retroactively insured all those depositors.
*  So
*  one thing that you made a really big point of saying in some of your pieces is that's not a bailout.
*  Why do you say it's not a bailout? Well, okay, so you can call anything you want a bailout as long
*  as it's something the government does and it makes economic outcomes better for somebody that
*  otherwise wouldn't have been. In fact, people do rhetorically call all kinds of things bailouts.
*  You could call lowering interest rates a bailout because it pumps up the value of
*  financial portfolios. You can call these things bailouts. But the reason I don't call it a bailout
*  is because it does not have two of the main characteristics that the bailouts of 2008 had
*  that made a lot of people angry. And the first characteristic was in 2008, by and large,
*  with the exception of one or two companies, by and large, the executives and managers who were
*  responsible for making the mistakes that led to the crisis got to keep their jobs and fat paychecks
*  and basically give up nothing because they were so systemically important. They stayed in their jobs.
*  They retired to really nice houses in the Hamptons or whatever. And so that was the first thing that
*  made people mad. And the second thing that made people mad was that taxpayers were on the hook
*  for a lot of money. Now, eventually, the government did make a profit on the bailouts of 2008.
*  Yeah, people, I think, don't realize that TARP ended with a $15 billion profit for the government.
*  Right. And not just TARP, but the other like AIG, the bailouts in general ended up profitable for
*  the government. But that took a long time. And that only happened because of quantitative easing.
*  So the government sort of gave itself a profit. But the point is that nobody knew in 2008 that
*  that was going to happen. And it wasn't certain that it would happen. There was no certainty that
*  they'd make a profit on that. It could have ended up like, I think, the savings and loan crisis.
*  I think the government actually lost money on that, which meant that the taxpayer was on the hook in
*  some sense. And so that could have happened in 2008. And that made a lot of people mad. Why am I
*  bailing out these people who get to keep their million dollar a year jobs? And so neither of
*  those happened here. So the Silicon Valley Bank people are out. So Silicon Valley Bank is not even
*  a thing anymore. In addition, there's no possibility of taxpayer money being on the hook here. If panic
*  spread to the rest of the banks, then they would. Then at that point, taxpayer money would have to
*  be used. But just with Silicon Valley Bank, there's not. And so in that sense, two of the main things
*  people were mad about are not here. But if you want to call it a bailout, you still can. I can't stop
*  you. There's no dictionary definition where you can say, look here, this is not technically a bailout
*  because that's a colloquial term. Yeah. I want to hold on this question for a second, though, because
*  I think I'm more on the it is a bailout side. So Joe Wiesenthal of Bloomberg, I think, has made a
*  good argument here. But I do think it gets to this point you're making, which is how do you define
*  this stuff? What is it people get mad about or don't get mad about? And I think to the extent that
*  a bailout is special treatment that specifically powerful people or powerful classes of financial
*  players get from the government because they're too important to face financial collapse.
*  I think that's one of the things that gets people angry here. So maybe use a different example.
*  You've got a lot of people, a lot of workers in Silicon Valley, who they took tech jobs,
*  and that was a responsible, normal thing to do. And then the government raised interest rates,
*  and the tech firms decided they're all too flabby and bloated and they fired a bunch of these people.
*  And now maybe they can't make their car payments or they can't make their mortgage payments.
*  And they're going to default and nobody's going to come in and say, Hey, you guys are so great and
*  so important. And this was just bad luck, you know, and we don't want this to happen to you.
*  So we're making you whole. Whereas all the people in this bank, which, you know, also, I think it's
*  fair to say, I'm not a fan of the view that depositors should have to like run the numbers
*  on whether the bank is hedging interest rate risk correctly to put in a deposit, but they get made
*  whole because it would be for various reasons, dangerous to let them not be made whole. And
*  on the one hand, I think you should do this, but I do think that the sense that financialized risk
*  gets socialized much more often than individual risk or at least certain kinds of individual risk.
*  I think there is a reality to that that does sort of generate populist anger. What's very funny to
*  me or darkly funny maybe is that a lot of these VCs who are very loud critics of all those things
*  in 2008, and this is part of why they all get into crypto, et cetera. They were lined up real quick
*  here to get the same treatment. But I do think there's something to the sense that people feel
*  that financial players, they sometimes get sweeter deals than like just somebody who would lose their
*  house would get. Right. So in this case, the people who directly got money, who got paid out,
*  were depositors at the bank. Now, there were some rich people who kept personal money in Silicon
*  Valley Bank, but almost all of it was corporate cash with the companies. And those companies have
*  employees. So this is- But that was heavily true in 2008 too. I mean, the argument that these things-
*  Those bills were good in many respects. I don't think we should have kept the management there.
*  Yes, I agree with that. And in some cases we didn't. But listen, I'm for more Old Testament
*  justice having been meted out in 2008 as Tim Geithner used to say that people wanted him to do.
*  He should have done that in my view and things might have been a little bit politically better
*  afterwards. But that's the point. I mean, I think the point I'm setting up here is that I also think
*  that one argument you're now hearing is that, look, the government has shown that that $250,000 FDIC
*  limit is bunk. They'll wipe it out if they see any risk coming from not insuring deposits above that.
*  So we should just formalize this. We should insure deposits at an FDIC insured institution
*  up to any level. And we should just make what got done for this group true for everyone immediately.
*  And that's why I'm not making this a bailout or whatever you want to call it for one special
*  class of depositor, but something that now is for everyone. Not that that many people have
*  deposits above $250,000, but still at least it would generalize the treatment that right now
*  is specialized. How do you think about that? There's a couple of things here. I'd like to
*  go back to this idea of privatized gains and socialized losses. Let's look at what the
*  privatized gains we're talking about are for depositors. These depositors, some were earning
*  a little tiny bit of interest, less than the rate of inflation on a money market account. They're
*  earning 4% interest with 5% inflation. They're still losing money actually on that account.
*  Most of the depositors were earning zero interest at all. It was a checking account,
*  which in an era of 5% inflation is losing 5% a year. So when you're talking about these
*  privatized gains that people made that they're now being quote unquote bailed out for,
*  you're talking about a checking account paying 0%.
*  Well, I didn't say there are any privatized gains.
*  Okay. My point is simply that I don't-
*  You said socialized losses.
*  Yes, there are though.
*  There are that.
*  But this isn't like there were some fat cats who made a crap ton of money on this racket called
*  Silicon Valley Bank and then they got bailed out. So, you know, an unsophisticated, financially
*  unsophisticated startup person says, I know how to build this, you know, software product,
*  but I don't know about finance, right? So I'm not very financially sophisticated. So I'll just put
*  my money in a bank. No bank has failed to return money to its depositors since 2008.
*  You know, they don't even think about it. Yes, that's dumb, but it doesn't make them any money.
*  These people aren't getting rich off Silicon Valley Bank.
*  I don't even think it was dumb. I think it's crazy to expect people to do that level of
*  due diligence on a banking institution that's insured by the FDIC. I think you're taking me
*  here when I make this point as saying that we shouldn't have done this. And the question I'm
*  raising is that I think what I find upsetting, to the extent I've been anything upsetting about
*  policies I usually support in these interventions, to be the sense of special treatment,
*  right? The sense that if you are part of something that the Federal Reserve and the FDIC decide is
*  systemically important for some reason or another, and as you're saying, since 2008, they've had a
*  pretty low definition of that, you will get a rescue that is at least not what the law says
*  you're supposed to get, right? It's not sort of built in currently the law. The FDIC says only up
*  to 250, but now you get a different kind of answer. And so one thing that I think might be the right
*  answer here is instead of saying something went wrong here to say it went right, and we should
*  do this for everybody. Every FDIC institution should be insured, basically unlimited. If you
*  want to have your money in a checking account or some kind of savings account, you can have as much
*  money as you want there, and we will just increase the insurance tax on the system so that we can pay
*  that out if anything ever happens. And then you're not doing these weird ad hoc solutions, like this
*  is simply the new rule. So do you think that's a good policy? Should we just generalize this out now?
*  I really have to think about whether that's good policy. So what that means, by the way,
*  is making formal what has been informally true since 2008. Right, that's what I'm saying. Right.
*  So the idea that Silicon Valley Bank got special treatment is held only by people who don't realize
*  that everyone else has gotten that same treatment since 2008. You know, they were no worse off,
*  or they're no better off, I mean, than any other depositors of any bank that's failed since 2008.
*  And I think there have been something like 500 banks that have failed since 2008. And I think,
*  to my knowledge, every single depositor, uninsured or insured, got every cent out of those bank
*  failures every time. So the question is, should we make all deposits of all kinds FDIC insured?
*  I think maybe, maybe not. I'm not 100% sure about that. And I have to think about it.
*  It seems like there's likely to be a downside in some sense. The obvious downside is that if you
*  have every account be FDIC insured, then banks are going to have to take less risk, you know,
*  with their portfolios, which means that when you talk about smaller banks, you're talking about
*  fewer loans. So the original idea of banks is that they're good at evaluating loans. You know,
*  you come in and you say, hey, banker, I need a loan for my auto body shop. And the bank people
*  say, okay, well, we think there's this likelihood that you'll succeed in this likelihood that you'll
*  fail and blah, blah, blah. And they evaluate the things. And then they're very good at allocating
*  credit that way. And that might be more difficult to do if they all had to, you know, be part of
*  this insurance fund. And I have to think carefully about that. I'm not 100% sure. And I don't think
*  we should make this official policy tomorrow. I think we can afford to wait a little while and
*  deliberate about that because there's another similar policy we could do that many people
*  argue would be even better. And that policy is to allow individuals to have Fed accounts,
*  is to just have the government come in. Because if you think about it, why should private companies
*  have to do this business of managing checking accounts? Why should our financial system be
*  contingent on people wanting to have checking accounts? Why can't people just have a checking
*  account at the Fed? Why can't you just come to the government and say, I want a 0% interest rate
*  checking account. Here's my bag of cash. Please put this bag of cash in an electronic repository.
*  And then now you have a checking account. It's not that expensive to run. It's an insanely simple
*  business. And so why doesn't the government just do this itself? Well, let me take the other side
*  of this because I like Fed accounts. And I think we should do them sort of no matter what. But I
*  don't see how that would have actually solved this problem. So as you were saying earlier, and I think
*  it's a very important point, we know that functionally Wells Fargo has this quality.
*  The government under no circumstances is going to let Wells Fargo fail and all the uninsured
*  deposits at Wells Fargo go bust. It would never do that. Wells Fargo is clearly called systemically
*  important. It is every kind of too big to fail assurance under the law. It has to follow those
*  laws. And yet all of these highly sophisticated venture capitalists were advising their people
*  to put their money in this slightly random regional bank that was very important for reasons
*  that seem to me to be somewhat informal, somewhat cultural, etc. within the Silicon Valley ecosystem.
*  And so the government is saying that it would not let that fail. It would not let those deposits go
*  bust. If we set up Fed accounts tomorrow and these same companies had decided not to go
*  into the Fed, which is lame and big government and oh, who cares. But Peter Thiel been telling
*  them bank at Silicon Valley Bank, you know, that's part of like being in the deal fund,
*  they're still going to be there. And if this has become the informal policy since oh, eight,
*  which is not that long, I mean, I do think one of the uncertainties here is, was at some point,
*  are we going to snap back to what we used to do, which is give haircuts on some of these deposits.
*  If this is informal policy, I guess I don't understand why we would not make it the formal
*  policy. And I really don't understand, given that we have something like Wells Fargo out there that
*  already had this kind of guarantee behind it, and everybody knows it, how then we think this would
*  change a failure like this going forward, unless you're going to make everybody bank at the Fed,
*  you still have the problem of a bank that is not the Fed going bust.
*  I think your real problem is that the day you switch to Fed accounts, and everyone knows they
*  can put their money in a runless bank, then you could cause a lot of bank runs. Right. That's
*  another problem. In fact, I'm surprised that the explicit guarantee we gave to the big banks after
*  2008 didn't cause more bank runs, and didn't just turn us into Canada. Right. Canada has a few big
*  banks, and they're all, you know, essentially, strongly government backed and their risk. It's
*  like they have only the big five in Canada. They don't have all these like small little banks
*  running around. And the question is, do we need a banking industry with all these small banks
*  running around? Like, are they better at making loans, evaluating credit quality? What's the
*  economic function that they are serving by being small, maybe riskier banks? And would that business
*  model be eliminated if we FDIC insured all deposits in the land? And in practice, I think that you have
*  your small community banks where it's all FDIC insured anyway, because just individual depositors
*  who don't have more money than 250k. And then I think what we're talking about are these mid-sized
*  banks. Will our economy be worse off in good times or worse off overall? I'd say good times and bad.
*  If we don't have the Silicon Valley banks and the signature banks and the Pac West's,
*  etc. of the world and the First Republics, if those mid-sized regional banks that ostensibly take risk
*  and are able to take risk because they don't have to, you know, fully fulfill the FDIC guarantee,
*  would our economy be worse off? And the answer to that is I don't actually know, and I need to do
*  more research and think about it, but I think that that's not an easy question to answer.
*  So this is a place too, where I think the political economy of this is a little bit confusing
*  to people who haven't had to be involved in it or covered it. So I covered Dodd-Frank and I've had
*  to cover a fair amount of both financial panics and financial regulation fights. And I think the
*  thing people don't know about this, if they're outside it, is there is probably no more powerful
*  political force than small banks. They are more powerful than the big banks, which is a little
*  bit weird. You'd think the big banks would be more powerful, but actually people don't really like
*  them. They're more concentrated, but there's like a small bank, a community bank, a regional bank
*  in the district of not probably literally every member of Congress, but a lot of them.
*  And they're popular. People like their local banks. They sound good in the sort of old
*  Jeffersonian America, right? I mean, Jefferson wasn't about small banks. He was about farmers,
*  but still there's an attraction and like the American mythos to these little banks,
*  so like know their communities and know what their region needs. And it's not, you know,
*  JP Morgan Chase or something. And they lobby like hell to not be in these regulations. Something
*  that has been going on that has driven a lot of us who cover this absolutely mental has been a
*  bunch of these sort of semi-populist sounding VCs running around saying, before the rescue happened,
*  that the federal government has created this two class system and the big banks get all the special
*  treatment and the smaller banks don't. When what actually happened is particularly during the Trump
*  administration, but also during Doug Frank, the smaller banks, including in this case, there was
*  a lobbying effort in which Silicon Valley bank was one of the leaders of the lobbying effort
*  that succeeded in the Trump administration, getting it raised from 50 billion to 250 billion.
*  Because before, if you were about 50 billion, you had these enhanced regulations and stress
*  tests of your assets and so on, and they didn't want that. And so they got out of it. And a lot
*  of people have argued that if that regulation had been kept where it was, this would have been
*  forced to the floor earlier, regulators would have been able to catch it earlier, would have caught
*  it earlier, and it would have stopped the blow up from happening. So first, do you think that the
*  Trump era regulations, the change in them had an effect here? And I guess more broadly, like,
*  how do you think about the political economy of this where the smaller banks want less regulation?
*  They don't want to be sort of treated as the big banks are. They just want the informal guarantee,
*  but not the responsibilities that come with it. Right. And I think mentally, you have to separate
*  banks into three categories instead of two. There's the big banks, of course, but among the banks
*  we're calling smaller banks, there's actually two categories. There are small local banks that are
*  truly small, but have just a few billion dollars of assets. And that have most of their deposits
*  are already FDIC guaranteed formally and always were just a very large percent. Those banks,
*  they don't fail for the kind of reason we saw this week. They could fail for other reasons because
*  they make bad loans and they collapse because they made bad local loans, but they're already FDIC
*  insured pretty much with existing policy. But I think you have to have this third category
*  of midsize banks. And that's exactly the category we let operate. Those were the banks between 50
*  and $250 billion. Are these midsize banks, those are the banks that we gave a special exception to
*  under Trump, the amendment of Dodd-Frank that you just talked about, which was lobbied for by Silicon
*  Valley bank. They probably had an implicit guarantee. They probably kept their implicit guarantee
*  at the time. And they took a lot more risk because of this. And those banks also are the banks whose
*  stocks you saw start to collapse when there was a run on Silicon Valley bank. So when there was this
*  run, you saw big bank stocks dipped a tiny bit and then recovered. And then the medium sized banks,
*  these 50 to $250 billion banks, their stocks were just falling off a cliff. And those were exactly
*  the banks that got deregulated in 2018 under Trump with the Dodd-Frank amendment because they wanted
*  to be deregulated, as you said. So it's that class of banks. So maybe we should just say, okay,
*  guess what? 2018 is done. You're systemically financially important again. We could also say
*  that if you have a certain amount of uninsured deposits, certain percent of FDIC uninsured
*  jumbo deposits, because those are called jumbo, right? They're over the limit. If you have a
*  certain percent of jumbo deposits, you are automatically systemically financially important.
*  And then this thing gets applied. So it's not about how much assets you have. It's about how
*  many uninsured deposits you have. And so then we could allow the small banks, all those little
*  banks that can call their congressmen and put pressure on them, they would be allowed to keep
*  doing whatever they're doing completely unperturbed, serene and calm and do whatever
*  they were doing yesterday. And then the mid-sized banks basically have to either choose to take
*  safe deposits or submit to regulation that will limit their risk. So that's another idea.
*  So let me wander down the side alley here. So a lot of the VCs who have been pushing very
*  effectively and very intensely for the government to come in and save these deposits were also some
*  of the loudest boosters of cryptocurrencies taking over everything. And I think this is
*  sort of interesting because it strikes me as what we're seeing play out here was the exact obvious
*  problem with this sort of crypto takes over the world theory that when your bank fails,
*  when your crypto whatever fails, no one is there to catch you. And we're seeing it that as soon
*  as the bank that these folks relied on failed, they really wanted the government to come in
*  and catch them and use what power and influence they had to make that happen. But I'm curious
*  if you see those being kind of implications here. And the reason I bring this up is not to make a
*  gotcha, but there was an actual coherent and I think cohesive like alternative financial system
*  theory that had really taken over Silicon Valley for a number of years. And it was by the same
*  people who now want the kind of exact opposite to happen for them after this bank failure.
*  But there was this idea that somehow like we would get past this point where the Fed and everybody
*  were sort of coming in and warping the whole system. I'm curious how you look at that.
*  Well, I think that crypto, there's no technology there. It's basically just a ledger for recording
*  deposits and whatever assets or it's an Excel spreadsheet that's maintained by a bunch of
*  different people. That's a very expensive to maintain Excel spreadsheet. So there's no
*  technology there. All the crypto was as a thing was just financialization. At the end of any real
*  tech boom, you see a big burst of financialization. And I think that at the end of the second tech,
*  what I call the second tech boom, although it wasn't really the second, but the social media
*  and mobile boom that really began in the 2000s, but then reached max level in the 2010s. And
*  at the end of that boom, there was a burst of financialization where essentially companies
*  ran out of new stuff. They didn't run out of new stuff to do, but the rate at which they were
*  finding new actual technology to make in terms of mobile stuff and social stuff slowed down.
*  Nobody could really make a big new social network. Mobile apps were all saturated, blah, blah, blah,
*  all this stuff that had been very reliable and business to business like SaaS companies,
*  software as a service that got saturated too. And so what else do we do? Well, let's try to extract
*  money from people by making up assets that they put their money into. And then we walk away with
*  the money. That's financialization. That's the financialization at the end of a real boom. And
*  you see this every time. And crypto, I think we have to understand as finance, not tech. So that's
*  a key point. And then I think that a lot of VCs, but also just a lot of founders and entrepreneurs
*  and people in the tech world were very enthusiastic about this financialization and invented a whole
*  lot of storylines and guff to basically justify the idea that, yes, it is possible to trick a
*  bunch of people out of their money and walk away with it for a little while. And there was a lot
*  of guff about we're going to replace the banking system, but that didn't happen. And so it's not
*  necessarily the exact same people who are now screaming for a bailout. There's an easy narrative
*  where, oh yeah, you tried to fight the banking system and then you tried to fight the government
*  and say, we're going to get rid of the Fed. And then, you know, like a few weeks later,
*  you're screaming from a bailout of the banking system from the Fed, but it wasn't necessarily
*  the same people. Well, some of them were. I mean, yes, I'm thinking about some of the
*  VC class on Twitter. A lot of the actual companies who needed help here were not the same people.
*  But again, I'm in some of them, probably more positive on how sincere people were here than
*  you were. But the reason I think it's interesting is that the big claim made for crypto for a long
*  time was that it solves a trust problem, right? That it solves this problem of, you know, you can
*  now work with a counterparty who you can't really vet because you have this cryptographic ability
*  to make sure the thing that happened in the contract will happen no matter whether or not
*  the person tries to get out of it or the group of people or the institution or whatever.
*  And I always thought this definition, I mean, people have heard me say this on the podcast,
*  probably, but I always thought that definition of trust really got something profound wrong,
*  which is that what people mean when they talk about trust in a financial system
*  is that people want to trust that if they put their money somewhere that is supposed to be safe,
*  and they're basically doing the right thing, that that money will stay there, and it'll be there
*  for them if they need it. And if somebody tries to screw them over, right, like they get scammed
*  out of their money by somebody impersonating their credit card, or their bank makes a bunch
*  of bad decisions and fails, that somebody is going to come in, the government usually,
*  and make it right. And that it's that kind of trust that makes financial systems work.
*  And that kind of social trust and that the trust that somebody is there who can come in and say,
*  okay, you actually did get screwed here, and we're going to make you whole, because we don't
*  want people to operate thinking they can get screwed all the time and have to do that kind of
*  constant level of diligence. And that understanding trust in that way is actually really important
*  for understanding financial systems. I think that's exactly right. And I
*  couldn't have said that better. I think that crypto, or at least Bitcoin, creates one very
*  narrow type of trust through the distributed ledger mechanism, where in fact, trust is a
*  multi-dimensional complex thing that, and Bitcoin basically sacrifices all the other kinds of trust
*  for this one very narrow kind of trust, which you can get anyway with other mechanisms.
*  And so it's not a story that makes sense. And that's why I insultingly called it Guff.
*  When I say Guff, what I just mean is that this whole story of how Bitcoin or crypto in general
*  creates trust, most crypto doesn't even have the Bitcoin mechanism. Most crypto is just completely
*  fly by night deregulated finance without the proof of work mechanism behind it.
*  So that's why that's even more Guff. Guff is my favorite word for a narrative that sounds good,
*  sounds legit, but actually just completely doesn't make sense. And I think you just hit
*  the nail on the head for why the narratives around crypto didn't actually make sense.
*  So I want to end here by talking a bit about the Fed and the harder position it's now in.
*  So we had new inflation data come out today. What did that say sort of in context of what we
*  were expecting and seeing? Well, inflation is not going away. You know, the month-to-month data
*  fluctuates a bit, but then we have very low unemployment. We have high consumption. People
*  are, we have low savings rates. People are still spending down cash that maybe they saved up during
*  the pandemic or something like that. And those are the reasons why inflation is happening. It's
*  not supply shocks, oil back down, shipping costs are back down, all this stuff. When you listen to
*  people who labeled themselves team transitory for years, they said, oh, inflation is just supply
*  shocks and supply shocks will resolve. Well, guess what? No, it was, there was a lot of demand shock
*  in there too, right? Because oil is back down. And so inflation is still here. It's still with us.
*  And there's no sign that it's going to just poof disappear tomorrow. The Fed is going to have to
*  keep raising interest rates and that's going to cause more pain in the financial system.
*  You could see more things break, but the alternative is probably worse. Letting inflation
*  spiral because you're afraid of breaking your financial system will then immediately, like not
*  immediately, but eventually let people know that inflation is unrestrained. And once people know
*  that the central bank has no ability to restrain inflation because it's too afraid of breaking the
*  financial system, inflation will spiral. Well, then you'd have to raise interest rates even more.
*  You will. And you'll have to break a lot more. Like if you think, if you think these interest
*  rate hikes will break the financial system, wait until you see the interest rate hikes,
*  wait until you see Volcker time, right? We're going to have like, you know, people eating Campbell
*  soup in this country like every day. But yeah, so we'll, it'll be bad. We don't want that. We've
*  got to get hold on inflation. That's job number one. And some other things in the financial system
*  may break along the way. And we will have to find ways to let people down easy to cushion the break
*  and Old Testament justice of punishing people for getting a 0% interest rate checking account
*  at the wrong bank. You know, it is not the time for that. So there's been an expectation in the
*  markets a few days ago when the rescues were happening that the federal reserve were probably
*  pausing interest rate hikes. People thought they were going to go quite high on the next meeting.
*  And maybe they, maybe they would just hold for a second now, but this inflation data comes out.
*  It's not dramatically higher than expectations, but what it shows is, as you say, that inflation
*  is not coming down either. It's kind of holding steady well above the fed's target. So do you think
*  even while they're trying to kind of quell this, this banking panic, they should do a significant
*  rate hike. They should just sort of act as if this banking thing hadn't happened. They should
*  solve the banking problem through, you know, ensuring deposits wherever they need to
*  and just keep on the path of sort of overwhelming force on, on inflation. You think, you think the
*  markets were wrong about them holding back and they should just kind of go full forward?
*  I don't know because I don't know exactly how much rate hikes at each meeting is needed to contain
*  inflation, blah, blah, blah. And maybe nobody knows, but I think that if I were predicting what they
*  would, will do, I would say they'll just do a modest hike probably, or maybe pause for one meeting
*  and then do more hikes later to see if this month is just a blip or something along those lines.
*  They'll take the middle path. The fed will take the middle path between worrying about this sort
*  of letting inflation get out of control and putting the economy in, in danger of, you know,
*  major recessions and breaking the whole financial system. Basically, they know both those things
*  are bad and they'll try to walk a middle path between. And it's not very hard to imagine what
*  a middle path would look like. So, and around this whole conversation, we've been talking a lot about
*  treasuries and interest rates, something those of us who cover fiscal politics in Washington have
*  been worrying about anticipating for a while is potentially a big debt ceiling fight over the coming
*  year or two. And the possibility, which, you know, continues to seem like a real possibility
*  that Republicans could drive us into some kind of temporary default on treasuries.
*  And when you sort of look at what it meant for sort of interest rate risk to go up for all these
*  institutions and held treasuries, what should this moment make us think about a debt ceiling
*  default? Like what would happen in the treasury markets and to the, to the institutions that are,
*  that have tried to safely hold a ton of treasuries if you have what would follow
*  from defaulting on the debt?
*  It would be really, really, really, really, really, really bad. That's really bad. So
*  I will say that we wouldn't first default on treasuries. Treasuries are the last thing to
*  default. The thing we do is we wouldn't, the government wouldn't pay people money it had
*  committed to pay. So like pensions and insurance and healthcare, and basically the government
*  stops paying people that it promised to pay. We default not on treasuries, but on our financial
*  obligations.
*  Yeah. But if you go for long enough, you'll eventually default on a treasury.
*  You will eventually do that. That's right. And so last time this was done, 2011,
*  it caused the credit rating agencies to downgrade treasuries, even though we never got close to
*  defaulting on actual treasuries. But that said, if you stop having the government pay money to
*  people who it owes money to, who it has promised to pay that money to, what are those people going
*  to do? They're going to withdraw their money from their bank. Just like when VC money dried up,
*  startups had to withdraw their money from Silicon Valley bank. If government commitments suddenly
*  vanish, people are going to have to start drawing cash from their banks. You could see more bank
*  runs and the government would have to guarantee those deposits. And that would essentially print
*  money, put more money into the economy and complicate the fight against inflation.
*  And so people often think of austerity, forced austerity as fighting against inflation,
*  but in this case, it could contribute to that. Certainly, you know, cause recessions,
*  stagflation. I can't even really imagine what all the consequences of that would be,
*  but I will say just don't do it. Like you're just, you're being an arsonist.
*  You're burning down the U S for no purpose and you're going to hurt your constituents.
*  You're going to hurt everybody. People in red States, you know, conservative voters,
*  small business people who are like one of the most reliable Republican constituencies
*  are just going to get absolutely trashed and their livelihoods and their wealth will just get trashed.
*  And so don't do it. I think that's a good place to end. Also, final question. What are three books
*  you'd recommend to the audience? All right. So one book I would recommend is chip war. If you
*  want to understand the semiconductor export controls and why that is happening, then chip
*  war will explain it. You should really read it. You'll understand semiconductors. The second book
*  is how Asia works, because if you want to understand industrial policy or what industrial
*  policy might look like, what might replace the sort of libertarian laissez faire, we could even
*  say neoliberal policy of recent decades, what might replace that, how Asia works is sort of the
*  book that started people thinking about the alternative. And the third book that I would
*  recommend is called the invisible bridge by Rick Perlstein. It is about the 1970s and about the
*  cultural and political evolution that we went through in the 1970s, which I believe is similar
*  to the one we're going through in the 2020s. So the invisible bridge is my third Noah Smith,
*  you write at no opinion, a sub stack newsletter that I am a proud subscriber to and recommend
*  to others. Thank you very much. Thank you so much.
