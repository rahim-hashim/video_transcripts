# If You’re Reading This, You’re Probably ‘WEIRD’
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [May 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5sji_kJJ5A)
*  So here's the thing, if you're listening to this podcast, you're pretty weird.
*  You're probably very weird, and not just for all the obvious reasons you're thinking of.
*  In social science, really certain corners of it, weird is now an acronym, stands for
*  a certain kind of person, Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic.
*  And weird people who've been the people we've been surveying and studying for a lot of research
*  on psychology, they actually turn out to be different, much more so than they than we
*  often realize or admit.
*  There are all these things we take for granted as basic elements of human psychology and
*  ethics that are actually peculiar to the weird psychology.
*  We take them for granted because we feel them.
*  We take them for granted because we study ourselves and then use that to extrapolate
*  to human nature, but we shouldn't.
*  The idea that we have a stable self that exists across all contexts, that a person's intentions
*  should be central to any evaluation of their actions, that guilt is a widely felt emotion,
*  that self-esteem is crucial for happiness.
*  We treat all these as truisms, but they're not.
*  At least that's the argument made by Joseph Henrik.
*  Henrik is an anthropologist at Harvard who's done really deep, rich cross-cultural research
*  and how different forms of human culture shape our psychologies and into what those psychologies
*  actually are.
*  His 2015 book, The Secret of Our Success, argued that what sets human beings apart from
*  other species is our capacity for cultural learning.
*  His 2020 book, The Weirdest People in the World, takes that argument and extends it,
*  arguing that beginning sometime in the Middle Ages, certain cultural and really religious
*  shifts radically transformed the psychologies of individuals living in Europe and that then
*  the emergence of this weird psychology was a prerequisite to everything from the development
*  of market economies to representative government to human rights.
*  It's a really fascinating argument.
*  And if you take it seriously, it says something really quite profound about the indirect and
*  unusual ways that human beings and human cultures evolve.
*  As always, my email is at zercleinshow.nytimes.com.
*  Joe Henrik, welcome to the show.
*  It's good to be with you.
*  So the premise of your book is that you and me and basically all the people listening
*  to this podcast and virtually all the people in the studies on which we have all based
*  our ideas about what people are like are a little weird, are a little distinctive.
*  Tell me how.
*  Yeah.
*  So the main thing is that a lot of what you read in a psychology textbook or any of your
*  typical psychology papers come from sampling one particular population.
*  And as psychologists and anthropologists and economists began to measure psychology around
*  the world, we found a great deal of variation along things like individualism, the relevance
*  of shame versus guilt, the importance of analytic versus holistic thinking, the role of intentionality
*  and things like moral judgment, and a number of other areas, time, thrift, temporal discounting,
*  and I could keep going.
*  But there's this interesting pattern of global variation, how people think about the world.
*  I want to go through some specific pieces of this.
*  I'll maybe run a very quick experiment with the audience.
*  So I want to go through a bunch of different pieces of this, but let me start by having
*  us all run a little exercise here.
*  So if you say to yourself the words, I am, what fills in the blank?
*  Just take a second.
*  So for me, I think of things like I'm a journalist, I'm a Californian, but there's a study on this
*  you write about, Joe, and I was wondering if you could talk through the I am study.
*  Yeah, it's called the 20 statements test, and they ask people to fill in the I am and
*  then blank or the who am I as another way of approaching it.
*  And they just look at all the things that people respond.
*  And so when you do this with populations in the USA, people say things like, I'm smart,
*  I'm a kayaker, you know, I'm curious, all these kind of things that relate to their attributes
*  and their accomplishments and their aspirations.
*  So things about themselves as an individual.
*  But when you do this in other places, people very quickly translate the question into things
*  about their relationships.
*  So I might say I am a father, I am a brother, I'm a member of a certain group, and those
*  tend to dominate.
*  So you get many more things about relationships, as opposed to things about attributes, accomplishments
*  and aspirations.
*  So this has to do with how people think about themselves.
*  Am I a node in a relational network?
*  Or am I a unitary thing with my own unique attributions and ways of approaching the world?
*  How big are these differences?
*  Because obviously, there's going to be some overlap in the curve here.
*  Yeah, at the extremes, you'll get, you know, American undergraduates will give you no relationships.
*  They never mentioned that they're a child or something like that, a son or something.
*  And then, you know, if you go somewhere like the Messiah in Kenya, they'll give you almost
*  all relational attributes.
*  So it runs the gamut of the spectrum.
*  But of course, lots of places are somewhere in the middle.
*  What is a place that is in the middle?
*  And not just on this, but in a bunch of the things we'll talk about.
*  When we think about the the poles, these different personality typologies can be, what is the
*  place that seems to be more balanced between them than than others?
*  Right.
*  The famous psychologist Richard Nesbitt started doing comparisons between immigrants from
*  Asia that were attending the University of Michigan and then European descent Americans
*  at the University of Michigan.
*  And he was finding differences.
*  So then people started studying Japan and China, Korea, places like that.
*  And so it was thought that there was this big difference between Asia, you know, the
*  East and the West.
*  But it turns out that in many, for lots of things, Asia is actually somewhere in the
*  middle.
*  And you got to go to places like the Messiah in Kenya or somewhere like that, where you
*  have completely different social structure and whatnot to get the full range of difference.
*  So in the book, you call is part of a psychological profile that we're talking about in the West,
*  the individualism complex.
*  Tell me what that is.
*  Right.
*  So for a long time, psychologists and anthropologists have been talking about this individualism
*  complex.
*  And I think at the core of it is the notion that we think of ourselves as a unitary selves
*  and not as a node in a relational network.
*  And that tends to have clustering around it.
*  Things like overconfidence, a reliance on guilt versus shame, a tendency of self enhancement.
*  So putting your best foot forward, emphasizing your attributes and suppressing your deficits
*  or deficiencies, things like that.
*  And you make the point that these different psychological approaches, they don't just
*  emerge for no reason, that there are ways of navigating and succeeding in different
*  cultural institutions.
*  So what is the individualism complex adaptive to?
*  What would make it be the thing that we would select for?
*  Yeah, that's a great way of putting the question.
*  The way to think about it is in the world that individualists are trying to adapt to,
*  there are small families and most of your relationships are optional and potentially
*  ephemeral.
*  So there's a marketplace for finding friends, business partners and marriage partners.
*  The individual has a lot of choice in this and you're cultivating a unique self.
*  So you're trying to emphasize those traits, which will make you interesting to possible
*  friends, possible mates and possible business partners.
*  So it could be honesty, intelligence.
*  These traits tend to be dispositional in the sense that they are operative across context.
*  So when someone says you're honest, they don't mean you're just honest with your friends
*  and the dishonest with everybody else.
*  The suggestion is that you have this trait that stretches across lots of different kinds
*  of interactions.
*  Whereas in other places, you're born into a network and you get by virtue of your birth,
*  lots of responsibilities, lots of social connections, definitions about who you're likely to marry.
*  There could be arranged marriages involved.
*  So really what your job is, is to figure out how to prosper within this pre-built network.
*  If you need to set up a business partnership, for example, you'll look not for someone who's
*  trustworthy and smart, which you might do in the other world, but instead you're looking
*  for someone who has connected to you through lots of social ties because those social ties
*  will make that person trustworthy.
*  You just touched on something that I found fascinating when I read about it, which is
*  that when we talk about people in the weird basket, there's more of a sense of stability
*  in our sense of self.
*  I'm curious to hear you expand on that a bit.
*  How stable, how unstable is this in other places and why would stability be prized,
*  particularly in a situation where you have more choice?
*  You might think in a situation with more choices and more options and more capacity to move
*  between different kinds of institutions and groups and people, that it would select for
*  a mutability, right?
*  You can be this here and that there, that it doesn't, isn't intuitive to me.
*  So I'm curious why you think it is.
*  I mean, the key idea is that there could be reputational effects and in the individualistic
*  world, a lot of people are in the same category, sort of like strangers who you interact with,
*  who you might turn out to have a profitable interaction with, mutually beneficial, could
*  be a friendship, could be a business partnership.
*  And so you want to be known as someone who's honest or someone who's intelligent across
*  all these different contexts.
*  Whereas in the relational world, you'll have some kinds of cousins, for example, that you
*  have a, quote, joking relationship.
*  So anthropologists have documented the joking relationship between what they call cross
*  cousins, which is when your parents are opposite sex.
*  And that's like a very funny, playful relationship.
*  But then with other kinds of cousins, you know, the same genetic distance, you'll have
*  to have a relationship of respect.
*  You'll have to defer to them in conversation.
*  You know, there's no joking around.
*  The same thing, you might have your father and then your father's brother.
*  If it's an older brother, you have to really defer to that older brother and you wouldn't
*  speak in his presence and you take his orders and that kind of thing.
*  So you just have to be mutable across these different contexts.
*  How you're going to behave with your professor is quite different than how you're going to
*  behave with your friends.
*  And you can see that flattening increasing, you know, probably even in our lifetime.
*  So my undergraduate show up in my office at Harvard and say, Hey, Joe, how's it going?
*  That gives you a sense of the kind of just general stranger category.
*  Why do you think we have seen that flattening?
*  I mean, this has gotten a lot flatter in America than it's been in other places.
*  I take your point that it is getting flatter still.
*  There seems to be a general trend against almost any kind of formality, right?
*  I just moved away from San Francisco, but something that has always struck me there
*  is how much the fashion is flattened.
*  The very, very rich people just shop at REI and wear a lot of Patagonia and REI branded,
*  you know, vests.
*  And I mean, this goes back to Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg and hoodies and it, but there
*  is something there about trying to at least aesthetically collapse distinctions and create
*  a kind of flatness that, you know, would not have been even seen as desirable in other
*  times, whether it's true.
*  I think we can argue that.
*  I don't think it is true, but the desire to make it seem true is very present.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that's just the spreading of this notion of egalitarian individualism.
*  You know, we're all just individuals where we have these traits and we can interact freely
*  and we don't have to be scared or anything of other people.
*  Whereas in lots of societies, the very structure and organization of the society is rooted
*  in hierarchy and respect for authority.
*  And that has a bunch of downstream implications.
*  It means that it's easier to come to decisions.
*  Politics works a little bit differently, but you know, you might not go into business with
*  someone, for example, that is very hierarchical, you know, at a different place than you, for
*  example.
*  You make a distinction between self-esteem and other esteem.
*  Tell me about that.
*  Yeah.
*  In an individualistic society, one of the things you're trying to do is cultivate a
*  set of traits that will make you stand out that other people will find appealing as well.
*  So you might have a rule, for example, that you go to the gym every day.
*  And if you don't go to the gym, you might feel guilty and that could affect your self-esteem
*  because you're not living up to the traits that you think.
*  But that doesn't induce shame.
*  Other people don't judge you for that necessarily.
*  You know, your brother doesn't, people don't look down on him because you failed to go
*  to the gym or abide by some of your other norms.
*  Whereas in other societies, there's a much more shared set of rules and things like shame
*  affect your close relatives.
*  So if you do something really shameful, then it actually makes your family feel shame and
*  it brings everyone, lowers their reputational standards.
*  So there do seem to be these big differences.
*  So you know, the relationship between self-esteem and happiness and stuff seems to be very important
*  in weird populations, but not so important in other places.
*  So a lot of what we think of as, you know, good psychology, clinical psychology is actually
*  a kind of weird psychology.
*  I was really struck by this, that you write that quote, in the few non-weird societies
*  where it has been studied, having high self-esteem and a positive view of oneself are not strongly
*  linked to either life satisfaction or subjective wellbeing.
*  And I want to hold on that for a minute because it gets at something that I think is really
*  profound inside of your work, which is not just that in different cultures, people act
*  differently or rate different things or have a different answer to the question of I am,
*  but that when you do shift them along these dimensions, the way you experience the world
*  actually might be pretty perceptually different.
*  I mean, I think to try to inhabit the idea that having high self-esteem, right?
*  Being highly of yourself would not affect how you felt about you or your life is pretty
*  strange, right?
*  That's actually a bigger perceptual gap than I think most of us think about day to day.
*  So what do you make of that finding?
*  But also, having done a lot of this work, how do you think about the contingency or
*  distinctiveness of your own perspective?
*  How different do you think it would be to experience a world from within the cognitive
*  structure of some of the societies you've studied or going back into the past, some
*  of those that you have read about?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that there's a way we can get inside of this if we think, you know,
*  there's a lot of talk in our society about cultivating your true self and finding your
*  passion and this kind of thing.
*  And if you grew up in a world where the real emphasis and the thing that everybody was
*  supposed to do was cultivate their family, care for their elders, and people took real
*  pride in child rearing and social connections and strengthening their family over time,
*  the things that might make you happy would be fulfilling all those culturally acquired
*  goals as opposed to achieving some kind of personal state of being unique and special
*  and having set yourself apart from others.
*  So I just see it as having gotten different kinds of goals early on.
*  So there's another divergence between weird and non-weird populations that I think is
*  interesting here, which is the degree to which we take into account people's intentions when
*  we judge their actions.
*  Can you give me a few examples of how that might differ?
*  So the way we measure this is with the simple anecdote.
*  So we have a simple story that we give people where someone is at a busy market, they have
*  a bag with a few items in it, and in one story, they put the bag down to look at some items
*  that are displayed on a counter and someone else comes up and takes the bag and disappears
*  off.
*  By varying the story in different ways, we can make it clear that the person had a very
*  similar bag, which they put down right next to it, and then they accidentally picked up
*  the wrong bag or a case where it's clearly a theft and they were trying to make off with
*  the goods.
*  And then we ask people questions about how blameworthy the person is, how much they should
*  be punished, things like that.
*  And what we find is that we go all the way from weird societies where it's all about
*  the intention.
*  Really, people want to kind of forgive the guy who made a mistake all the way down to
*  there's no difference.
*  The person is out their goods one way or another.
*  Another way to think about this, if you accidentally burn someone's house down, or if you intentionally
*  burn someone's house down, the bottom line is the person has no house.
*  So it just turns out that how important those intentions are, those mental states, and you
*  can do it with beliefs or intentions, really varies across societies from places where
*  it's not important at all to places where it's super important.
*  It's probably the most important single factor.
*  This predicts a bit where we're going to go in this conversation, but a big theme of your
*  work is about how these differing temperament, psychologies end up netting out in cultural
*  and governmental and societal institutions.
*  And so how do societies that differ dramatically on this question of intentions, how do their
*  legal or retributive or judicial systems end up differing?
*  Yeah.
*  And so you can see this in the history of European law, where there's a lot of discussion
*  and kind of logic chopping and labels for different mental states that characters might
*  have when doing something that could be a crime.
*  Like did they intend to do it?
*  Did they think the thing that they did could do it?
*  So there's all these ways that lawyers break down the mental states of the actors, and
*  each of these has implications for the nature and details of the crime and the degree of
*  culpability and the punishment and all these kinds of things.
*  But lots of societies have just done the simple thing.
*  Like if you go back and you look at pre-Christian law codes, if you accidentally shoot a guy
*  with an arrow, then you have to pay a certain blood price to his family.
*  And nobody cares if the arrow glanced off of a deer or if you are just trying to kill
*  him.
*  And then you see this in lots of other societies where intentionality either plays a no role
*  or a smaller role than the sort of obsession over the details of the mental states.
*  And just to make it clear that this is also part of religion.
*  So if you get to Protestantism, it's all about faith, right?
*  You can somehow get to heaven by just having faith.
*  Faith alone, no good works matters, whereas the Catholics are more about the good works
*  and the faith together.
*  Right?
*  So Protestantism is kind of extreme on how important this is.
*  In other religions, people don't talk a lot about mental states.
*  It's really like, are you doing the rituals?
*  Are you part of the community?
*  Are you engaged?
*  You know, that kind of thing.
*  I think there can be a tendency to look at the evolution, the selection towards these
*  psychologies or caring about intentions or whatever it might be as almost like teleological,
*  right?
*  We are evolving towards a higher moral state.
*  The arc of the universe is bending towards a kind of moral justice.
*  I don't think you see it that way.
*  And so make the case for me on some of these, like for instance, you know, the relational
*  dynamics or the intentional dynamics or taking into account of attention the ways in which
*  our particular way of looking at this, you know, may not be some better way of doing
*  it necessarily just different, right?
*  When you talk to people in these societies and you kind of try to explain the way you
*  see it or the way the place you come from sees it, what do they tell you?
*  What do you hear that you find convincing?
*  So one of the things that always sticks in my mind, I was talking to, I do work in these
*  remote islands in Fiji and I was discussing with this old Fijian elder, you know, why
*  it is when they have a council meeting to make decisions about the, how things are going
*  to happen in the village, that only a small number of elders has a discussion with the
*  chief.
*  Everybody else just sits quietly in the background.
*  And then that small committee of old guys will make a decision without any input from
*  anybody else in the room.
*  And I said, why not do like majority vote?
*  Like everyone could just vote and you can make a decision that way.
*  And then actually I thought of that because where I come from and he was like, you know,
*  forget about women, right?
*  We only got as far as discussing with the men might do.
*  He says, how can an 18 year old who has no children and has never taken care of the clan
*  or the family have the same way in on this decision as I have someone who has grandchildren
*  and who has taken care of this big, very successful clan?
*  Those things just don't seem like they should be the same, right?
*  So there's a certain logic to that.
*  That kind of makes sense.
*  So this is a kind of experiment, vignette type experiment from sociology.
*  And in the experiment, you're in a car and your friend is there and you can kind of vary,
*  you can make it a family member too, but in the basic version, it's a friend.
*  The friend is driving too fast for the conditions a little bit recklessly and they hit someone
*  and killed them.
*  And then, you know, a law case is going to occur and your friend's lawyer says, if you
*  testify that your friend was going under the speed limit, that he'll get off, it'll be
*  fine.
*  Nobody else was there.
*  Or you can tell the truth in court.
*  And I've even presented this in class and, you know, my classes are pretty diverse.
*  Some members of the class can't believe that anybody would tell the truth in court, but
*  this varies tremendously across populations with Canadians.
*  90% of Canadians will tell the truth in court.
*  At least that's what they say they would do.
*  Whereas in other places that it would be crazy to tell the truth in court.
*  You got to help your friend.
*  Your friend needs you.
*  Aren't you a good friend?
*  And so those are two virtues that are trading off.
*  But how you trade those virtues off has a big effect on the effectiveness of legal institutions,
*  right?
*  This is a place to go back to the question asked a second ago where I think the non weird
*  response actually makes a lot of intuitive sense.
*  You know, in this particular case, right?
*  You're trading off the interest in a way of this faceless impersonal institution, the
*  legal system over someone you care about.
*  It's not a case where they did something where to go back to the point of intention very
*  deeply.
*  I mean, they weren't trying to do this maliciously, right?
*  They made a mistake anybody can make.
*  And so you can kind of, I think, see the not just the rationality, but in some very deep
*  way the morality of siding with those who are nearest to you, right?
*  Siding with the people you care about.
*  How do you understand it?
*  Does that evolution away from that happen?
*  Because I do think that would have been the much more normal reaction almost all through
*  history.
*  And then eventually you get to Canada.
*  How do you get to Canada?
*  One of the things that I try to push in the book or try to really press on is this idea
*  of an interpersonal pro-sociality or morality versus an interpersonal.
*  So one is, you know, this morality you have with strangers towards arbitrary rules, whether
*  it's paying your taxes, giving blood to strangers, all these things that help make society run.
*  But it's really kind of faceless and you're not really helping anybody you know, versus
*  the kind of more normal human morality where, you know, I got friends and family and I want
*  to do stuff to help them and those are my priority.
*  Now, of course, everybody has that interpersonal morality, but it's a question of how much
*  emphasis you're putting on one and how you're going to make the tradeoffs versus that sort
*  of general principle, don't lie in court.
*  It's required to make the system run.
*  People can't be always lying in court.
*  So it's that kind of tradeoff.
*  And then much of my book is about trying to lay out how that unfolded over centuries to
*  get us to the place where we are today.
*  And you shouldn't think of today as an endpoint.
*  I mean, I think things are dynamic and directions are changing and that sort of thing.
*  Let's talk a bit about that space of evolution, though.
*  And I want to I'll keep going through some of the dimensions of weirdness.
*  But but I'm interested here because something your book is at pains to argue is we have
*  a bit of I think it's fair to call it now myth in weird societies that what caused all
*  this was our devotion to higher order enlightened principles, impersonal rules.
*  You know, we care about markets and codes of ethics and ethical philosophy.
*  And I think you show pretty conclusively and we'll get into the way family structures
*  change. But I think you show pretty conclusively that religion has been just this unbelievably
*  powerful driver of cultural evolution and arguably is behind a lot of the personality
*  changes. It made things like the Enlightenment like believing in something like the Bill
*  of Rights possible.
*  So so tell me a bit about the role of religion and what you might call non rational principles
*  in getting us to this place where impersonal structures and principles can be so dominant.
*  So the first is kind of an anthropological observation is that, you know, if we look
*  at the database of religions in different societies, many societies have relatively
*  weak whimsical, you know, they might have a morality like a person, but they look it
*  looks quite different than the kind of big moralizing gods that we would find in Islam
*  or Christianity and religions like that.
*  So I've long been interested in how the beliefs in these more powerful, more moralizing gods
*  emerged. And myself and lots of collaborators have made the case that societies that had
*  beliefs in these more powerful moralizing gods were able to galvanize more cooperation
*  in larger groups. So if you believe that God was incentivizing you with, say, heaven and
*  hell, then that can lead people to behave in somewhat more pro social ways and allow,
*  you know, trade mutually beneficial transactions, larger cooperation, cooperation and warfare.
*  And so simple experiments that we've done is one is just to go around the world to different
*  societies and, you know, we're going to remote villages in Africa and Fiji and New Guinea
*  and stuff and just, you know, asking people questions, getting measurements of their degree
*  to which they believe in a God that is moralizing and punishing that has control over the afterlife.
*  And we find that if we give people a choice between allocating money in a way that the
*  experimenter can't be sure what they did to their community or themselves versus some
*  co-religionist distant stranger who they don't know, they're more fair. They're not totally
*  fair, but they're more fair towards the stranger in this monetary allocation when they report
*  believing in these more powerful moralizing gods. And then as a kind of addendum to that,
*  you can take people who do believe in the moralizing gods and unconsciously slip them
*  cues of religion or of their God and then have them do these monetary allocations that
*  economists like. And then they're more generous or they're more adhering to the pro-social
*  norms, more equal divisions with the distant stranger when we've unconsciously slipped
*  them cues. There's also cool natural experiments where you can use the call to prayer and the,
*  you know, the call to prayer gives them a little boost. They're a little more pro-social
*  after the call to prayer.
*  Would it be fair to gloss your view of human beings here to say that you believe much less,
*  in a human nature than is, I think, the culturally dominant story. And what you tend to believe
*  in is much more of a cultural nature that we are actually quite plastic under different
*  cultural equilibriums and as such can be moved and changed and shifted and formed into many
*  more shapes as human beings, depending on what culture we grow up in, then I think a
*  lot of us appreciate now.
*  Yeah, I think that is a fair gloss. The only place where I'd want to shape that a bit would
*  be, I mean, I teach human nature as a general education requirement at Harvard. And the
*  thing I emphasize in that class is that we're a cultural species, that our reliance on this
*  cultural learning is actually part of our evolved phenotype. So we've genetically evolved
*  to come into the world as babies and start imitating and acquiring and using cues to
*  figure out who to pay attention to and drinking in all this. So we have a lot of extra brain
*  and we have changes in our developmental cycle, which allow us to acquire social norms
*  during mid childhood, say ages five to 10. We internalize them, so we use them to help
*  us navigate the world. We're willing to pay costs if the norm demands those costs. But
*  that can lead to all kinds of different ways of thinking about the world, because even
*  something like whether we see a visual illusion depends on the world we construct. So one
*  of my favorite experiments are these, the Mueller-Lyer illusion, which is the two arrows
*  where one the arrows are in and the other the arrows are out. Well, if you grow up in
*  a world without carpentered corners, and anthropologists have done the work in the 1960s, you actually
*  don't see that illusion. So you literally see the world differently. And I think that
*  captures a lot of some of the stuff we were talking about earlier with the role of self
*  esteem and stuff. You literally see the world differently.
*  You have a great line here, you're right. You can't separate culture from psychology
*  or psychology from biology, because culture physically rewires our brains and thereby
*  shapes how we think. Your example there with the carpenters corners is I think a pretty
*  good example of that. So how does culture rewire our brains?
*  The idea is that we come in with a degree of plasticity in order to help us acquire
*  the information processing that allows us to navigate the institutional landscapes,
*  the incentives that are built up in the institutions. So just my favorite example, and
*  the one I start the book off with is when you learn to read, you get specialized neurocircuitry
*  in your left ventral hemisphere. It impinges on some of your facial processing. So literate
*  people are right biased in their facial processing, but non literate people are much more symmetrical
*  in their facial processing. So what neuroscientists thought was a product of humans, a right bias
*  in the brain in terms of processing faces, turns out to be a product of literacy, because
*  you spend all this time as a child building this machine that can read. It reads automatically.
*  One of the fun things I say in the book is that if I show you a word, you can't stop
*  yourself from reading it. Even though this is just a learned skill, it's a thing that
*  most cultures didn't do over human history, but now it's an automatic piece of our brain.
*  It takes up neurogeography. It affects things that have nothing to do with reading. So you
*  process speech differently once you've learned to read. We have a thicker corpus callosum,
*  so we know the actual biology is different, but this is all due to this cultural value
*  on reading.
*  So let me then use this as the bridge over to this other set of ideas. I kind of think
*  of you as known for two big ideas. One is weird cultures, the weird personality type,
*  and obviously there are many other co-authors on that and everything. But the other, and
*  in some ways a part of your work that has shaped my thinking more, is around cultural
*  evolution. So people are very familiar with individual evolution, the idea that there
*  is a selection pressure and so much in who we are can be traced back to what gave us
*  biological fitness to reproduce. What is cultural evolution? How do cultures evolve? What are
*  the pressures on them that help them do that? And then how does that then differ from individual
*  evolution?
*  Yeah, so I come at this by thinking about how natural selection would have shaped our
*  genes to give us minds that allowed us to acquire information from other people. So
*  it begins with the individual and how they can adaptively learn, when they should learn
*  from the group, say some kind of conformist effect, when they should attend to prestigious
*  people, how they should integrate information from different people. But if everyone's doing
*  that over generations, you can get products and those products can be technologies that
*  are so complex that no individual could figure out them in their lifetime. And eventually
*  people don't even know how it works. They just use it and it does work. Another thing
*  would be an institution. So institutions long predate written laws. So something like marriage
*  is just a cluster of social norms about who can marry who, what the relative responsibilities
*  are in the marriage, who pays who, you know, that kind of thing. But then the social structure,
*  then everybody who comes after that has to grow up in this world that's where the social
*  networks have been organized by, you know, some norms about who marries who and where
*  people have to live after they get married. So in that sense, it creates this, this cultural
*  niche that people's minds have to adapt to. And I make the case that this has been going
*  on for over a million years and has shaped much of our genetic evolution. So our genes
*  have had to respond to the fact that we create these cultural products. The simplest example
*  is fire and cooking. So there's good evidence that that goes back pretty far. But if you
*  look at our physiology, our stomachs and our large intestines, our teeth and stuff, we're
*  an animal that's dependent on cooked food, cooking, denoches, the proteins, it breaks
*  things down. Essentially, it's digestion outside the body. And so it means there's
*  much less need for all the digestive tissue that we see in other apes. So if you think
*  about other apes, they have this big spreading rib cage that comes out and they have these
*  large stomachs, that's actually for their large intestines to give them extra space
*  to break down fibers and process meat and things like that. But humans don't have that
*  because we cook the stuff and then we do the digestion outside. So it's shaped our physiology,
*  but it's strictly, you know, none of us know how to make fire innately. This has to be
*  learned from growing up in a particular place. So it's a simple example of gene culture
*  coevolution. But I think that social norms and institutions and the creation of languages
*  has also fed back and shaped aspects of our genetic evolution.
*  Walk me through how human children develop compared to newborns in other species.
*  The first thing is that biological anthropologists study this and it looks like children are
*  born premature in the sense that very young human babies are helpless and they seem to
*  come out too early. And the main reason many think that they come out too early is that
*  their heads are getting too big. So, you know, we have a basic primate body design and if
*  that head gets too big, it can't get out through the uterus and whatnot. And so babies come
*  out before that head gets too big. And then the baby has had continues expanding and it
*  can be taken care of. And humans have all these extra parents, these call them allo
*  parents that help and food sharing, all that kind of stuff creates this environment where
*  you can raise a very altricial, helpless baby in this kind of world. But humans also have
*  this unique period after about age five or something called middle childhood. And that's
*  where we have quite big brains, but we still have little bodies. And this seems to be the
*  period when kids learn all of this stuff while growing up. So it looks like selection has
*  monkeyed around with gestation. And then we have very short nursing periods or shorter
*  nursing periods than other animals, probably because we have, you know, we can break down
*  the food with cooking and process in other ways. And then we have this new period middle
*  childhood, where we learn all the norms and get a lot of the details of the culture. And
*  then finally, when we have that, then we get the body expansion. And then adolescence you
*  can think of as like apprenticeship time. So adolescence, you start doing adult like
*  things, working with adults, eventually, you know, getting up into proficiency by the time
*  your 20s. Anthropologists studying hunter gatherers, you don't really even get the best
*  hunters. This is thinking about the male occupation, usually until say mid 30s, 40s or whatnot.
*  So there's a lot of knowledge that you have to learn in order to be the most competent
*  person in the community.
*  So we have these genes, we have these aptitudes, we have these capabilities, but they don't.
*  I read a lot of sci fi that has some kind of mechanistic way of moving one culture's
*  ideas into the next generation, right? You know, you stick a computer chip or download
*  into an AI or read a book about spiders where they sort of somehow encoded in a sack and,
*  but we don't have that. And so the societies that have out competed each other and that sort of
*  have won this cultural evolution game, at least for now or for a period, have developed, you know,
*  what are fundamentally cultural technologies that have helped them cooperate and pass knowledge
*  around. And a lot of these in your book seem to be encoded in religion. And you have this view,
*  I think, of religion as having at its explicit level, right, a story about God or gods and how
*  the world works and moralities. And then beneath that, a set of things like ritual and collective
*  dance and other things that are really incredibly powerful technologies of cultural transmission.
*  So can you tell me about how those two things interact? Why are the structures of religion
*  such an important part of your book and an important part of this sort of cultural
*  evolution story? Yeah. So it really comes from, you know, my background, a PhD is in anthropology.
*  And when you look across diverse human societies, you don't see the neat partitioning that we tend
*  to think about the world. Like, you know, a typical partitioning where we have like the political
*  scientists study politics, the economists study economics, there's some theologians and stuff who
*  take care of religion. But in other societies, the religion is woven throughout the production
*  system. And then there's rituals associated with production, which is part of exchange.
*  All of this is justified by mystical beliefs and, you know, reified and rituals, which people do. And
*  we now know that rituals actually have a big effect on bonding people. And whether it's the
*  marching together or moving together in synchrony or listening to music together, or just doing it
*  repeatedly seems to have these interesting psychological effects. So societies have evolved
*  and figured out ways to do that. And as you mentioned, one of the features of cultural
*  evolution that is probably not an important feature of genetic evolution for humans is this
*  competition among societies. So you get this sorting of different institutions. And, you know,
*  so you get production systems and distribution systems, but they're interwoven with religion,
*  and religion makes them do better. So one of the societies that I discuss in the book is
*  the Arapesh from New Guinea. And there, if things are going poorly for the village,
*  they'll reinitiate some rituals. But they think they're doing it to appease the God, their God,
*  who they think is causing bad stuff to happen because he's not happy. Now, this often leads
*  to good things happening because they've done the ritual and they've rebonded and now they're
*  cooperating again. So they got kind of the wrong theory about, at least in my view, they have the
*  wrong theory about the world. But it causes them to do something that's really helpful, which is
*  kind of redo the rituals, rebond and begin cooperating again as a group. So this process
*  has affected the evolution of religions and eventually gives us the kind of big, powerful
*  moralizing gods that we're all familiar with. I've heard you talk about a study about which kinds of
*  communes, and I happen to be very interested in communes, survived and thrived, or at least lasted
*  for longer periods of time in the 20th century, and how it maps on to this sort of question of
*  religion as a bonding force. Can you talk about that? So in the United States, there was a great
*  awakening and a proliferation of communes. Some of the communes were religious and some weren't.
*  And then you can kind of use this as a laboratory, you can then ask the question, which one lasts
*  the longest and has the most number of members? Well, one group that clearly won was the Mormons.
*  And then there's also a group called the Hutterites. Other groups like the Shakers had a
*  norm where you weren't allowed to have sex, right? The group could only grow by in migration.
*  That one didn't make it. And notably, the ones that were religious in context were the ones that had
*  the longest duration. So the ones where it was just a bunch of political ideologues getting
*  together and forming a group, they tended to sputter out and they didn't win the long race.
*  I took your book as being fundamentally pretty pessimistic on two things that I think are fairly
*  widely believed right now. One is the ability to change cultures dramatically just by telling
*  them to change. But almost every major story of change I could think of from the book
*  was pretty indirect. You created a lot of cooperation, usually around a religious story,
*  and that ended up having these very profound downstream impacts. Whereas the much more
*  straightforward, you know, we're all going to do this because it's the right thing to do. And we're
*  a bunch of rationalists who have decided to live together in this way. It doesn't seem to have a lot
*  of staying power. And so kind of downstream from that, I think it would be intuitive for a lot of
*  secular weird people to believe they're probably much better at shaping societies more profoundly
*  and potently because, you know, we're free of all this superstition and content weirdness.
*  But in fact, it seems to me a lesson potentially the book is it's actually much harder for
*  societies to evolve if they don't have the cooperative power provided by belief and rituals
*  that emerge from belief in something higher that there seems to be some kind of capacity of that
*  to get people to do the somewhat illogical, very difficult things like say, don't eat pork, or take
*  the Sabbath off to talk about sort of Jewish examples, but you can pick them from whatever
*  religion you want that end up bonding a community together at the level that allows them to sort of
*  achieve really, really great things. Is that your view that a lot of this is indirect and that we
*  will lose something pretty profound if we continue to secularize in terms of our ability to have this
*  kind of cultural evolution? I definitely agree with the first part, this kind of enlightenment
*  notion is that, you know, we built the world through rationality. And if we could just convince
*  people to be rational, they will. So that I'm definitely pessimistic on and I think there's
*  tons of examples from economic development to all kinds of things that support that.
*  One of the things that I'm interested in is whether we can harvest insights from religion,
*  use of ritual, things like that, to improve secular impersonal institutions, build better
*  organizations, that kind of thing. So I'm not in favor of, you know, spreading supernatural agents
*  because we think they'll be effective, but I think there's wisdom embedded in religious
*  traditions that maybe is underused in impersonal secular institutions. I want to press on this
*  for a minute because I don't quite buy what you just said. Okay. And I'm not 100% believe that
*  you buy it because so many of the examples you give and of the actual research you give has to
*  do with the way really truly complex rituals. I mean, very complex dances and fasting and
*  collective movement and things you just really can't get people to do. You can't go to people
*  and say, you should fast once a week and do a lot of dances and do a lot of praying and so on.
*  Because ultimately this maps onto some kind of human synchronicity mechanism that's going to
*  help you cooperate. The real lesson I took from the book is that religion, because it gives you
*  a reason to do things that don't themselves have an obvious logical justification, allows you to
*  band together these cooperation mechanisms. It kind of nothing else does. I mean, you can't be
*  just in a political system. Can you imagine Joe Biden coming out to the Democratic party tomorrow
*  and saying, listen, a really important thing for us Democrats is to work together. And as such,
*  I am asking all of you to stop eating fish three days a week. And once every six months,
*  I would like you all to go to the ocean. And I would like you to grab a bunch of paper and
*  throw it in as a way of expiriting your sins. He's not going to do that because nobody would do it,
*  but it would probably be very good for cooperation among Democrats if they did it. And this just
*  seems to me to be an actually pretty big thing. I think it's often talked about why do Mormons
*  do so much better in America than most other groups? And they have a lot of very complex
*  religious rituals that have sustained in ways that most other religious groups have not been
*  able to sustain the rituals. And as such, there's a really high level of pro-sociality and cooperation
*  in Utah, much higher than in other places in the country. And so it does seem to me that something
*  is being lost. It probably cannot just be gained through rationalism because it is in some ways,
*  the illogical complexity of the thing itself that is working, but nobody's going to do that precisely
*  because it is so illogical and complex, unless they believe there is some kind of
*  punishment that is indirect for not doing it. I mean, the kind of thing I had in mind is,
*  would be in the service of some notion of, let's just, let's take the US since that's where we are.
*  It would be in some notion of some kind of set of American commitments, principles. We have lots of
*  principles, lots of commitments. We like national service. So you graduate high school, everybody
*  does either military or national service or something like that. It's a shared sacrifice.
*  You're together with your fellow Americans. You're working. Another thing would be the
*  ritual of saying the pledge of allegiance at the beginning of the day. If you want to build
*  national identity, you need tools like that. Now, of course, I would immediately caution that if you
*  build too strong an American identity, we kind of need a global identity at the moment. So you have
*  to think about those kinds of things, but there are ways to introduce costly activities and they
*  would be justified by commitment to truth justice in the American way, say, or some larger, some
*  supra US commitment or something like that. But those kinds of policies, at least, are ideas.
*  I want to loop back then to weirdness because one of the stories that the book is telling is that
*  weirdness, this sort of psychological profile and the world built on top of the psychological
*  profile, which is our governments and our institutions and our markets and so much of it.
*  You really describe this as a world the Catholic Church built. Tell me how the Catholic Church
*  built it. I think that the oldest and most important of human institutions is the family.
*  Weird people tend to have a peculiar view of the family because many of us grew up in these
*  monogamous nuclear households that are either loosely or not very connected to other households
*  in the area, but that's not the story for most of humanity. In fact, the kinship unit was the
*  center of production and distribution and often a religious center with ancestor cults and things
*  like that. Chinese is the classic case. What the church unknowingly did, unwittingly did,
*  was it adopted a series of prohibitions and prescriptions that dismantled the intensive
*  kinship systems of Europe and broke them down over centuries into monogamous nuclear families.
*  Now, some people will be familiar with the famous incest taboos where at first the Catholic Church
*  around the sixth century outlaws marriage to first cousins and then it becomes second cousins
*  and then eventually stretches out to sixth cousins, which are so distant that most people,
*  we can't even track who your sixth cousins are. So essentially a taboo is anybody in your relational
*  circle. It includes athennial relatives, so in-laws, and it includes spiritual relatives
*  and it forces you to get married to people quite socially distanced from you.
*  And so this, the idea is this would have begun to rewire the social network. There were also laws
*  about inheritance where the church wanted the individual to inherit and not the group,
*  so it broke down collective inheritance, which is very common across lots of societies.
*  And this occurred over centuries and actually transformed the church from within. And then the
*  church began developing secular procedures and new law procedures and these became models which were
*  then used in secular systems, charter towns, developed a network of bishoprics, which is one
*  of the ways we're able to figure this out. We look at how long different regions of Europe were under
*  a particular bishop and then we look at a lot of things, but one is the contemporary psychology.
*  One of the things that emerges from this is a set of more impersonal institutions that you really
*  understand as helping to explain why some regions have developed in the way they have,
*  why others haven't. I thought in many ways the strongest bit of data here is from Italy. Do
*  you mind talking through that? So Italy has long been a puzzle for social scientists because on the
*  one hand, Italy in the north, it's famous for the Renaissance and the emergence of the banking
*  industry and the south is famous for corruption and the mafia and whatnot. So, you know, what's
*  going on in Italy and what most people don't realize is that northern Italy was under something
*  called the Carolingian Empire. So this is Charlemagne around the year 800. He has this large
*  empire. He's teamed up with the pope and they're gradually creating the power system. And one of
*  the things that the Carolingian emperors are concerned about was implementing this marriage
*  and the family program. So northern Italy gets this high dosage of the marriage and family program,
*  while southern Italy is some of it's under the Orthodox Church centered in Byzantine,
*  Islamic rulers are present in places like Sicily, Sardinia seems to be outside of most of this.
*  And so southern Italy only gets incorporated under the pope in the sense and part of this
*  whole enterprise much later in history than northern Italy is. So what we were able to do is take
*  say rates of cousin marriage from 20th century Italy and we can use that to explain variation
*  in corruption, whether people put money in banks, their kind of general trust,
*  a number of different measures. And so it helps, I think, explain this kind of puzzle that's Italy.
*  Aaron Norris So I find this whole, all the evidence you present on this so great, actually. I love
*  arguments like this. I love arguments that something we didn't understand had effects we
*  would have never predicted that led to, you know, the world that we now live in. And I also want to
*  maintain some skepticism because in anything like this, we're sort of working backwards,
*  we can see, you know, one part of Italy went one way, another one the other way. Now we're
*  trying to test against data we have. And there is just a lot of correlational data here. I mean,
*  you're looking at say, modern day democratic attitudes or working hours, and then like the
*  percentage of Catholic missions in an area 500 years ago. And so I guess one question I have for
*  you is what is your actual confidence level that this explains a very high level of modern
*  development? And maybe one way of asking it is that, you know, in the past, however many decades,
*  we've seen a tremendous rise in East Asian countries, right? They have had developmental
*  stories that are sort of unlike any other region in that period. And without it been something this
*  would have predicted, right? With, you know, when you kind of think of pushing the story forward,
*  as opposed to backwards, if you were sitting there in 1950, trying to imagine which countries would
*  escape poverty, and then which would be able to escape the middle income trap, would you have said,
*  Oh, yeah, like South Korea and Japan and a couple of these are really going to do it. What is, I
*  guess, your level of confidence that this can explain as much as you're trying to explain with
*  it? Great question. So we talked a bit about Italy, I could tell you the story about Europe,
*  which would be similar, the rest of Europe. So I think one of the ways to get at these ideas,
*  because, you know, if you're a historian, you could possibly think of all kinds of different
*  contingencies, you could try to think of things that are uncontrolled for that may be relevant.
*  So what I like to do is let's test it somewhere else. So there's data from the just the Democratic
*  Republic of Congo. So totally different place. Don't tell me any stories about particular
*  European rulers or anything particular to Europe. What we have is the city of Kananga,
*  where people migrate from villages all around the DRC. And those villages are varying distances from
*  historical Catholic missions. So if we look at those people today, those from villages that were
*  closer to historical Catholic missions have simpler families, fewer kinship ties, and a more
*  morally universalistic psychology. So they have more of the weird kind of psychology that I think
*  traces to this taking a part of the family. Okay, let's go let's go to China, we can test it in China
*  because so that now the church is out of the picture, but the details of the agricultural
*  systems affect the intensity of these kinship systems. So in rice growing parts of China,
*  you get very intensive clans, we can check that with data on clan genealogies, you know, going
*  back 1000 years, and then we can look and see if that can explain contemporary variation
*  among Han Chinese. So throw out anybody who's not Han, just look at Han Chinese, so get ridding
*  messy variation. And then we find that people from counties or provinces that have differing
*  amounts of rice growing have the expected changes in psychology. We can do a similar thing in India.
*  And then most recently, some colleagues from the University of British Columbia looked at the United
*  States. And so cousin marriage began to pop up in parts of the US. And then secular laws outlawed
*  cousin marriage. And so you can see a decline in those subgroups in those kinds of families that
*  were intermarrying, and then long term economic prosperity, so higher incomes. So it's kind of a
*  natural experiment because different states in the US crank this on at different times. And because
*  we have the continuous US census, or at least my colleagues at the University of British Columbia
*  do, they can show these long term effects. So there's just a lot of different converging lines
*  of evidence that help build my confidence that there might be something to this. And then of
*  course, as a scientist, I'm like, well, what's the alternative explanation you want to offer for this?
*  And then I want to let those compete. And I actually believe there's definitely something
*  to it. But I wonder how much when we think about the pace of global development, and the sort of
*  weight of what is needed to achieve these institutions and the sort of impersonal nature
*  of them and the ability to have a society where you're not operating in high trust kinship networks
*  that allows for kind of very modern forms of economic cooperation. And I guess one thing that
*  makes me wonder about the weight given to Catholicism here is that it would make me think that
*  development in much of Latin America and Africa would have been stronger than it's been,
*  particularly around these kinds of institutions and their level of corruption and so on. Because
*  if you just run a search on what countries have very, very high levels of penetration
*  of the Catholic Church, you'll get a lot of countries in Latin America and in Africa.
*  But you wouldn't see that line up all that cleanly with the kinds of markets and institutions
*  that you're talking about spring from this. So how do you think about the places where there
*  is a lot of Catholicism, but you don't seem to be seeing the effects that you're claiming for it?
*  Well, let me first, I want to finish the other half of your question. So 1950 and looking at East
*  Asia, what you see there is the adoption of a lot of Western civil law. So, you know, China ends
*  polygyny, it burns the genealogies, it's trying to destroy its clans, the one child policy,
*  which comes later, that ends all cousins. So if you don't have cousins, you can't have cousin
*  marriage. So they essentially do in a period of about five decades, what the church took 500 years
*  to do in terms of completely altering the family structure. So they're implementing the marriage
*  and family program that the church implemented, and they have the full power of the Chinese state
*  to do it. And the Japanese actually get started on this first. In 1880, the Meiji restoration
*  is about actually copying, in some cases, literal civil codes that were copied from Europe that have
*  all these rules about marriage and the family. And in societies with high levels of conformity,
*  hierarchical decision making, you can implement these things much more quickly than amongst a
*  bunch of disagreeable individualists. So what would be great is if I could predict the future,
*  right? But at least based on that, the kind of East Asian part fits. Now we've tried to deal with
*  your other question in the following way. So this is, we have nighttime satellite illumination data
*  from the entire world. And we think we can use that as a proxy for economic growth. And then we
*  have the map, which appears in the book, of the intensity of different kinship structures around
*  the world. And what we can do is we can look at places like Latin America and Africa and elsewhere,
*  and we just compare different ethnic groups in the same country. So we're removing all the country
*  level stuff, country level politics from this, and just comparing ethnic groups within the same
*  country. And what we find is that ethnic groups that had more intensive kinship traditionally
*  are darker, averaging data from right around 2010 or so. So it looks like economic prosperity
*  measured as light illumination is associated with groups that traditionally had weaker kinship
*  intensity. And our story is that because of the institutions built in Europe are the ones that
*  have expanded around the world and now dominate, they fit within the kind of psychology and the
*  social structure that goes along with low intensity kinship structure. And so it's easier for them to
*  engage in world markets and become more prosperous. One thing I find interesting about the point you
*  just made on some of the East Asian societies is it does go in the opposite direction of one of the
*  concerns I was raising earlier, which is, you know, what you're saying is that they were able to
*  impose much more directly and much more by force what the Catholic Church did sort of indirectly,
*  right? If the Catholic Church was saying, well, God doesn't want you to do this. China just said,
*  well, we don't want you to do this. And actually, we're going to put a much sharper
*  constraint around it than anyone else will. And I'm not here to support the one child policy and do
*  not support the one child policy. But it does, I think, suggest and not, again, taking the point
*  that China went way, way, way too far on this and had very bad years as part of that. It does in a
*  way suggest that there is the ability to run this kind of social cooperation and limiting game more
*  directly. Yeah, although the interesting part, it'll be, I mean, I guess China is kind of a test
*  case moving forward, because it's easiest for China to do that, right? Earlier on, the more
*  hierarchical, the more conformist people are, as that process begins to move along, and people are
*  becoming more individualistic and whatnot, the ability of the state to do that, to work through
*  elders, to rely on conformity and stuff will get trickier, although I guess technology could
*  compensate. I actually wanted to ask you about technology, because you've talked a lot here about
*  the ways in which cultural evolution can be set off and can run indirectly through religion and
*  other kinds of things that create a lot of human cooperation. But technology also seems to me to be
*  a force that certain technologies will emerge. I mean, the birth control pill is a very canonical
*  example here. But you can also think about the factory or air conditioning and all kinds of new
*  forms of cooperation, new settlement patterns, new family structures, new ways of structuring out the
*  life cycle begin to emerge from that. So how do you think about technology and technological change
*  within the context of cultural evolution? The first point is I agree that for sure technology
*  can have those kinds of effects. I think about technology as itself a product of cultural
*  evolution. The way social science kind of works, sometimes people want to put technology in its own
*  bin separate from culture. But it's very clear that people learn, if you just go to the smallest
*  scale human societies, people learn how to make the relevant tools from other members of their
*  community. This is passed on. If you look at the larger scale societies, people still have to learn
*  how to do whatever engineering stuff in the factories, making the tools from other people.
*  This could be passed along indirectly through books and things like that. But there's lots of
*  tacit knowledge that goes into even modern industrial production that has to be moved
*  from one crafts person or one engineer to the next. So it's all cultural transmission all the
*  way down. And one of the things I focus on the book is what are the conditions that lead to more rapid
*  technological change? So I have this idea of the collective brain, which is that the particular
*  institutions in a certain place and the psychology, trust in strangers, things like that, lack of
*  conformity will actually energize and create more rapid innovation. So at the end of the weirdest
*  people in the world, I'm trying to explain the industrial revolution. And why did you have this
*  explosion of new technologies, which did change things in the way you mentioned all at once,
*  beginning in the English Midlands and then spreading out from there.
*  And talk me through a little bit more your explanation for that.
*  Yeah. So my story is that most ideas are recombinations of existing ideas already
*  circulating in the cultural milieu. So the more diverse minds are able to interact and share ideas,
*  the more likely you are to create novel recombinations and lead to the diffusion of ideas.
*  I mean, even the famous geniuses like Einstein, if you look at special relativity,
*  it's a combination of a set of ideas that others were in the process of putting together. And he
*  just happened to be the first guy to really congeal them together. But this is true of lots of different
*  technologies. In a book I'm writing now, we actually have data from the complete US
*  patent database showing that nearly all patents are actually combinations of existing technologies.
*  So that seems to be the case. And then larger cities as a piece of evidence,
*  tend to produce more patents per capita. So more creativity per capita. And that's just the idea
*  that there are more people closer together. And it kind of makes everyone smarter. You're more likely
*  to bump into someone who has something useful that you put together with something else.
*  And then you're off and running things like, you know, the spread of Starbucks seems to energize
*  patenting, which is a surprising thing to a lot of people, because people had a third place
*  where people from different companies could come together, swap ideas, and you know, you can actually
*  look at the details of what the new patents are and see that happening. One thing that occurs
*  throughout some of the stories of the book is that a lot of these religious and cultural changes made
*  possible more migration and more migration made possible more mixing of ideas, more innovation,
*  you know, a lot of what we take for granted now in modernity. How do you think about migration
*  in the modern world? Is that something if you were kind of architecting societies for
*  more innovation and more cultural and more rapid cultural evolution that you would be trying to turn
*  up the dial on? Yeah, so and I have a big project on this. So we've combined the full complete US
*  census with a complete patent database. And what we're able to show is that migrant shocks to the
*  US by we can look at what counties they end up in. And then we can measure the diversity of those
*  counties by looking at last names as they appear in the census. And what we find is that what we're
*  calling socio-cultural diversity, which is this measure of last name variation, is a huge predictor
*  of patents in the coming decade. And immigrant shocks add richness to that diversity. So it's
*  just more evidence that immigrants have really driven a lot of innovation in the US. And we
*  wondered, we said, well, maybe immigrants, if you have too many, it will like cause problems. It might
*  cause problems, but we can't find any kink in the curve. This seems to be more immigrants,
*  more innovation. So we looked for like a hum shape, you might say maybe there's an optimal
*  number of immigrants, but it doesn't look like the US has hit that. And there's very interesting
*  papers done by Petra Moser and colleagues showing that when the US put in immigration quotas in 1924,
*  cutting out or limiting from certain populations, you got a decline in the groups in the in the
*  patenting domains that those groups had previously been attributing to. And it even meant that
*  Americans got less creative in those domains. So the immigrants are not just bringing in ideas
*  that make themselves rich. They're bringing in ideas that they're mixing with the native
*  borns and making everybody more creative. Speaking of county by county data, I know something you've
*  been working on is mapping within America, how psychologically weird again, on this one scale,
*  a county is against how it seems to be voting. And I know that research isn't out yet, but is
*  there anything preliminarily you are seeing in the data that's interesting? Yeah. So this begins with
*  a paper by my colleague, Ben Anke in economics at Harvard. And what Ben did was he went to this,
*  said there's a psychologist named John Height, who's been collecting data at your morals.org,
*  which you can go in there, you answer a bunch of questions and it kind of puts you on a place
*  within a five dimensional morality scheme. And those dimensions are cool, but to simplify things,
*  you can simplify this down to one big and most important dimension, which runs from moral
*  universalism, where people are seeing others as more or less equal, the sort of in-group,
*  out-group differences minimized. People care about a lot of harm and fairness, not so much about
*  hierarchy and loyalty and some of these other dimensions of morality. Down to the more parochial
*  end, where people have a smaller circle of cooperation and they're very concerned about
*  loyalties and hierarchy. So you get this spectrum and you can measure that at the U.S. county level,
*  because the data set is rich enough. And what Ben is able to show, and this is published in the top
*  econ journal, it's a very reliable result, a bunch of backup studies and stuff, is that counties that
*  were more morally parochial were more likely to vote for Donald Trump. And it was that vote total
*  over and above what Mitt Romney or John McCain got. So it's this sort of extra Trump boost
*  from being high on moral parochialism. And then so what we did is we, well, we wanted to know if that
*  would replicate for 2020, and that seemed to be the case there. And then we tried to explain the
*  variation. Okay, so there's this county level variation. And the first thing to note is that
*  if you plot from 2008 to 2019, what you see is a divergence. So the urban areas maintain, maybe they
*  go up a little bit in moral universalism, whereas the rural counties are going down the whole time,
*  declining in their moral universalism, getting more parochial. Okay, so we have temporal variation.
*  And then the question is, can we explain that? And the two factors that came out of our first
*  set of analyses is first shocks of any kind. So economic shocks seem to drive, make people more
*  morally parochial, and weather shocks. So climate change hits some US counties more than other US
*  counties. And if you get hit with a shock, hurricane, say, flood, fire, you get a bit more
*  morally parochial. And the final thing that seemed to matter, and this is not, we're not sure how to
*  deal with this, is that movement. Americans have been moving less and less, and they're staying put
*  more. But places that stayed disproportionately more, meaning most people stayed where they were
*  born, seem to also be more morally parochial. And that makes sense with this kind of distant
*  ties idea that you move to a new place and you got to like, make new friends and you create new
*  social networks. If you stay in the same place, you kind of establish long term family and friend
*  ties and whatnot. And that works towards more morally parochialism. So that could be related
*  to the economic shocks and stuff and the sort of directions of the causal hours there that's causing
*  us some challenges. One just obvious trend we seem to be seeing over the past hundred years,
*  past 50, I think, past 20, is that the world is getting weirder, right? This directionality seems
*  to be happening in a lot of places. Does that become a worrying monoculture at some point? I mean,
*  it was a dimension of cultural evolution. But if it becomes everywhere, do you get a situation where
*  there's not enough diversity, where as a species overindexed on individualism or something like
*  that? I mean, do you worry about the world getting too weird? Is it plausible the competitive
*  advantage will be going in the other direction, sort of like the Mormons in America? Do you see
*  something happening here where what's been a competitive advantage will become a disadvantage
*  or at least something that is more widespread than would probably be optimal? Yeah, this is a very
*  common question. And what's behind the question is that there's this linear trajectory that we've
*  been going on. And I guess I think that what I'm seeing, and I don't have any quantitative data to
*  offer you, but as what were European institutions like take universities or democratic government
*  has spread to all these different places, in some cases, it's a copy of the US Constitution
*  has spread widely. But then it has to interface with the existing local institutions. So if you
*  just take we were talking about China and Japan before, I think what's emerging there is somewhat
*  weirder psychology, but the societies are often also going off in new directions. So think of
*  something more complicated than a two dimensional line we're going along. So I mean, one dimensional
*  line, but rather there's there's different ways of going. So I don't think there's really a kind of
*  unilineal thing going on here. I think there's something more complicated going on. And what we
*  need to do is just do the more psychological work to really map the space of all the different
*  possibilities and see where things are going. To what degree, you know, if in China, there's some
*  capitalist type institutions, there's some free markets, but obviously, at the political level,
*  there's not democracy, but although at the lower level, there's democracy. So it's complicated,
*  and we haven't sorted it all out yet. Well, when you look on psychological surveys, how are people
*  differing when you say something sort of new is emerging? Are we able to see on the same surveys
*  where people are showing a different set of preferences or tendencies?
*  Yeah, I mean, so like one example that makes China challenging, and this kind of illustrates
*  the bigger problem is that if you ask people to generalize trust question, which is the survey,
*  they seem very trusting. But then if you ask the more detailed set of questions, you know,
*  do you trust foreigners? Do you trust people you met for the first time versus people who live
*  around you and you analyze those, they don't look like very trusting. So in, you know, in Australia,
*  in the US, if you ask people to generalize trust question, it goes along with it's correlated with
*  that in-group out-group trust I was describing, whereas in China, there are seem to be unrelated.
*  So it's as if life is structuring itself in a way so that most people you interact with you trust.
*  But if you ask me about foreigners, I don't trust those people. So that's a kind of more complicated
*  picture. And I haven't seen any analyses yet, the kind of look for the kind of multi dimensional
*  shape that we're that I'm talking about. I think that is a good place to come to an end. So always
*  a final question. What are three books you would recommend to the audience?
*  Well, let's see, I really like Why Europe by Michael Miterao, if you wanted to learn more
*  about Europe. I still think everybody should read Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel.
*  And I really like this book, A Chosen Few, how education shaped Jewish history, because it really
*  emphasizes how early changes in a religion of a particular group had big long term consequences.
