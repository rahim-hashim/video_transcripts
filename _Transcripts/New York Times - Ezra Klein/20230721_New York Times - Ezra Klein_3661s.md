# Barbara Kingsolver Thinks Urban Liberals Have It All Wrong on Appalachia
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [July 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsddxI0TZuc)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  So in 2023, the Pulitzer Prize for fiction was won by two novels, Trust by Hernan Diaz
*  and Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver.
*  And Kingsolver, I think, is a literary legend in her own time.
*  I mean, she wrote the bean trees, she wrote the poisonwood Bible.
*  She has won all kinds of prizes.
*  But I think it's fair to say Demon Copperhead is a kind of masterpiece.
*  And it's a kind of masterpiece she was trying to create.
*  She set out to write, as she tells me in this conversation, she was setting out to write
*  the great novel of Appalachia.
*  And I think she did.
*  This is a novel that is following loosely in the structure of David Copperfield by Dickens.
*  It's a novel set a little bit back in time.
*  I think that so much of our thinking now about this is political and places that go for Trump
*  and places that don't go for Trump.
*  But the novel set in the 90s and in the 2000s, so a little bit before some of the current
*  economic and political cleavages attain at least the form we know them in.
*  And it's a beautiful book.
*  It's a wrenching book.
*  It's a book that I routinely had to stop reading, because I was so fused with the character
*  and so fused with the story that when I could see something bad coming, I just couldn't
*  handle it before bed.
*  I just couldn't go through that with the main character.
*  So I mean, that I think is about as much as you can say for fiction when it almost feels
*  more real than the life you're living.
*  So I was grateful she was willing to come on the show and talk a bit about her life,
*  how she came to writing the novel, the sort of experiences she brought to it and the kind
*  of argument she's trying to have through it.
*  As always, my email is herclineshow.nytimes.com.
*  Barbara Kingsolver, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  So you've said that you're Appalachian through and through.
*  What does that mean to you?
*  I'm Appalachian.
*  And it's a funny thing.
*  It's a marker.
*  Appalachian means you say, I live in Appalachia.
*  It's a region that's a little hard to pin down on a map because it includes parts of
*  a lot of states starting from North Georgia, Eastern Tennessee, Western North Carolina
*  and Virginia up into the coal country of Kentucky and West Virginia and then up into sort of
*  the ridge country of Pennsylvania.
*  So that sounds complicated.
*  But to us, it is a whole place.
*  We're more connected with each other culturally and geographically than we are with the far
*  ends of our own states.
*  It's a place and it's a mindset.
*  We are connected by our mountains, our economies and the fact that for a couple of centuries,
*  we have been treated almost like an internal colony of the U.S.
*  We have suffered the exploitation of extractive industries managed by and profited from outside
*  companies that come in and take what they can and leave a mess.
*  So it started out with the timber industry, then it was coal, and then it was tobacco.
*  And now the latest car in this coal train of exploitations has been the opioid epidemic,
*  which was again quite deliberately perpetrated on us as a vulnerable population.
*  We're going to come back very much to the opioid epidemic.
*  But before we do, I want to talk a bit about just your geographic history because you grew
*  up in Kentucky, but then moved to the Congo.
*  Tell me a bit about the various places you've lived and why and what it was like coming
*  back then later in life.
*  Okay.
*  I grew up in the eastern part of Kentucky, sort of the foothills of Appalachia, and that
*  was really my home for my whole sort of schooling years up until I was 18 and left because of
*  a sort of a very unusual history.
*  My dad was a physician who was dedicated to serving.
*  Well, he was from poverty.
*  He was the first person in his family to go to get higher education.
*  And he was determined after he became a doctor to serve people who really needed a doctor.
*  And so for most of that time, that meant the rural parts of Kentucky where he'd grown up,
*  one of the more economically sort of depressed parts of the U.S.
*  But from time to time, he would get invitations from his colleagues to go to places where
*  people needed a physician even more.
*  And so that took us to the Congo, to rural Congo for about a year of my life.
*  I call it the what I did instead of second grade.
*  And a few other places once stint in the Caribbean.
*  So those were kind of adventures in my childhood, but we always came back to Kentucky.
*  So I still consider myself a Kentuckian, but I was the one among my classmates who had
*  lived on another continent.
*  I mean, most of my classmates, you know, never left the county.
*  So it did sort of distinguish me.
*  I was a person who had seen the world.
*  And maybe because of that, I had a sense of the world and then I wanted to see it on my
*  own terms.
*  So when I was 18, I went to college in the exotic faraway land of Indiana.
*  And I was lucky to do it.
*  Very few of us in Nicholas County High School ever went to college.
*  That was a really rare thing.
*  Nobody in my school was telling me you need to take these things called SATs.
*  Nobody was advising me.
*  I just kind of clawed my way into a scholarship and I got to Indiana, DePaul University, and
*  to my amazement, there I discovered I was a hillbilly.
*  I never thought of myself as a backward, coming from a backward place.
*  But oh my goodness, I needed only to cross the river into Indiana to discover, you know,
*  what ignorant backward folk we were from Kentucky.
*  And people laughed at my accent.
*  People actually, it was, I was a curiosity on campus.
*  People I didn't know would come over to me in the dining hall and say, say this, you
*  know, say this, well, what's this?
*  Like they wanted to hear me say syrup and mayonnaise and these other words that they
*  thought were, you know, hilariously charming.
*  And so I set about slowly, not even that intentionally, altering my persona in the
*  world, erasing my Kentucky-ian affect, just so that people would hear my words instead
*  of making fun of them.
*  And so now I've tried to become this imaginary cosmopolitan person.
*  I mean, I always wrote.
*  I just didn't think that I could be a writer, but that was an important and really dark
*  phase of my own writing.
*  I tried to write from that place of this imaginary cosmopolitan Barbara.
*  And it was just the most ridiculous, fakie nonsense you've ever read.
*  And then to fast forward a little bit here, you lived as an adult in Arizona for quite
*  some time and then moved back in the 2000s, I believe to Virginia, to where you live now.
*  And I always thought of you, I think, because I read you in that period as a writer in Arizona,
*  but now I sort of understand more of the complexity of it.
*  So tell me about the decision to move from Arizona back to Virginia.
*  It was all a part of the sort of my, my exodus from Kentucky was driven by what I think drives
*  most small town kids.
*  You know, we want to kick the little town dust from our shoes and go see the world.
*  If we're lucky enough or fierce enough or resourceful, we do that.
*  And after college, I actually backpacked around Europe for several years doing the low paying
*  jobs that you can do as an expat living out of a backpack.
*  And I really wasn't sure I wanted to come home, whatever home was.
*  But I had to because of visa problems in the late seventies, I lost my work visa.
*  So I had to come back to the US and just decided to try out Tucson, Arizona, because I wanted
*  to see the West.
*  And that seemed the next step in my exploration of the big world.
*  And I didn't really plan to stay in Tucson, but things happen.
*  You know, when you're at that stage in your mid twenties, you get a job and then you get
*  a little better job and then you meet somebody and then you have a house and then you have
*  a kid.
*  I went to grad school and next thing I knew I was really pretty settled in Tucson.
*  It didn't feel like home.
*  Not really.
*  No place I'd ever lived outside of Kentucky felt like home.
*  There were things I really loved about Paris and Athens and rural northern France.
*  And there were things I really loved about Tucson, but it never felt to me like the desert
*  wanted me there.
*  I missed towering green trees and mossy creeks and the sound of crickets at night and birds
*  in the morning.
*  It never felt right and I ached to come home, whatever home was.
*  Then after grad school, I began working as a freelance writer and I was working as a
*  journalist and so I learned a lot about the territory and I was trying to write a Southwestern
*  novel and then I had this epiphany.
*  Someone actually gave me Bobby Ann Mason's short story collection, Shiloh and Other Stories,
*  which was a very big book that year in the world.
*  She's from Kentucky.
*  That book broke out that year with a lot of praise from the American literati.
*  And I read it and I was amazed because it was people who talked like me and who worked
*  at Walmart.
*  You know, there were cashiers and they did shift work and they were working class Kentuckians
*  and the scales fell from my eyes.
*  I understood that I had been holding my light under a bushel, that my own voice could be
*  something that people might want to hear.
*  And so then I did a deep dive back into these Kentucky writers I had known but needed to
*  reread with new respect.
*  Wendell Berry, Robert Penn Warren, poets, James Still, Harriet Arnott.
*  And I re, it's not exactly a recovery, it's more like a reacquaintance with an embracing
*  of my own Kentucky voice.
*  And I found this voice and I named her Taylor Greer and I put her in charge of telling this
*  Arizona novel.
*  She was a character who came from Kentucky, moved to Arizona.
*  She did not have my life.
*  It's not autobiographical, but I knew her voice and her story and her mannerisms and
*  everything and I put her in Tucson, Arizona and she told the story and that was the Bean
*  Trees.
*  It was the first fiction that I wrote that was successful because I had decided to own
*  myself my Appalachian background.
*  This book has a lot of that dynamic to it and one thing that is threaded through it
*  is Demon, the narrator.
*  Dancing, the pride he feels in the place he comes from and the shame he feels or the
*  shame he has been told to feel in the place he comes from.
*  And you've talked in interviews about having internalized the shame of your upbringing
*  of where you come from.
*  What is that shame?
*  Well, this place where I live just over the mountains from Kentucky in Southwestern Virginia
*  is a perfect home.
*  And it's just exactly where I want to be among people I want to be to be with and to claim
*  as my own and as my neighbors.
*  So here I am as an Appalachian writer and it was finally with Demon Copperhead that
*  I could tell the most Appalachian story I've ever told.
*  I really, I know this probably sounds ridiculous, but I wanted to write the great Appalachian
*  novel.
*  I wanted this novel to hold the entire story, the whole background of why, why it is we
*  are who we are, all of the things that people look down on, sort of how they are not our
*  fault, how they were perpetrated against us as sort of an economic program exploiting
*  us and also all of the good stuff that we are people made of community, that we are
*  the most resourceful Americans you're probably going to find anywhere.
*  So what is that shame that I had internalized?
*  Well, look, it wasn't just in college.
*  It was everywhere.
*  Just about every time you speak with someone who is from outside of your region, they make
*  some remark like, ah, you seem really educated for a Kentuckian or more crudely, you're wearing
*  shoes.
*  I'm not kidding.
*  Or more subtly, are there any people there you want to be friends with in MAGA country?
*  How many people, well-meaning people have asked me how can I live there in the middle
*  of nowhere?
*  People, this is my everywhere.
*  This is my everything.
*  I live on a farm that grows food where water comes out of the mountain among trees that
*  make oxygen.
*  City folks are depending on us for a lot of things that they routinely discount or make
*  fun of.
*  It's been a very long program in the development of the world that economies and governments
*  have urged people into the cities away from the countryside, try to get land-based people
*  into the cities because there are a lot of reasons, but it boils down to this.
*  People in the money economy can be taxed.
*  People in a land economy produce a lot of what they consume on the spot.
*  So if you're growing your own food and eating it, there's no way to pull taxes out of that.
*  So I know this sounds really simplified, but it is the bottom line.
*  And I can point you to points in history where this has become overtly an issue.
*  The whiskey rebellion.
*  George Washington marched the whole army into Appalachia because people were making whiskey
*  and the government wanted to tax it.
*  Well, there's no money changing hands, so you can't.
*  And that was the reason for a war.
*  It feels like an impossibly simple thing, but if you look at all the ways that rural
*  people are stigmatized, it comes down to their self-sufficiency that's being mocked.
*  If you look at the cartoon Hillbilly, he's got a fish and pole, that's food self-sufficiency.
*  He's got the jug with the XXX on it that is alcohol self-sufficiency and he's got a straw
*  hat on, that's because he's a farmer.
*  It's all about what he's making and consuming himself.
*  It's so insidious, people don't realize it, but this long, long-term brainwashing has
*  resulted in a widespread notion that city people have got it.
*  City people are the, you know, sort of the advanced form of humans and rural people are
*  this sort of having this provisional existence.
*  They just haven't made it yet into the real life.
*  And so everybody looks down on the country people and the country people sort of absorb
*  that.
*  They can't help but absorb it.
*  So when I set out to write my great Appalachian novel, I was paralyzed with self-doubt because,
*  I mean, my starting point was that I wanted to write about the opioid epidemic, which
*  has become a huge assault on our culture, our families, our communities.
*  It's devastated so many of the good things about this region that we value and that we
*  love.
*  And so I wanted to write about these kids who've been damaged and this place that's
*  been damaged.
*  And it seemed like a really hopelessly sad story.
*  Plus, it's about people that I didn't feel the outer world cared about.
*  And so I just really, I spent a couple of years walking around and around this story,
*  trying to figure out how to break into that house because I really felt sure nobody wants
*  to read it.
*  I think there's so much power in that.
*  And it's something I was thinking about a lot during the book.
*  And let me try to see if I can hold two things in tension here because everything you say
*  is true.
*  And I think your point about the ways in which people from rural areas are visually stereotyped,
*  having a lot to do self-sufficiency is true.
*  And this is something that I'll be honest, sometimes I think grates on us city dwellers.
*  So I come from a people who over and over again were driven out of land.
*  I come from Jews driven by pogroms again and again off of land where they could have been
*  self-sufficient and into cities, into one city and then into another city and then into
*  another city.
*  Part of my family comes to America by way of Brazil.
*  Another family comes by way of Eastern Europe.
*  And there has always been this tension, I think broadly, it particularly afflicts Jews,
*  right?
*  The sort of rootless cosmopolitan stereotype.
*  But then there's also this side thread in America, I won't speak for it in other countries,
*  of, oh, the city dwellers aren't real Americans.
*  They're not on the land.
*  What they do isn't real work.
*  You know, I remember George W. Bush winning the election in 2004.
*  Oh, Democrats have lost the heartland.
*  There's a part of this country that is its real heart.
*  And the other parts, they're not real.
*  You're not a real American.
*  You're something else.
*  I think all the contempt you talk about is real.
*  And yet it also does in this strange way go the other way.
*  And maybe that is a kind of cliche, a kind of pat on the back where your economy is destroyed.
*  But oh, you're a real American.
*  But there is something I always think about when I hear this.
*  And it has never felt to me that the contempt actually only goes one way.
*  As a Jewish urbanite, I have definitely often felt that it is very easy for people in all
*  parts of American politics, but I've mostly heard it on the right, to talk about cities
*  and talk about people like me and with my history as if they are completely alien to
*  this place.
*  You're absolutely right.
*  It's a dialectic.
*  It's an antagonism.
*  It's like there's no point in asking who started this because it's a really, really old antagonism.
*  And you know, I was just kind of talking about a larger framework of development that has
*  really tried to get people off of the land.
*  But here we are in the middle of it with a lot of rock throwing in both directions.
*  And it's become devastating for American politics because, you know, rural people who are less
*  frequently called heartland as called flyover country, it's a sort of self-defense saying,
*  well, they hate us, we hate them back.
*  And let's talk about kind of who gets seen and who gets to tell the story in the US.
*  I think that's probably what's most critical right now is that all of our entertainment,
*  our news media, it's all made in cities.
*  And I think this has left rural people feeling so unseen and their problems so trivialized
*  or ignored that they've gotten vulnerable to a damaged extent so that they're ready
*  to vote for the person who comes along and says, look, I see you and I'm going to blow
*  up the system.
*  Okay, not the right answer, not the right guy.
*  But I understand why so many people for the first time felt like for the first time in
*  many election cycles, somebody was paying attention.
*  And now we've got a mess because that sort of validated this urban notion that those
*  people are, they're voting against their own interests, they're not well educated,
*  so they can't make good choices, so we don't really need to listen to them, so we just hate them.
*  So it's worse than it's ever been in my life, this urban rural antipathy to the point where
*  conversations are really difficult to have, because we will only take information from
*  people we trust.
*  That's just human.
*  That's the animal we are.
*  We only listen to people that we feel like are on our side and going to look out for us.
*  So if you open a conversation with you bonehead, then that conversation is over.
*  And those are the only conversations that are happening now in a political arena, and
*  it's scary.
*  So this is something I feel like I can do in my small way as an Appalachian who has
*  also been lucky enough to have a higher education, and I can read a lot of stuff, and I've lived
*  in a lot of parts of the world, and I can come back to my home and see what's good about
*  it and what's challenging about it, and I can try to talk across this divide.
*  I mean, Demon Copperhead is my attempt to speak to people.
*  Well, it's doing two things.
*  I mean, I want it to be a window and a mirror, as they say books can be.
*  I wanted it to be a mirror for my people to feel seen, and that's been an amazing experience
*  to hear from kids in the foster care system, from teachers, from so many people in Demon's
*  Walk of Life saying, I never knew that anybody else could see how hard this is.
*  But at the same time, to let people from elsewhere understand the complexity of our lives here,
*  the nuance of Appalachian culture, the value of our communities, the whole ecosystems of
*  characters that we are, the bad and the good, and the ways that we take care of ourselves.
*  I wanted this book to be a conversation about that divide, and it is being read mostly by
*  people who are not from here.
*  So I'm sitting here in the epicenter of urban journalism at the New York Times.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Which has gotten much worse over time.
*  I mean, it used to be that you had much more geographic dispersion of the papers people
*  read, not so much the TV they consumed, but local radio stations were stronger, newspapers
*  were more regional or more local, and that is not gone, but is even weakened from when
*  I was a kid.
*  Oh, it's so nearly gone.
*  It's really scary to me.
*  Even in a place like California, where you still have the LA Times and the Chronicle
*  and others, I mean, the New York Times is the biggest paper in California.
*  It's based in New York.
*  And I was thinking about this for a bunch of different reasons, but one of the things
*  that even if you think, and I do think this, that then some of the quality of journalism
*  people get is better.
*  You can get amazing national and international journalism, which was much harder to get when
*  I was growing up.
*  But what even a great international paper can't do is create a sense of local identity
*  and pride.
*  When you are growing up somewhere that is not New York and you read the New York Times,
*  there is a function that regional media, that local media play that is not being played
*  for you, that I would be very different if I hadn't had when I was growing up.
*  Well, and identity aside, just the information.
*  Yes, just the information, of course.
*  And about maybe 2% of what we see and read about is about us.
*  So it's a void that's, you know, how do we address that?
*  It's really profoundly debilitating not to see yourself anywhere.
*  And we're aware of this in other, in terms of other, we've made huge strides just, you
*  know, in the last decade in terms of identity politics.
*  Yes, we understand people with disabilities need to see themselves in ads and in shows
*  and film.
*  We understand that people of color need to see themselves to feel validated.
*  Okay, rural people need to see ourselves too.
*  Farmers need to see ourselves too.
*  And we're not.
*  And so I hope it's understandable that we're really mad, that we're really tired of being
*  overlooked.
*  And the economic aid that goes to farmers really goes to factories, you know, industrial
*  farms that are producing soybeans and corn that are going into fast food.
*  And that's not helping people.
*  Another unique quality of Appalachia is that we're one of the last strongholds of small
*  family farms because of our topography, because in the mountains there's no flat land.
*  A farm might have like a half of acre of one acre that's flat and all the rest is too steep
*  to plow.
*  So we don't have the giant combines.
*  We don't have the giant wheat fields and tractors that look like they came out of Star Wars.
*  If we ever see farming on TV, it's that and that's not real people.
*  To us, that's not farming.
*  I want to move us into the universe of the book.
*  And there's a particular character who I think bridges a bunch of the conversations we're
*  having here, which is Tommy.
*  So can you tell me a bit about Tommy?
*  The ghost in the room here is Charles Dickens, because I owe him everything with respect
*  to this book.
*  Charles Dickens is the key I finally found to the door of that house of this novel.
*  When I decided to write this as a modern day David Copperfield, he gave me, I guess the
*  chutzpah to tell the story because people really liked his version of it.
*  And I thought that could surely help.
*  He gave me a Crackerjack plot and all these amazing characters.
*  He gave me Tommy, who was called Tommy in David Copperfield.
*  And I will say here, as the disclaimer I always make, you do not have to read David Copperfield
*  before or after you read Demon Copperhead.
*  It's not necessary at all.
*  There's not a test?
*  There's no test, no.
*  But I took David Copperfield as my template and I just laid my book right over it because
*  it worked so well.
*  And then of course I had to use some of the characters in other ways.
*  And Tommy, he was called Tommy Trattles in David Copperfield.
*  In my version he's called Tommy Waddles.
*  Everybody has a nickname here.
*  So Tommy, who's Demon's best friend in his first foster home, which is a horrible foster
*  home, is this farmer who uses foster kids as enslaved labor on his farm, basically.
*  He uses the money that he gets for being a foster home to pay off his farm taxes and
*  he uses the kids for free labor and he's really pretty horrible and he doesn't feed
*  them enough and that's really sad.
*  But these boys bond and Tommy's a sweet, sad character who makes the best of everything
*  but he knows he's never ever going to have a real foster home.
*  Nobody wants, he says, nobody wants the fat kids.
*  He's really big for his age, but he's a reader.
*  Demon is fascinated by the fact that Tommy brings home armloads of books from his school
*  library and he stashes them under the bed.
*  At night he tells Demon the plots of all the magic tree houses he's ever read and all the,
*  you know, he reads the boxcar kids.
*  So even though Demon is not himself a reader, he's introduced to, I guess, Tommy is the
*  first intellectual he's ever known.
*  And as they grow up in their own hard scrabble ways, they reconnect.
*  That's a Dickensian thing, the great Dickensian coincidences.
*  They run into each other a few years later in the pharmacy where Demon's picking up his
*  illicit drugs.
*  He runs into Tommy who's now working at a newspaper.
*  He's a janitor, but he's found a job and he works his way actually into the newspaper
*  business and he puts his education to good use being a copywriter for ads in the local
*  little newspaper, which was, you know, it's sad because those local little newspapers
*  hardly exist anymore, but I worked on one when I was in high school.
*  So I know how that all works, how you lay stuff out on the table with wax.
*  You cut them out and you lay the columns out.
*  And that was really fun to write about.
*  The whole place smells like hot wax.
*  And they form a partnership, actually, Demon and Tommy, that becomes Demon's extraordinary
*  way out of his situation or a part of it.
*  One thing he used Tommy to do really effectively, I thought, is talk about how even what might
*  seem like sympathetic coverage of Appalachia reads within.
*  So he gets very upset, for instance, over a headline that just says, rural dropout rates
*  on the rise, which seems like a pretty neutral headline.
*  So what does he hate about it?
*  What he hates about it is that's all anybody ever hears about us is the bad stuff.
*  And yeah, this is Tommy's education like me and like all of the kids in this book have
*  no idea how we are seen by outsiders.
*  We're just people.
*  These kids have never thought about being Appalachian.
*  And now that Tommy's working in a newspaper and he's seeing the headlines that come in
*  over the AP thing and he's working for this little town newspaper in Pennington Gap,
*  they're looking desperately for some syndicated stories that have relevance to the local area.
*  He's attending to this and he's seeing what's coming through.
*  He's dismayed that the only thing that outsiders ever seem interested in noticing is how
*  poor the place is, the dropout rates, the poverty rates, the unemployment rates.
*  What about the good stuff?
*  They're living all the good stuff, too.
*  You know, all the memos that look after every kid in the neighborhood, the fact that you
*  know who your neighbors are all the time and they're always going to be there for you
*  unless they're not. But that's important, too.
*  Demon tries to explain this in Demon Psychology.
*  This is what he knows. He says, look, everybody needs somebody to punch when they get mad
*  because this is all he's ever known.
*  So the stepdad punches his wife or his girlfriend.
*  The girlfriend punches the kid.
*  The kid has to go kick the dog.
*  Everybody needs somebody to look down on.
*  When Demon explains all this to Tommy about how everybody has to look down on somebody
*  and then has these conversations with Tommy about how much condescension, how they're
*  seen by the rest of the world, he says, well, we're the dog of America.
*  Now that Tommy's become aware of this, he sees it everywhere.
*  He sees the TV has a festival of stupid hillbilly movies, you know, Deliverance, whatever,
*  Hillbilly, Chainsaw Massacre or whatever it is.
*  Now that his eyes are open, he's seeing it everywhere and he gets really upset about
*  it because he's got this email girlfriend from Eastern Pennsylvania and he's afraid
*  to meet her because he says she's going to think I'm a stupid hillbilly and her whole
*  family is going to think we're stupid hillbillies.
*  So this becomes Tommy's quest to figure out how this happened and why.
*  And so that becomes, you know, this is a way for the reader to follow Tommy on this
*  quest to understand how this happened.
*  And so Tommy, as the nearest thing we have in this book to an intellectual, he reads
*  some social history and he figures it out.
*  And so it allows the reader of this novel, and this is just a tiny part of the book,
*  but there is a moment where the reader gets to learn about land based economies and money
*  based economies and Demon in his short stints of living in cities, visiting or living when
*  he's in rehab, he lives in Knoxville and he lives this and he gives you the story in Demon
*  Speak, you know, so he says there's country poor and there's city poor.
*  When you're in the country, at least you have food.
*  He says in the city, where are people even going to raise their tomatoes in Knoxville?
*  He feels the desperation of people who have no access to the fundamental needs like apples
*  and tomatoes. He has a job in the produce section of Walmart when the artificial rain
*  comes on every 15 minutes to keep the produce wet.
*  He says this is the closest thing people are ever going to see to rain on a real vegetable.
*  And he feels sad for them.
*  As you mentioned, Demon and Tommy meet in foster care and foster care makes up a lot
*  of the first half ish of the book.
*  And it's really, I mean, as somebody with young kids and it's hard to read and something
*  you're focusing on there is the way in which the opioid epidemic hasn't just harmed those
*  who have been killed or have ended up in rehab or struggling with addiction.
*  But how many children have simply lost parents?
*  Can you talk a bit about what you found when you were researching that or seeing it around
*  you and how you began to think about the scale of what it has done to children now?
*  Yeah, that was my point of entry into this novel.
*  That's what I really wanted to write about.
*  The orphans. It's a whole generation of kids.
*  The counties around where I live have enormous.
*  I can't give you exact statistics.
*  I've heard anything from 15 to 35 percent of kids in some of these counties who are
*  being raised by someone other than their parents because their parents are addicted or
*  incarcerated or dead.
*  We have a generation of orphans coming up through our schools.
*  Some of them have gone into foster care, but the system is so incredibly overloaded,
*  which you know, you learn about in the novel.
*  There's so many more kids in need than there are social networks to catch them.
*  But the caseworkers are so overloaded and so pathetically underpaid.
*  They make less than school teachers.
*  They don't make enough really to live.
*  These caseworkers.
*  The turnover is really rapid.
*  The files get lost.
*  These kids are just lost.
*  I didn't even know until I did more research into this.
*  That's where we are.
*  This is something that I think the world needs to know about.
*  This country voters need to know about.
*  We need to know how this epidemic has left a generation of innocence that nobody's
*  taking decent care of.
*  The story of the big players in the opioid epidemic, Purdue Pharma, the attorneys and
*  the DEA and all of that big story has broken and it's been told beautifully by a
*  handful of journalists have done a great job of cracking and telling us that story.
*  Beth Macy among them with her fantastic book, Dopesick.
*  So that was my point of entry in this novel.
*  The story I wanted to tell was not about the big guys, but about the little people.
*  These kids have been left behind.
*  Our burdened public school systems are being asked to raise these kids.
*  Our public schools are the point of delivery for pretty much all the social services
*  that these kids may get.
*  They get most of their food from free school lunches.
*  A lot of them are not getting fed at home.
*  They get their mental health care through the school system.
*  It's not the public school that delivers it, but county mental health agencies
*  deliver the care, the counseling they do is in the schools because they can't expect
*  families to take kids to counseling.
*  So this is a burden on our public school system and on our libraries and on everything
*  that we have here that nobody outside of this region is even aware of.
*  So we need resources, not just for treating addiction, which is an immense need, but
*  that's only one part of the damage.
*  A bigger part of the damage is what we do for these kids.
*  And so that's the story I wanted to tell.
*  I want to just tell the story of the orphans.
*  And that's why Dickens came calling and told me orphan stories can work.
*  Let me give you an idea.
*  You had a passage here that I found extraordinarily moving.
*  I mean, this is how Demon becomes an orphan, but also how he has to think about
*  and over his life has to process his mother and her relationship to him and what her
*  death meant in terms of her care for him.
*  So do you mind reading the passage on page 109, beginning with I had roads to travel?
*  Sure.
*  And this is at his mother's funeral, his mother overdosed on his birthday and he
*  couldn't help but feel pretty furious at his mom for this abandonment.
*  And now he's looking back because this narration, this first person narration is
*  told from the, it's a retrospective from later in his life, his, the advanced age
*  of maybe 25 or something.
*  So he says here, he kind of steps slightly outside of the funeral scene and says, I
*  had roads to travel before I would know.
*  It's not that simple.
*  The dope versus the person you love that a craving can ratchet itself up and up
*  inside a body and mind at the same time that body's strength for tolerating its
*  favorite drug goes down and down that the longer you've gone hurting between fixes,
*  the higher the odds that you'll reach too hard for the stars next time.
*  That big first rush of relief could be your last in the long run.
*  That's how I've come to picture mom at the end, reaching as hard as her little body
*  would stretch, trying to touch the blue sky, reaching for some peace and getting it.
*  If the grownup version of me could have one chance at walking backward into this
*  story, part of me wishes I could sit down on the back pew with that pissed off kid
*  in his overly tight church clothes and dark hawk attitude and tell him, you think
*  you're giant, but you are such a small speck in the screwed up world.
*  This is not about you.
*  You have a interesting way of putting his mother in context in this part of the book.
*  And you talk about her as a, the unknown soldier.
*  You talk about the way in which nobody cries over someone's bad personal decisions
*  or not nobody, but society does not cry over one person's weakness.
*  But then when they're a mountain of bodies, then a story is called for.
*  Then a narrative takes hold.
*  Then it's not their fault.
*  It becomes a societal force pressing down on them, but the people who fall at the
*  beginning, they don't get that grace, not publicly.
*  And even at that time, not in their own families, because it's in their own
*  families where these narratives have to take hold.
*  I'd like to just hear you talk a bit more about that, about how you thought about
*  the respect we do or don't give to people who end up addicted to or dying from
*  medications that they were given and told by people with medical degrees or people,
*  you know, who were there, the nurse and the doctor's clinic that this was safe
*  and somebody had checked this out for them.
*  Exactly.
*  That's the crime that this drug was so addicting and the doctors who prescribed
*  it were told otherwise, and this region was singled out as particularly vulnerable,
*  partly because healthcare delivery in rural places is stretched so thin that
*  there's very little opportunity for follow-up.
*  They often see people on the one sick day that that person has in a year from work.
*  So it's of necessity, it's prescription pad doctoring, and Purdue saw this as an
*  opportunity because there's so many people here with work injuries, old mining
*  injuries, disability, and so they just thought, aha, we can make a killing here.
*  And they literally did.
*  And to research this book, I spent time, I sat down with a lot of people who had
*  been through this whole journey to learn about sort of the inside of addiction in
*  ways that, you know, and just the logistics, like here's the pill, how does it
*  get into your veins, a lot of the specifics that I fortunately don't know from firsthand
*  experience.
*  So I listened to a lot of stories and I shed a lot of tears with people who told
*  me their stories of how they became addicted.
*  And most of them started with a legal prescription from a doctor they trusted,
*  a doctor who was going on the best advice, who said, you have to stay ahead of the
*  pain.
*  You set your clock.
*  You take this on whatever timetable you're supposed to take it.
*  Don't miss a pill.
*  Take this painkiller.
*  And by the end of their 30 day script, they were addicted.
*  And so this was done to them.
*  Nobody wants to be addicted.
*  But what I've found and what I thought so much about in the course of writing this
*  novel, I realized that was another of the prejudices I knew I was going to be up
*  against because people have such firm ideas of addiction as a moral failing, as
*  a failure of willpower, a failure of virtue.
*  And that's been done to us.
*  That's a brainwashing that, you know, the so-called war on drugs, which I think
*  hit its 50th anniversary this year, has been a whole lot of brainwashing on how
*  the answer to this problem is just say no.
*  The answer to this problem is incarceration.
*  We have been trained, culturally trained to think of addiction in this way as a
*  personal failing that needs to be punished.
*  And incarceration does not cure addiction any more than it cures cancer.
*  Addiction is a disease.
*  It's a disease of the brain, of dopamine and neurons in the brain that have been
*  damaged and rewired so that if you don't keep getting this drug, you get so sick
*  that you feel like you're going to die.
*  You wish you're going to die and you might die.
*  It's impossible to describe how terrible this disease is, not just the
*  dope sickness of it, but the fact that your entire life has to become just a
*  really difficult, hardworking process of every morning, getting your means, getting
*  your fix, getting through another day that no, nobody wants to live like that.
*  So one of my hopes with this novel is that by portraying this process of addiction
*  from the inside, people might have more compassion for it as a disease and think
*  of people with addiction as diseased.
*  I mean, even in our own families, you know, we see this, nobody would tell their
*  daughter with cancer, okay, I'm going to kick you out.
*  I'm going to wait till you hit bottom and then you can have chemo.
*  That's how we treat the disease of addiction.
*  And it's incredibly inhumane and effective treatment will only happen after
*  we switch over from, you know, putting this in the hands of the police and the
*  prisons to medical workers who can meet addicted people where they live and offer
*  them the first steps of clean needles and fentanyl test strips so that they won't
*  die in the weeks that it will take for them logistically, physically, emotionally
*  to get to the beginnings of treatment.
*  There's still a lot of people who have a sort of, I guess, a moral objection to
*  harm reduction centers that just give people the basics of clean needles and
*  fentanyl test strips to keep them alive.
*  It's as if people feel that addicted people deserve to die.
*  Imagine if we looked at any other disease that way.
*  One thing that I think you described really well here is that the desire, the
*  market, the demand for Oxycontin and for other kind of similar drugs in the
*  period was also an outcome of the kind of work we have people do in the kind of
*  lives we have them live.
*  You describe Oxycontin then as quote, God's gift for the laid off deep hole
*  man with his back and neck bones grinding like bags of gravel for the bent
*  over lady pulling double shifts at Dollar General with her shot knees and ADHD
*  grandkids to raise by herself.
*  And there is something, I mean, all addictions are a kind of horror, but
*  there's a literalness that is often a little bit obscured with other drugs.
*  I mean, this was a drug people got on to treat real pain and pain they often had
*  to go through because they were trying to make a living and, you know, being made
*  to do repetitive tasks that the human body is not built for.
*  And there is just a, both a, both a horror to that, but, but so much of this book,
*  both in the foreground at times, but in the background, a lot of times is about
*  the economics of the area.
*  And one of the economics of the area is the kind of work people have to do.
*  Exactly.
*  It was so predatory.
*  It was so intentional.
*  And we know this now that Purdue Pharma looked at metrics.
*  They looked all over the country to see where, you know, and identified, as I
*  understand it, three regions.
*  It was a combination of mining and a lot of physically taxing labor that left a lot
*  of people with disability and pain.
*  They're, they're using people's pain for profit.
*  So that was part one was to find these areas where a lot of people have live in
*  pain and have work injuries that have, they've carried for, in many cases,
*  decades.
*  And the other thing is, as I mentioned before, this very stretched thin healthcare
*  delivery system.
*  I think that one of many things that people in cities don't understand is how
*  hard it is for us to get to see doctors in the country.
*  The county where I live for many years did not have, it's a big county too.
*  We did not have one physician here who could deliver a baby.
*  Not one.
*  We had to go to Tennessee.
*  One of the characters in this novel, Dory, ends up having to quit school when her
*  father is sick.
*  Her mother is dead and her father is gravely ill and she has to drive to get him to
*  heart, lung specialists and the different doctors he has to see, you know, almost
*  every week.
*  She has to drive to another state.
*  That's the case.
*  I have driven with my kids to see specialists.
*  Many times I've driven to doctors who lived four or five hours away in the
*  nearest city.
*  This is something that's just that we live with here.
*  There are not enough physicians to meet our needs.
*  And so you have to wait a long time to get into one.
*  And that doctor doesn't have the chance to follow you up.
*  He's got one chance to help your, in this case, terrible pain.
*  And he's got this drug.
*  I mean, they knew this was going to work.
*  They knew that they would be able to pump into these counties in many cases, more
*  than one or two pills for every man, woman and child in the county.
*  I mean, the flow of these drugs into these counties in the very short time, the
*  relatively few years that it was allowed, sort of before the whistle blew, is
*  phenomenal.
*  And once that addiction has begun, it doesn't go away after the drug is
*  reformulated.
*  The next step is heroin.
*  One thing the book really emphasizes is both the protections and I would also say
*  the predations of community, something that is there in Lee County in the world of
*  the book.
*  I think, I think also in many ways in real life is a knowingness over and over again,
*  a demon running in the city.
*  And I think that's something that's really important to me.
*  In real life is a knowingness over and over again.
*  A demon runs into people from his past or finds that there is a connection to
*  somebody from his past.
*  And it's like, well, that's Lee County for you.
*  Everybody's connected to everybody.
*  And there's both these moments of incredible grace in that, in the story you
*  tell about him.
*  And then also I feel like this interesting dark side of it where he's preyed upon by
*  people in this community over and over again, are allowed to fall through the
*  cracks over and over again.
*  That the community is not able to be that protective.
*  And at times it's even the source of the danger.
*  So I'm curious how you thought about that, because it's clearly something that you
*  love about the place.
*  I mean, it comes through, but also something that you didn't allow that to be an easy
*  answer. And many of the worst things done to him are done to him, not by a far away
*  economic force, but somebody living right down the street.
*  I think that's so much of the damage that happens is because of the way that
*  community where he lives has become damaged and unraveled by the drug epidemic.
*  But just to back up and talk more generally about community, something that's sort of a
*  mantra for me in my teenage years, growing up in a real little town was the great thing
*  about community is everybody knows your business.
*  And the thing that sucks about community is everybody knows your business.
*  So if you're a teenager trying to do something that your parents don't know about, it's
*  not going to happen. They're going to know you're going to have a flat tire and the guy
*  that pulls up to help you is going to tell your dad within minutes.
*  If you make an enemy, you're going to run into him again.
*  It's a funny thing. And that's really Appalachian.
*  We are people made of community for better and for worse, but mostly I'm going to say
*  for better. You are your people.
*  And when you meet somebody new for the first time and you sit down with them, the first
*  conversation is always the same. I would title that conversation, Who are your people?
*  You sit down and you talk about like who you know, like who are you and what do you do?
*  And, and then you just keep talking until you find out that like your papa is related to
*  their second cousin or they worked together at one time, or you find that point of connection
*  and then you relax and then you have whatever other conversation you're going to have.
*  But that's just how it is. We don't even think about it.
*  We are just all aware of how we're related to each other.
*  And for the most part, that's a rare and beautiful thing.
*  I think especially in the United States of America, which has become since World War II
*  so mobile that it's very common for people to live in communities where they're not related to
*  anybody. We know everybody, we live among our people and families function.
*  When a family member gets taken out, there's a larger family to absorb up to a point.
*  It really, it really works well. It's sort of our own, another level of our self-sufficiency.
*  You know, when there's, when somebody dies, everybody brings food.
*  You know your neighbors, you look everybody in the eye.
*  You wet when you drive down the road, there's this way of waving that people put one finger
*  up from the steering wheel. It's like everybody waves at everybody.
*  And this comes through in the novel when demon goes to the city and he feels like an alien.
*  He feels invisible because nobody looks him in the eye.
*  Nobody waves to him. Nobody looks at anybody.
*  And his friend there who's a city guy says, well, they're saving their juice.
*  You got to save your juice. You can't just give it away to everybody because you have to save it
*  for your own people. And if you gave it away to everybody, you saw it, you'd be done with your
*  juice by nine o'clock in the morning. And so demon ponders this and he realizes we in Appalachia are
*  the juice economy. I mean, we, we give ourselves to everybody. We, you know, ladies get together on
*  front porches and they make quilts to give to the girls in high school that are pregnant.
*  That's a real thing. You know, ladies get together and make sack dinners to give to the
*  kids at school that are going to go home for the weekend and not have any dinner.
*  It is how I think we have adapted to these centuries of, of exploitation from the outside,
*  just taking care of ourselves. And that's Mrs. Paget in the novel who looks after demon and
*  knows more than he realizes about his situation, but it can only get you so far when you have
*  something like, you know, on the level of this addiction crisis, cutting through whole generations
*  of families, taking out so many people and also putting so many people in a position
*  that they have to steal to live. It's the most tragic part of the whole story. I think is what
*  it has done to communities. You talked about, and you mentioned earlier, feeling like a bit
*  of an ambassador between worlds here and this book in particular, being a way of explaining
*  where you come from and where you live to people who are in a very different world,
*  who are picking up the latest Pulitzer prize winner in fiction at the bookstore.
*  If you were doing the ambassador dumb in the other way, in the other direction,
*  trying to communicate what's beautiful about cities, about some of these other parts of America
*  to the people you live with or to the people you're describing in this book,
*  what would you emphasize in the way that you emphasize community going in the current direction?
*  I would talk about the value of the richness and the privilege of living among many people who are
*  very, very different from you, who aren't related to you, who come from a different country. I mean,
*  I just think about for years and years until she died, when I ever came to New York City,
*  I stayed with my agent, Frances Golden, in her apartment on East 11th Street. I just think about
*  that part of New York City, the Lower East Side, and how I would just walk down the street and
*  hear people speaking different languages and pass the Italian place and the Polish place.
*  All of the world is there, and how much you can absorb from people who are not like you, who are
*  white and not white, people of color, people of so many colors, people of so many orientations,
*  people who are gay and straight and trans, and acceptance and comfort with difference comes with
*  proximity. That's something that's hard for us here because just as a product of history of the
*  settlement of this region and the fact that there was really no good reason after it was settled
*  mainly by the Scots-Irish, there was no good reason. There were no employment opportunities
*  or other reasons for people from outside, from other countries, people who are not white to come
*  here. So here we are. There's a whole lot more diversity in Appalachia than outsiders may think.
*  We aren't a dull monoculture, but it's also possible to go to school, and it's usual to go
*  to school with people who are mostly like you, mostly your race and your class and your caste.
*  And so one good thing about what kids get and what adults get from television is exposure to
*  people who are different, but that's not the same as having a friend who's different from you. And
*  so that's something that I wish we had more of here. I think it's a lovely place to end. So
*  always our final question on the show. What are three books that have influenced you that you
*  would recommend to the audience? I would choose two books that are Appalachian about my place.
*  One of them is by Arwen Donahue. The full title is Landings, a Crooked Creek Farm Year.
*  And it's, I love this book. It's a graphic memoir. It's not like most books you're going to see.
*  She's an artist. So this book is a memoir of her year on her farm, which is in the county where
*  I grew up. And every page is on the left-hand side, a pen and ink watercolor drawing of a scene
*  of a day of a life in her farm. And it's paired with really lovely prose that just describes
*  their year on their small farm, growing vegetables for a farmer's market. And I said earlier that
*  it's really rare to see descriptions of farming that are not either condescending or romanticized.
*  This is neither. This is real. It's just a real look at what life is like for a family that's very
*  attached to a piece of land and making their living from it. I recommend Beth Macy's follow-up to Dopesick,
*  which is called Raising Lazarus. It's a great piece of journalism on where we are now with this
*  epidemic and what can be done, what's being done, and what we need to do more of. And then the third
*  is a novel I just read that knocked my socks off, and it's nothing to do with where I live.
*  It's actually set entirely in the ocean. It's called Pod by Laleen Paul, and it's set entirely
*  in the ocean. It's not science fiction. It's realistic. It's set in the here and now, and
*  none of the characters are human. I'll just tell you that. And it's fascinating.
