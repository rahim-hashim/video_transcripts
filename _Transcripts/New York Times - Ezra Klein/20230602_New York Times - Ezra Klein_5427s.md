# Fareed Zakaria on Where Russia’s War in Ukraine Stands — and Much More
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [June 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkgFCvSmD-w)
*  Russia invaded Ukraine 15 months ago.
*  For a time following the invasion, it was all the world could talk about.
*  It was all the show could talk about.
*  And now, as happens with a lot of stories huge at their outset, now the Russian-Ukraine
*  war is treated as one news story.
*  I mean, a major one, but one news story among many.
*  But it's still more than that.
*  It's a kind of hyper story.
*  There is the conflict itself, which matters enormously.
*  And then there's a way it's reshaping global geopolitics and the relationships and balancing
*  of the great powers.
*  Early in the invasion, I had Fareed Zakaria on to talk about the way it felt at that moment,
*  like we were re-entering an age of great power conflict.
*  So I wanted to have him back on now to discuss where the war is now, what the prospects and
*  possibilities of its end might be, and how it's changed the relationships and competition
*  between America and Europe and China and India, among others.
*  Zakaria, of course, is host of the CNN show Fareed Zakaria GPS.
*  He's a columnist for The Washington Post and the author of many, many books, including
*  most recently Ten Lessons for a Post-Pandemic World.
*  As always, my email for guest suggestions, thoughts, et cetera, Ezra Klein show at nytimes.com.
*  Fareed Zakaria, welcome back to the show.
*  Always a pleasure, Ezra.
*  So we last talked on the show in March 2022.
*  This was right after Russia invaded Ukraine.
*  So give me your overview of where that conflict stands now.
*  I think I said this to you the last time, but it's worth pointing out that what this
*  represents is two things, the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
*  First, it is the most frontal challenge to the post-Cold War world order created sort
*  of serendipitously and partly by design by the United States, largely after the collapse
*  of communism.
*  At that point, one of the things that was settled was the post-Soviet space.
*  What Putin is in a sense doing is this is sort of buyer's remorse on the part of the
*  Russians.
*  They were weak in the mid 1990s, amazingly weak.
*  The Russian economy had contracted by 50% between 1990 and 1996.
*  That's more than it had contracted during World War II.
*  Russia at a moment of weakness felt it gave up too much and is trying to, in a sense,
*  claw back a piece of that, regardless of the fact that it violates international law, treaties
*  that it signed, norms that have been established since 1945.
*  Relatedly, it is the sort of last gasp of the last multinational empire in the world.
*  If you think about it, this is not so uncommon in terms of buyer's remorse, in terms of
*  empires not wanting to let go of what they see as defining their core colonies that,
*  in a sense, define who they are.
*  The Ukrainians don't want to be part of Russia's empire.
*  If there's one trend line you see over the last hundred years, it's nationalism.
*  It's the power of people once they have decided that they want to live free.
*  That is an unstoppable force, and that is what Russia is against.
*  I think the rest of it is honestly commentary in the sense that there will be day-to-day
*  ups and downs and the Russians will do well one month and the Ukrainians will do well
*  one month.
*  But I think the secular trajectory is that Ukraine is going to be an independent nation.
*  It felt to me, and tell me if you think this is wrong, that I was hearing more about possible
*  shapes of end games, of resolutions, of settlements a year ago than I am now.
*  There's a strange sense in which people seem to have settled in to a long, protracted war
*  of attrition.
*  Do you think that's right?
*  Is that what you feel in the commentary?
*  Yeah, I think you're exactly right.
*  I think it's probably for a few reasons.
*  One is what we've realized is that neither side is strong enough to completely prevail,
*  end this very quickly, yet neither side is so weak that they feel the need to capitulate.
*  That creates this dynamic where, as you say, it feels like this is going to be a long struggle.
*  I think it's also fair to say what we have been surprised by is the absolutely implacable
*  nature of Ukrainian nationalism.
*  People have realized, look, the Ukrainians are not going to give up.
*  They are not going to give up easily.
*  They're not going to settle for something that doesn't feel like they have essentially
*  maintained their independence.
*  They've surprised on the battlefield, on the upside.
*  You put all that together and I think you have a scenario where everyone is waiting
*  for this Ukrainian counteroffensive.
*  My guess is, as many people are saying, it will surprise on the upside as they have in
*  the past, but I suspect it will not win the war.
*  Therefore, by the end of this year, you may begin to see a return to some of those conversations.
*  Because the conflict has become so dark, the Russians have done things that are really
*  extraordinary, bombing civilian facilities and water treatment plants and hospitals.
*  It's difficult to imagine how these two sides come to an agreement, a settlement, recognize
*  each other.
*  I think this ends more like the Korean War, which technically hasn't ended.
*  It just is the two sides stop fighting.
*  There is a demilitarized zone between the two armies, which is exactly why it's called
*  the DMZ, but there's never a peace treaty signed.
*  One dimension of the war that you hear, again, less about now than you did a year ago is
*  the grip the Western sanctions have on the Russian economy.
*  And early on, there was a sense that these were unexpectedly punishing.
*  They began, the sense was they were maybe mild, then very quickly as Ukraine showed
*  a ferocious level of resistance, they ramped up.
*  Now we were choking them off in the financial sector.
*  There's certainly a sense that Russia is managing to limp along without the kind of punishing
*  depression that would really put a lot of pressure on Putin.
*  I have two questions on this, but the first is why are the sanctions underperforming?
*  It's a great question, and there are two reasons, I think.
*  The first is we designed the sanctions so that Russia could continue to export energy.
*  Russia could continue to sell oil and natural gas and also sells a lot of coal.
*  And the reason is if Russian oil, natural gas and coal were completely shut out of the
*  world markets, it would trigger a global recession.
*  Oil would go to $200 a barrel because all that Russian supply taken out of the market
*  would mean that demand would vastly exceed supply.
*  You would suddenly have huge price spikes.
*  Much of the developed world would go into a recession, maybe even worse.
*  So we designed the sanctions to sort of force the Russians to have to sell at a discount,
*  sell a bit less than they could make.
*  So they're getting a lot of revenue.
*  Russia is a huge exporter of energy, perhaps the world's largest, depending on how you
*  count it.
*  So that's one part of it, which is an inevitable reality about Russia's role in the world economy
*  and in the energy economy.
*  The second, and I think this is the more unusual one, is there's a big world economy out there
*  now.
*  We, I think, still have in our heads the idea that if the United States and Europe and Japan
*  cut you off from the world economy, you're done.
*  But it turns out about 50% of the world economy is now the so-called emerging markets, and
*  they're not abiding by the sanctions.
*  So the reports I'm getting from Russia are that, for example, Starbucks has left, as
*  did a thousand Western companies.
*  But if you go to Russia and you go to the corner store where Starbucks was, there's
*  a coffee shop there.
*  It's called Star Coffee.
*  It's owned by Russians.
*  They sell coffee for about the same price.
*  I don't know if it's as good or bad.
*  But many of those abandoned Western businesses have been taken over by Turkish businesses,
*  Chinese businesses, Russian-owned businesses.
*  So there's a whole rest of the world economy out there that is still playing with Russia.
*  In fact, there's some concern that the Russians are essentially evading the sanctions by importing
*  things through Turkey, for example.
*  The Turks buy something from the West.
*  The Russians buy that same thing from Turkey.
*  How do you prevent that?
*  All that said, the piece that has been very effective is the freezing of the central bank
*  reserves and the denial of technology.
*  It is absolutely clear that Russia is crippled by the lack of access to Western technology.
*  At the very high end, particularly of the digital economy, high-end computer chips,
*  for example, it is a remarkably narrow funnel.
*  Basically getting the stuff from three or four companies that do chip design, one company
*  that does chip manufacturing, ASML in Holland, and all those are essentially in the West
*  Plus, what I call the West Plus, meaning the West Plus, Japan, South Korea, Singapore.
*  And so the hope, I think, of the West at a certain point was that these sanctions were
*  going to be tight enough that Russia, if it couldn't win quickly, it would not want to
*  hold on slowly.
*  Again, my sense is that's not coming true.
*  The sanctions are tough on them.
*  They're degrading their military, which is, I think, often an undernoticed important dimension
*  of the sanctions.
*  But the idea that they're going to constrict enough to force Russia into settlement because
*  they can't have this happen to them for three or four or five years, I don't get the sense
*  people are still optimistic about that.
*  Yeah, I think that this is one of the biggest flaws in the way we conduct international
*  affairs ever since the end of the Cold War, which is we want to do something.
*  We either don't want to make the commitment or we can't make the commitment or it's too
*  expensive or whatever to make the commitment to do something very dramatic like military
*  action.
*  And so we do sanctions.
*  And they very rarely work in the sense that the regime in question changes its policy.
*  In some cases, the sanctions are almost designed, even if not explicitly, to change the regime.
*  And that certainly doesn't happen.
*  We need to focus a little bit more on that central conundrum, which is sanctions tend
*  to empower the regime in place.
*  Look at what the Iran sanctions have done.
*  They have empowered the most conservative elements of Iran, the Revolutionary Guard,
*  because they're the guys that do all the smuggling.
*  They're the guys that have now control the key choke points which allow selective foreign
*  goods in through kind of medical exemptions or educational exemptions or whatever it is.
*  It's all the state.
*  So you in a sense empower the state and you disempower society, which are the broad forces
*  that would be empowered by commerce, contact, capitalism.
*  And that dilemma proves to be very powerful.
*  Look, there's a famous story of Fidel Castro saying, I think bizarrely to Sean Penn, that
*  if the Americans were to take the sanctions off, he would clamor for their reinstatement.
*  The implication being the sanctions is what gives him a lot of his power and legitimacy
*  that he's standing up to the Americans.
*  Look at Venezuela.
*  The sanctions still haven't worked.
*  Look at Iran.
*  They haven't worked.
*  So we're trying it with Russia.
*  I actually support the sanctions in Russia because they do put pressure on the regime.
*  But you're not going to change Putin's calculus.
*  The only thing that can change Putin's calculus is defeat on the battlefield.
*  And so in my mind, more important than the sanctions are give the Ukrainians all the
*  weapons they need, give them all the training they need, do it fast and allow them to win
*  on the battlefield because historically, that's when countries do change course when they're
*  bleeding soldiers and money on the battlefield.
*  So you predicted where I was going to go.
*  There's what we don't give Russia and what we do give Ukraine.
*  And we've drawn all kinds of lines and lines that have been moving about what we will and
*  won't give Ukraine in terms of armaments.
*  They want more advanced technology, better fighter jets, et cetera.
*  And we have consistently given them some of what they want and not all of what they want.
*  How would you describe the lines we've drawn, why we drew them there, and whether drawing
*  them there was wise?
*  So the administration is juggling something difficult and I think they're handling it
*  pretty well, which is you're trying to do two things.
*  You're trying to support the Ukrainians, make sure that they have a tactical and strategic
*  advantage as much as possible, make sure they have a kind of almost inexhaustible supply
*  of things like ammunition and money.
*  And the United States has by far been the most generous on both.
*  But at the same time, you're trying not to trigger a conflict between Russia and NATO,
*  between Russia, therefore, and the United States.
*  This was a line we tried to tread very carefully during the Cold War.
*  That's why there were so many proxy wars in Central America and Southeast Asia, because
*  the superpowers did not want to engage directly for fear that that could lead to an inevitable
*  nuclear escalation.
*  I think that's a legitimate concern.
*  I think the Biden people are thinking through that through seriously.
*  And so some of the lines are they're telling the Ukrainians, please do not use American
*  weapons or use NATO weapons to attack Russia itself, attack Russian forces in Ukraine so
*  that you are effectively repelling the invasion rather than invading Russia yourself.
*  Obviously, the line is not perfect, but I think that's a very sensible line.
*  Separately, there's the issue of how much can the Ukrainian army absorb?
*  If you talk to people in Washington, and these are people who I think are trying to do the
*  right thing, they argue, look, there's a limit to how fast the Ukrainians can learn to use
*  the most sophisticated American weaponry, such as our advanced fighter jets, such as
*  our best tank.
*  And it does make some sense to make sure that those weapons are going to be used effectively
*  before you give them.
*  So on the whole, I am not one of those people who thinks the Biden administration has been
*  too slow, too little, too late.
*  They're trying to do it in a serious, responsible way.
*  Could it be 10, 15 percent faster?
*  Maybe, I don't know.
*  But I think in general, they're trying to balance the situation and have been doing
*  it pretty well.
*  When I listen to what Ukrainian political leaders and war leaders are saying, though,
*  the absolutely consistent, never-ending message is that they are not getting enough.
*  So I take it that Washington says they're doing plenty, but it's also true that we've
*  been changing what we're giving them.
*  And I don't think that's all about absorption capability.
*  I mean, some of it we just thought or said, whether we thought it or not, I don't know,
*  that if we gave them this kind of weapon, Russia would take that as an escalation that
*  might lead to a different kind of appraisal or a different kind of calculation from Putin.
*  And the argument I've heard about this is it not giving Ukraine the kind of advanced
*  weaponry that could help them really win the war is not actually a way of deterring Putin.
*  This idea that we're going to balance this out when Russia actually has done the cross-border
*  incursion and Russia actually does still have more manpower than Ukraine, that we are making
*  a mistake in the calculus here, that Putin has already escalated, that he's already terrified
*  of defeat.
*  But allowing him to stay in this middle ground is allowing an extended equilibrium that just
*  creates more constant danger as opposed to an actual resolution.
*  Look, if I were the Ukrainians, I would be arguing, making exactly that case, and I would
*  argue forcefully for more weapons sooner, as Winston Churchill argued passionately that
*  the United States was not giving enough weaponry to Britain, you know, in 41 even.
*  But the US is a global power.
*  This is not the only area it's engaged in.
*  It has to make sure that it has these broader strategic interests in mind.
*  I don't get the sense that, as I say, maybe there could have been some more sped up version
*  of what they're doing.
*  But I do think that concern about how far you go in terms of an outright invasion of
*  Russia by a NATO assisted force is a legitimate concern.
*  I think that the Russians have not actually done as much as they could have done.
*  I mean, Russia has the largest nuclear arsenal in the world.
*  It has a huge army.
*  It has the capacity to do much more damage in Ukraine proper.
*  Most of the damage they've done has been in the parts of Ukraine that they believe should
*  be incorporated into Russia, the Donbas and that band of Ukraine.
*  They could unleash much more havoc on Ukraine itself.
*  Now, they would pay a huge price.
*  But I don't think it's fair to say that the Russians have done everything they can.
*  In fact, that's what scares me.
*  I think the Russians could go up this escalation chain.
*  There was a sense early in the war that this was leading to not just a newly united West,
*  but in particular a united Europe led by a more muscular Germany.
*  It's a lot of excitement that Germany was not just funding Ukraine, but also saying
*  it was going to spend a lot more on its own defense.
*  Has that vision of a stronger Europe led by a more assertive Germany panned out?
*  Absolutely.
*  I think that the thing that has always kept NATO vital is the sense of a real threat.
*  At the end of the day, alliances cannot operate in a vacuum.
*  After the Cold War, there really was this sense of what was NATO about?
*  What was the West about?
*  The West has always existed as a civilizational entity.
*  It's always existed in cultural terms.
*  But in political strategic terms, the West really only came together as a meaningful
*  concept in response to a threatening East, the communist world, particularly the Soviet
*  Union.
*  When that went away, the West as a strategic idea did lose a lot of its sense.
*  You could feel that NATO flailing around trying to figure out what to do.
*  This has revived the core purpose of the West as a strategic concept.
*  I think you see it most importantly in this transformation of Germany.
*  The Germans, for obvious historical reasons, have been very reluctant to have a significant
*  defense posture.
*  When to speak about defense issues and things like that in a larger sense.
*  Merkel was, for example, the most remarkable figure in this regard.
*  She was clearly the most powerful figure in Europe.
*  But she was very hesitant to put herself out there as the leader of Europe, the leader
*  of the world.
*  When Time Magazine chose her as their person of the year, she not only refused to give
*  them an interview, she wouldn't even sit for a photograph.
*  I remember asking, I think it was Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time at the time, what was the
*  last person who refused to give you a sit down for a portrait when they were named person
*  of the year?
*  She said it was 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini.
*  The Germans were very reluctant to be seen as these big actors on the world stage.
*  That's changed.
*  I think one of the things that cripples that united European front is that Britain is no
*  longer part of the European Union.
*  But otherwise, I do think the West has come together and the United States has become,
*  there's a kind of a de facto US leadership that is much less contested than it was.
*  Macron made waves when he talked about where Europe should go on China.
*  But right now, the pressing issue is Russia.
*  And on that, the Europeans are entirely united and happy to have the United States lead the
*  alliance.
*  I want to talk about the US and Ukraine because you're having more internal division over
*  US support for Ukraine now.
*  Ron DeSantis called it a, quote, territorial dispute, which is a kind of language.
*  It is a very clear signaling about his take there.
*  There is a recent Economist YouGov poll that found a plurality of Republicans now oppose
*  funding Ukraine.
*  What do you make of the Republican Party's division?
*  It sometimes feels like mounting turn against US support for Ukraine.
*  I'm very worried about it.
*  And I think that if you were to look at it in historical terms, what is happening is
*  the Republican Party is returning to its more traditional position on foreign policy, which
*  has been isolation.
*  The Republican Party was the party of isolationism in the 20s and the 30s.
*  This was the most bitter debate that took place in America in the last 100 years on
*  foreign policy was not Vietnam.
*  It was entry into World War II.
*  And the Republicans were staunchly on the side of isolationism then.
*  So that's just 60 or 70 years ago.
*  The Republican Party is returning to those roots.
*  Trump as often in this case is the kind of weird, intuitive guy who figured out where
*  the base was.
*  DeSantis is trying to follow it.
*  If you look at the people who still support an internationalist foreign policy, my fear
*  is many of them are kind of holdovers from a different world, the Lindsey Grahams of
*  the world.
*  But if you look at the young hotheads, where the kind of energy and action of the party
*  is unfortunately, it looks like a very isolationist party.
*  And I think that over time, we'll see how Ukraine works out because commitments have
*  already been made and that Mitch McConnell matters a lot and people like that matter
*  a lot.
*  Over time, the Republican Party is becoming the party of isolation, which means that having
*  the United States fully engaged in the world, which I believe is profoundly important for
*  the United States and for the world, is going to become a very partisan issue in a way that
*  it has not been since 1942.
*  How has China's attitude towards and role in the war in Ukraine changed?
*  It's very difficult to tell, to be honest.
*  People who claim to be able to read what is going on in the minds of five people in Beijing
*  and really one are, I think, exaggerating.
*  But it does appear that they started out with a much more comfortable sense that Russia
*  was an ally, they were going to support Russia, Russia was a big power, it would be able to
*  do whatever it wanted.
*  The Chinese have a very real polity conception of international affairs.
*  There was this one moment where a Chinese ambassador at an ASEAN meeting, I think it
*  was, let's slip something that you're not supposed to say.
*  But at one point when there was pushback on something the Chinese wanted, he said, look,
*  strong countries, big countries are meant to tell little countries what to do.
*  That's the way the world works.
*  And then he apologized for it and took it back.
*  But I think that's a very revealing statement.
*  The way the Chinese view it, Russia is a big strong country.
*  There's this little country on its border, Ukraine.
*  Of course, Ukraine has to be subservient to Russia.
*  And that's the natural order of things.
*  And that will be established.
*  I think they've come to realize that they underestimated the degree to which the Ukrainians
*  would oppose.
*  They underestimated the degree to which the West would effectively unite and oppose the
*  war.
*  And so what you notice is that they are, first of all, there are not as many profuse statements
*  of love and affiliation.
*  Xi Jinping does not seem to be a very effusive and emotional man.
*  But he has often referred to Putin as something like my dear friend, my very best friend or
*  versions, variations of that.
*  They talk about staying up all night talking when they're together.
*  It's very...
*  Exactly.
*  It's very bro-like.
*  Yes.
*  And from two people who do not seem, particularly Xi, who seems this very formal, measured guy.
*  They just imagine them in their jammies.
*  And by the way, I think that's some key to understanding the alliance is a personal one.
*  It's not just strategy because the Russians and Chinese have often had difficulties.
*  But these two people are united in two important things.
*  They believe that when regimes lose faith in themselves, as Gorbachev lost faith in
*  the communist regime, that that is the moment when you crack and crumble.
*  And the second is that the US-led global order must be diminished, eroded, attacked.
*  And so that keeps them very strongly together.
*  But the Chinese are saying less of that kind of stuff.
*  There are these overtures to Ukraine, which I think are mostly PR.
*  But the fact that they felt like they had to do some PR tells you that they feel like
*  plan A was not working.
*  So I think just as Russia went to a plan B after not being able to conquer Kiev, I think
*  the Chinese are on a plan B.
*  And the plan B now is to try to appear to the real audience, which is the global south,
*  that they are not quite in the same category as Russia.
*  They are the neutral power.
*  They keep making the point that they are actually neutral on this war.
*  I want to put a pin on that point that the real audience is the global south, because
*  I want to talk at some point about the non-aligned nations here.
*  But this was a way in which Xi's meeting with Zelensky struck me at least as important,
*  The fear that people have had for a long time is that China would become to Russia what
*  America and Europe are to Ukraine.
*  And China boasting a little bit on the world stage, that they're now talking to both parties,
*  seem to make them twisting into a much more pro-Russian stance a lot less likely.
*  In terms of how they want to be seen, they want to be seen as a broker, not as the weaponry
*  supplier for Putin.
*  I think it's a slight shift.
*  They are still pretty committed to the Russians.
*  The man they sent as the negotiator between Russia and Ukraine was the former Chinese
*  ambassador to Russia, who is well known to be a deeply pro-Russian diplomat.
*  They have never even simply acknowledged that what Russia has done has been to violate Ukraine's
*  sovereignty in a completely illegitimate manner, which strikes me as rule number one
*  in all of this.
*  But I think you're right.
*  It's an important shift.
*  And part of it is about this issue of trying to come across to the Brazils, the South Africans,
*  the Indonesians of the world as less culpable as the Russians are.
*  My read is that tensions between US and China are substantially higher than they were a
*  year ago.
*  That they're even higher now than they were under Trump, where the rhetoric was high,
*  but there was always a feeling that it wasn't being taken quite that seriously, but that
*  now something has actually shifted in the firmament.
*  And there's a much deeper sense on both sides that we are in a kind of conflict, even if
*  the boundaries of that conflict are not well defined.
*  Is that how you read it?
*  Yeah, I think that's exactly right.
*  And I think it's for two reasons.
*  The Chinese had made a bet that Trump was an aberration, that he represented, as with
*  so many things, a kind of strange, personalistic, populist moment.
*  And that when Biden came into power, you have a kind of return to the, essentially the Obama-Bush
*  policy, which was broadly consistent.
*  I mean, US policy toward China was remarkably bipartisan from 1972 all the way up really
*  to Trump.
*  It had been fairly consistent, but it turned out not to be true.
*  That Biden represented a version of the Trump policy better executed in many ways and more
*  effective.
*  And particularly the technology bans have really come to bite.
*  So the second part is that this stuff is exacting a price.
*  I think that the Biden people have made several crucial decisions that are correct, particularly
*  on the technology front.
*  But they have also needlessly provoked the Chinese in ways that I think are largely an
*  expression of the domestic politics of the moment.
*  So take, for example, today's news.
*  The Chinese refused to meet at the highest level on a military-to-military basis.
*  I think it did Secretary of Defense with their equivalent.
*  And the Americans seemed chagrined about it.
*  Now, the Chinese guy who they were trying to meet with is under sanctions from the United
*  States, personally under sanctions from the United States.
*  What did they expect?
*  You couldn't get a third world country to agree on those terms.
*  And they're asking China, which thinks of itself as in some ways a peer of the United
*  States.
*  So there's that disconnect that is still, I think, unfortunately, part of the US-China
*  relationship, as I say, needlessly making things more dangerous.
*  But some of the core policies, particularly around technology or on building alliances
*  with Asia, the Biden people have done the right thing.
*  They've done it very effectively.
*  And that's what's, I think, unnerved the Chinese.
*  One of Speaker McCarthy's early moves when he took the gavel was to create this House
*  Select Committee on China.
*  And it was one of the things he did that Democrats loved and Democrats wanted to be on the committee.
*  You watched the first hearing of that.
*  Tell me how you understood the tone, the message, what was different between the Democrats and
*  Republicans and what was and how would you describe that hearing?
*  Overall, what it made me realize is we all spend our time talking about how terrible
*  it is that there is no bipartisanship in Washington.
*  And I watched it and thought, oh my God, this is what happens when you have bipartisanship
*  in Washington.
*  You have unthinking groupthink.
*  You have a kind of herd mentality.
*  And that's what really was going on with this.
*  It became a competition of who could bash China more.
*  It became largely devoted to a kind of existential argument about really why the Chinese Communist
*  Party should be overthrown.
*  That was the subtext of the entire hearing.
*  And what I worry about it is when we get into those kind of moments in American history,
*  where first of all, we think the enemy is 10 feet tall.
*  We think we are existentially threatened.
*  We do very bad things.
*  Think of the period in the 50s when we thought this about the Soviet Union and McCarthyism
*  and the paranoia about the missile gap and all those kind of impulses that led us into
*  Vietnam, that led the CIA to try to overthrow dozens of regimes around the world, mostly
*  unsuccessfully, but with huge lasting impact in terms of how those countries perceive the
*  United States.
*  One of the most tragic failures of American foreign policy, because all those countries
*  thought of America as very different from the Europeans, as being anti-colonial.
*  And very quickly, by the late 1960s, the United States was actually in many ways worse because
*  we had been intervening so much in these places.
*  Think about after 9-11, the run up to the Iraq War, the war itself.
*  We lose the capacity to think.
*  We lose the capacity to assess.
*  One of the things that I've been trying to articulate is the idea we need to right size
*  the Chinese threat.
*  The United States is still way more powerful than China.
*  We are the dominant power in the international system.
*  It's a very complicated international system because we can't exercise influence like we
*  used to be able to for all kinds of reasons we can get into.
*  But China is just not this overwhelming threat to us.
*  If we can right size it, if we can act with a certain degree of confidence and calm and
*  surety, we can put together building blocks that deter China, give it the opportunity
*  if it wants to integrate into the world, preserve our interests.
*  We need to run fast.
*  We don't need to run scared.
*  It felt to me a couple of months ago that there was a sense in the Biden administration
*  they got a little bit too far.
*  And so Blinken was going to go to China.
*  And then this balloon, this Chinese balloon floats across the US.
*  And it's clear at the beginning the Biden administration doesn't think this is a very
*  big deal.
*  And then the chorus of pressure from Republicans starts up and every news network is following
*  the balloon on live balloon cam.
*  Tell me now with a few months of distance, first what you think or what the people you
*  talk to think happened with that balloon.
*  What was it and why did it end up floating in this very obvious public way across US
*  territory?
*  And then what do you think the consequences of that episode have been?
*  The best I can put together is it was some kind of a let's put it this way, a dual use
*  balloon.
*  It was a meteorological balloon that also had some espionage capacity.
*  It did seem to veer off course.
*  I think it is one of several balloons that has been sent around various places around
*  the world.
*  And the Biden administration didn't think it was as big a deal because look, the Chinese
*  have hundreds of spy satellites up in the air that are orbiting the Earth 24 seven have
*  taken hundreds of thousands of photographs of every sensitive site in the United States.
*  They're in a lot of our computers.
*  They're in a lot of our computers.
*  There is some marginal information you can get from a low flying balloon, but from everything
*  I can gather, not that much.
*  And of course, it's important to always remember we do this much more than they do it.
*  So we've got all this capacity.
*  And so nations spy on each other.
*  And so they were trying to keep it as you say, they were not as perturbed about it.
*  And then the drumbeat begins and then it turns and maybe this is a wonderful example of modern
*  politics where because it's visual, because you can see it, because CNN can track it.
*  It was so bad that it was so visual.
*  Yeah, it was like a low speed car chase.
*  It was like the OJ Simpson chase of espionage problems.
*  Exactly.
*  And it's you know, and every minute sub day people are like, why is he not doing something?
*  And so almost to compensate for that, the Americans shoot down three other balloons,
*  which as far as we can tell what $20 weather balloons and some meteorological club had
*  put up in the air.
*  I don't think they got any compensation from the US government.
*  And by the way, we used I believe there were $300,000
*  Sidewinder missiles to hit these $20 balloons.
*  And if you recall, we were going to be shown all the espionage capacities of the Chinese with the
*  first one that was taken down.
*  I'm still waiting.
*  And from what I'm told, there's not a lot to show that.
*  Yes, it was probably dual use.
*  But I thought we were going to be shown something that made it absolutely clear what the Chinese
*  were doing.
*  None of that happened.
*  So in the aftermath of that, the US cancels Blinken's trip.
*  To my knowledge, it has not been reset.
*  As you said, we are having trouble having the kinds of high level meetings we would like to
*  have with the Chinese despite other escalatory positions on both sides.
*  It seemed to me and other people who know more about this have said to me that the balloon just
*  came at a terrible time.
*  That there was a moment of attempted thaw.
*  And there have been some things after that, a speech by Janet Yellen and others.
*  But to the extent there was this moment of trying to retract the relationship, the balloon was
*  this escalation on both ends.
*  It hardened the politics on both sides.
*  And it has just made whatever was being attempted there a lot harder.
*  Do you think that's right that there was a real consequence to that?
*  Or did that in the scheme of things not really matter?
*  What it revealed was that the relationship was very fragile and that a small thing could take it off course.
*  I think that there would have been another balloon.
*  In other words, something like this would have come up.
*  If the relationship was as fragile as it seems to be, something or the other would have derailed it.
*  You crashed a spy plane in China in 2001.
*  The EP5, whatever it was called, incident where the plane crashed in Hainan Island.
*  I think it took 11 days to resolve.
*  Colin Powell was Secretary of State and he issued an apology.
*  It was famously translated in two different ways where you could translate it to mean regret.
*  You could translate it to mean apology.
*  It's inconceivable today that we would be able to resolve something like that.
*  It's inconceivable that Blinken could get away with issuing an apology or regret to the Chinese.
*  So that's what worries me about where we are with US-China relations.
*  Look, we are going to be competitive.
*  We're going to be competitive in the economic realm.
*  We're going to be competitive in the geopolitical realm.
*  But we want to find a way to have a working relationship with the country that is the
*  second most powerful country in the world, which is, by the way, our third largest trading partner.
*  We trade $700 billion of goods with China every year.
*  We want to have a good working relationship so that when moments like this happen,
*  there is a mechanism to resolve them.
*  There is a path to resolve them.
*  There's channels of communication open so that things don't happen that are accidental.
*  Things don't happen that push you into a corner where you can't get out.
*  That's my fear on both sides.
*  There is so much nationalism now built up that it's difficult to imagine how you can,
*  quote unquote, make a concession to China.
*  That's why Biden has not removed the tariffs on China.
*  The Chinese have politics, too.
*  There's a reality of how much they can also do, even though it's a dictatorship.
*  The dictators stay in power partly by judging how far they can move things.
*  That places us in a very bad situation if, as you say,
*  something like that spy plane incident were to happen again.
*  Another issue that's pretty live right now in terms of our relationship with China is TikTok.
*  I have weirdly strong opinions on this one, but rather than put my own spin on the ball,
*  the governor of Montana is trying to ban TikTok outright, and not because social media is bad,
*  but because in his view, China is bad.
*  TikTok could be a tool of espionage, of influence, particularly of other kinds of problems.
*  What do you think of banning TikTok?
*  As a father of two sort of teenage girls, I delighted the prospect of TikTok being banned
*  because I have no doubt in my mind that TikTok is harmful, not TikTok particularly,
*  but social media in general is harmful for teenagers.
*  I believe all that research that I have now studied with some degree of seriousness
*  that Jonathan Haidt and others have put out.
*  TikTok is particularly bad because it's particularly good,
*  by which I mean it's particularly effective, in fact, stunningly effective.
*  But I am very troubled by the argument that it should be banned in general,
*  and that it should be banned because it's Chinese, because it fundamentally gives up on the idea of
*  the United States as a free society.
*  Let's say that the Chinese are using TikTok to subtly pass information to us that is anti-American.
*  Do we not want to live in a country where the Chinese government can publish pamphlets that
*  tell us, your system of government sucks, ours is much better?
*  We've been getting that kind of information since the founding of the republic.
*  The idea that we should ban information that is being produced by whomever in whatever form
*  that tells you that America is a bad place, that other countries are better, that our system is
*  bad, it strikes me as kind of giving up on the idea of America.
*  So that's the argument that TikTok is sort of subtly spreading Chinese propaganda.
*  Fine, let them.
*  I mean, we have to be a strong enough country to withstand it.
*  Secondly, that they're eavesdropping.
*  This is one of those arguments that the more you push, the more you try to kind of understand
*  what it means, it sort of falls apart.
*  All these companies, social media companies, collect data.
*  They all sell them to third parties.
*  The Chinese government would not need to create a company, then have the luck of it being super
*  successful, and then use that company to extract data.
*  You could just buy it from Facebook, you could buy it from Google, you could buy it from Amazon.
*  For all we know, they are doing that.
*  And by the way, as you say, there is a very extensive Chinese cyber spying operation already
*  underway.
*  What they would gain from using TikTok to determine what dance videos teenage girls like.
*  I don't want to trivialize it, but my point is whatever real information they could gain
*  about people's preferences, their voting behavior, they can get all that anyway.
*  Well, let me take the other side of it, particularly on the attentional issue.
*  So we don't tend to let governments, we have a hostile antagonistic relationship with
*  control critical infrastructure, different kinds.
*  We wouldn't let a country we were not in good relationship with hold a bunch of electrical
*  utilities.
*  We wouldn't let them run nuclear security.
*  We don't let the Soviet Union own television stations here.
*  To me, part of the argument that makes me friendlier to banning TikTok is that this
*  is attentional infrastructure and attention is critical.
*  I take your point on the pamphlet.
*  And I would have no problem with the Chinese government placing op-eds, running its own
*  newspaper on some level, publishing a book that was available in bookstores, or you could
*  buy on Amazon.
*  But because we don't understand how the TikTok algorithm works, we don't know what people
*  are seeing.
*  And I don't think it's as easy or as narrow in a way as what you would get on there is
*  propaganda meant to make the Chinese government look better.
*  To your point about how Putin understands meddling in other countries to be valuable
*  to him.
*  He's not meddling in a way to make us like Russia.
*  He's meddling in a way to take moments of chaos and division and try to make them
*  profound and deep enough to weaken America.
*  So you imagine something like a more contested version of the 2020 election.
*  Think the 2000 election in the 2020 era when we have much more polarized parties.
*  And now on TikTok, somebody turns up the dial on just rampant conspiracy theorizing and
*  things that get Americans ever more at each other's throats.
*  And we don't even really know that it's happening.
*  It's just a kind of attentional dark matter that is making us hate each other more or
*  is making Americans turn towards Trump again or whatever it might be.
*  The thing that worries me about it is because we can't track what is happening on it.
*  It could be used for much more sophisticated kinds of attentional manipulation than simply
*  the Chinese government has dropped a bunch of flyers and say from the Chinese government,
*  China is great.
*  I think that the problem with that argument is it feels like we are in this digital world where
*  we can't track any of this stuff anymore.
*  Just that's the nature of it.
*  And that's even before you get to AI.
*  It's just too diverse.
*  It's too disaggregated.
*  It's the fundamental shift that's taken place in information is you've gone from a one to
*  many broadcasting system to a many to many network system.
*  And when you have a many to many network system, there is no central node.
*  It's all happening at a disaggregated, distributed level where the algorithm is
*  noticing what you like and giving you more of that and noticing what I like and giving
*  me more of that.
*  So it's very difficult to imagine how you would control any such digital product.
*  So if you have a problem with TikTok in that sense, what comes next?
*  Do we ban Chinese cars?
*  Because Chinese cars, after all cars, are essentially now digital products.
*  They're software on wheels and the cars know where you go and maybe they could be listening
*  in on you.
*  So there is that sci-fi prospect that you can raise about almost anything.
*  And so are we then talking about a complete decoupling of the US and Chinese economies?
*  And are we just comfortable with doing it just with China?
*  Are there other countries you wouldn't want to involve?
*  And I do come back to the fundamental question, which is, are we not comfortable with
*  information from whatever source in whatever form that criticizes us, that enrages us,
*  that does whatever it does, that information is always done?
*  It feels to me like the distinction you're making between books and pamphlets on the
*  one side and TikTok on the other is you're saying they can do this stuff as long as I
*  don't think it's very efficient.
*  If it's very effective, I'm against it.
*  But if it's ineffective and inefficient by using books and pamphlets, it's okay.
*  I kind of think that is a distinction I'm making.
*  That's not a very philosophical distinction.
*  So you can imagine people saying, we're going to allow China to do whatever we want until
*  it gets very good at it.
*  And by the way, this is exactly what the Chinese think.
*  The Chinese think that the United States was perfectly happy to have China integrate into
*  the world economy until they started creating companies like Huawei, which was super good
*  and actually had better 5G technology than we did.
*  And then we suddenly said, oh, by the way, none of the world rules apply.
*  But I think there is an argument for this.
*  And in a way, weirdly, China doesn't just think it about us, but they think it for themselves.
*  One thing that is interesting about the TikTok example is it isn't like China lets Facebook
*  operate in the country.
*  It isn't like you can have unfettered access to Twitter or LinkedIn or really any kind
*  of major American media or digital media, Google search.
*  Right.
*  So they've developed their function almost own Internet with its own mediating players.
*  And there are moments of overlap, but it doesn't look using the Internet in China like using
*  it in America.
*  And precisely because they think that would be dangerous for them.
*  And I don't think you have to be out and out an authoritarian government to think that
*  there are dangers with having the attentional structure of your society controlled by
*  companies that can easily be influenced, heavily influenced by the government you're
*  in a very antagonistic relationship with.
*  Well, but think about what you're saying.
*  You are looking admiringly and longingly at the Chinese Communist Party's totalitarian
*  control of information and saying, gee, I wish we could have more of that in the United States.
*  But I'm saying I think they might have 15 or 20 percent of a point.
*  I think the idea that China can't be right about anything.
*  But it feels to me like this is pretty fundamental.
*  This question of whether you believe in free flows of information.
*  Look, I think the 15 to 20 percent that you're describing is actually very well taken care
*  of by the Europeans.
*  The Europeans have much stronger regulation on the Internet than we do, particularly on
*  social media.
*  And what they've been trying to do is, first of all, all the data has to be housed in country.
*  All the data has to be monitored.
*  The Google operates under those constraints in Europe, for example.
*  I think that the kind of compromise that, ironically, the Trump administration was trying
*  to reach with TikTok made a lot of sense.
*  Yes, of course, the information should all be housed in the US.
*  It should all be monitored.
*  It should not be possible for there to be some kind of secret manipulation of it.
*  Technologists who I've talked to say that that is essentially what the European regulations
*  achieve and you could achieve something quite similar.
*  But I just feel very reluctant to give up on the idea of freedom in this very core space.
*  I don't want the response of the United States to China's creation of its own hermetically
*  sealed Internet to be that we create a hermetically sealed Internet.
*  I have always had the view that the United States has succeeded in part because we air
*  our dirty laundry in public.
*  We allow ourselves to see everything and deal with all the messy dysfunctional realities
*  that that produces.
*  And out of that comes an ability to move forward much better than societies that don't talk
*  about these problems, that in some way repress, suppress them.
*  It sometimes feels like a sewer, right?
*  But what you're seeing is real.
*  It's there.
*  You can't pretend it doesn't exist.
*  So now let me flip this because I've been taking the hawk position for a bit.
*  I've in many ways felt much more comfortable with the idea that the U.S.
*  should have curbs on the level of Chinese technological penetration of the U.S.
*  than that the U.S.
*  should curb China's technological advancement itself.
*  Like when I think of not just provocation, but the level of enmity suggested by a decision
*  to say, hey, we're not going to have TikTok here, rightly or wrongly.
*  That's one level.
*  To say, we are going to try to hold you back from the technological frontiers of, say,
*  semiconductors, which is what we have said now.
*  Even if that is a good move, and I think you suggested earlier you support it, and I have
*  very mixed feelings, but I'm not saying I don't support it.
*  That has struck me as a genuine phase shift of the relationship.
*  And as something where when you imagine how China is looking at us and how they will treat
*  us and understand our relationship to their rise, that it really does make good on, I think,
*  every fear they have had that we are going to try to stop them from becoming the preeminent,
*  or even a preeminent world superpower.
*  To say we're going to try to hold you back is very different than saying we're going to
*  try to protect ourselves.
*  So I actually think that this one is entirely justified because this is a case where what
*  the United States is concerned about is that the Chinese military, which is at the end of the day,
*  a competitive military, particularly in the South China seas and around Taiwan, a competitive
*  adversary, is going to acquire technologies that allow it to prevail, to enhance its military
*  capacity.
*  And we have always been very sensitive about the idea of militaries that we were not comfortable
*  with acquiring super advanced capabilities.
*  There are still in place today sanctions that do not allow the United States to transfer certain
*  technologies to India because India was not a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,
*  partly as a result of Cold War stuff where the US was pro-Pakistan and anti-India.
*  So it's not such a leap to say that you don't want China to have this most advanced capacity.
*  And I think what the administration has done has been to try to use a surgeon's scalpel to really
*  take the high end of it and cordon that off.
*  Remember, the semiconductor chips that are being denied to China, I think, constitute less than
*  5% of the market.
*  There may actually be even less than 3% of the market.
*  So 95, 98% of the market is open.
*  We buy a lot of Chinese chips.
*  The stuff that goes into washing machines and all that is, much of it is Chinese.
*  Much of the assembly of computers is.
*  But what we're saying is at the very high end, the stuff that really could make a decisive
*  difference on the battlefield, we're not comfortable with you having it.
*  It is true that the ancillary effect is that it also does slow down Chinese growth.
*  Yeah, it isn't just battlefield.
*  I mean, these are the chips that power AI.
*  They're the chips that power cloud computing.
*  I mean, they're not just dual use in the way that the weather balloon, the Chinese balloon,
*  is dual use.
*  I mean, they really are used for non-military.
*  But also military.
*  But also military, yes.
*  So the way I would put it is the goal is military.
*  The side effect is.
*  And by the way, they will still be able to do a lot of this stuff.
*  I mean, because you can put chips together.
*  If you don't have a 5 nanometer chip, you can put two tens together.
*  You're using more computing power.
*  You're using more energy.
*  It's a much more inefficient process.
*  So it's slowing them down.
*  It's not killing the Chinese industry as far as I can tell.
*  But I think that's entirely justifiable.
*  The one that was more difficult for me, honestly, was Huawei.
*  The thing I think we didn't realize is that the degree to which trying to ban Huawei
*  became for them a sign that we were trying to keep them down.
*  Because Huawei was, in many ways, one of the great institutions, a great pride in China.
*  It was a private company that had made it on its own, was out competing every Western company
*  at the very high end technology.
*  I'm not saying we shouldn't have done it.
*  I'm just saying that for the Chinese, that became a sign of exactly what you're saying.
*  That this is not a case where the West wants to compete with us.
*  They want to cripple us so that we can't grow.
*  When we talked last time, you said that a major strategic objective
*  for America should be trying to split China and Russia.
*  In the years since, have we been even trying to do that, in your view?
*  No, and I still think it's a mistake.
*  I think that you could much more easily isolate Russia by trying to improve communications
*  with China.
*  We do it in this way, as I say, with one arm tied behind the back.
*  Where we say we'd like to meet with your top defensive shield, but by the way,
*  he's under sanctions.
*  How can you have a serious working relationship with a country under those conditions?
*  That's where I feel like we have lost the space to maneuver.
*  This is part of a broader issue, which is, I think, we don't think a lot about how the
*  world looks like to other countries.
*  How the Chinese would take a response like that.
*  This is one of the reasons why we're constantly surprised by the Indians.
*  Take, for example, something like global warming.
*  We keep saying the Chinese are not doing anything on global warming because they're
*  horrible anti-American dictators.
*  With the Indians, who are the pro-American Democrats, their position on global warming
*  is essentially the same.
*  It's as hard to get them to do anything.
*  In fact, the Indians are very ornery on all kinds of things.
*  Part of that is that we don't understand what the world looks like from New Delhi
*  or from South Africa.
*  And one of the things we've lost in the last 20 or 30 years because of American dominance
*  is we used to know a lot about foreign countries.
*  If you look at the people who made up their way up the American foreign policy hierarchy,
*  a lot of them were deeply schooled in languages and cultures of other countries.
*  George Cannon, being the perfect example, spoke fluent Russian, had spent years in Russia,
*  understood the society.
*  You'd be hard pressed to find a lot of people like that in America today.
*  Mike Gallagher, the guy who runs the China committee you mentioned at the House,
*  I believe I have this accurately, has never been to China.
*  If you were to ask yourself, the people who are making policy toward China in the United
*  States right now, how many of them speak Mandarin, you'd be surprised at how few people
*  know these countries.
*  And that creates a kind of structural tenure for American diplomacy.
*  And then we're surprised that one of my favorite examples is Turkey.
*  This is going back to the Iraq War.
*  We thought of Turkey as this compliant American ally that basically depended on the U.S.
*  for its military assistance.
*  We had lost sight that Turkey had become this consolidated, more democratic, more successful,
*  more proud country.
*  And this is almost literally true.
*  We kind of forgot to ask it whether we could use Turkey as a base to invade Iraq.
*  Most people forget Iraq was meant to be invaded on a two-front invasion from the South in
*  Kuwait up and then from the North through Turkey down.
*  The Turks surprised the U.S. and said, no, we are now a functioning democracy.
*  This has to go to Parliament.
*  And I think it lost in Parliament by a couple of votes.
*  So that's a perfect example of how we haven't noticed how what I call in the post-American
*  world the rise of the rest.
*  It's this fundamental change that's taken place in the international system where these
*  countries are no longer willing to be pawns on the table.
*  They want to be players in their own right.
*  And we say the right things sometimes.
*  We mouth the cliches, but we don't really understand these places.
*  There was a great issue of foreign affairs that just came out.
*  And I really recommend people go buy it or read it online because it was all about the
*  view of America, of the West from what they called the non-aligned nations.
*  Right.
*  So depending how you want to count and depending on which vote nations representing two-thirds
*  of the global population, they've not been with us in Russia.
*  They are not necessarily with Russia either, but they have not bought into the Western
*  narrative that what Russia has done is an unforgivable breach of the system.
*  The sanctions are a good idea, et cetera.
*  And one of the really interesting essays in that issue was a piece by Nehru Palma Rao,
*  who is a former foreign secretary of India.
*  And there's been all this frustration in America that India has been non-aligned
*  around Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  And she says India's quote, and I want to read this for a minute here,
*  refusal to speak up in Kiev's favor has brought it under intense scrutiny and questioning by
*  friends and partners in the West.
*  But India, rightfully, sees these critiques as hypocritical.
*  The West routinely cuts deals with violent autocracies to advance its own interests.
*  The United States is improving ties with Venezuela to get more oil.
*  Europe is signing energy contracts with oppressive Arab Gulf regimes.
*  Remarkably, the West nonetheless claims that its foreign policy is guided by human rights
*  and democracy.
*  India, at least, lays no claim to being the conscience keeper of the world.
*  And so your point about how the rest of the world sees something that comes up again and
*  these essays, and particularly in India's view, is that we talk about a rules-based order.
*  We talk about a values-based foreign policy.
*  But we only follow that really when it benefits us.
*  And so the request that other countries should go against their own interests, maybe in this
*  case, cheap Russian energy, to back that order rings a little bit hollow.
*  Nehru Palma Rao, Ph.D.
*  Yeah. You've pointed to, I think, a very profound problem that we face.
*  One of the central challenges of American foreign policy for the next 20 to 30 years,
*  at least, is how do you sustain the Western-led rules-based international order in the absence
*  of the kind of American dominance that the United States has had?
*  As American dominance fades, what happens to this edifice that we've built that I still believe has
*  been profoundly better than any alternate international system?
*  That we've, you know, the very fact that Putin's invasion of Ukraine has galvanized so much of the
*  world, not all of it, is that it's rare.
*  I mean, since 1945, there's a wonderful book by two Yale law professors which points this out.
*  The number of forcible annexations is down to a handful of times in 75 years.
*  If you go and look at the 75 years before 1945, I mean, it happened so routinely that you could
*  barely count how many times that it happened.
*  So this order is a better order than anything we've seen before.
*  But we don't seem to realize exactly what you say, which is the hypocrisy that attends the idea that
*  we can constantly deviate from it.
*  We get to invade Iraq.
*  We get to not sign on to the International Criminal Court.
*  We do things like we are accusing China and the South China Seas of violating the law of the Seas
*  Treaty, a treaty to which we are not a signatory.
*  And so there's so much of that kind of inbuilt hypocrisy that we have gotten so used to that we
*  don't even bother about it.
*  Bob Kagan, the writer, once tried to rationalize it by saying, you know, it's like we are the
*  gardener that is maintaining the Garden of Eden.
*  But to maintain that beautiful garden, that wonderful, peaceful space, the gardener can't
*  follow the rules.
*  The gardener has to be the thug who enforces the, you know, the rule.
*  Well, I mean, that's a very self-serving way of looking at it.
*  The way that most countries look at it is when you want oil, you go to Saudi Arabia and you don't
*  worry about the fact that it's a medieval absolute monarchy.
*  When you want to change your policy, as you say, on Venezuela, you suddenly decide, oh, we were
*  trying to overthrow you last year.
*  This year, we want to buy your oil.
*  And we do this all the time.
*  And then when the Indians do it, we shriek and we say, how dare you?
*  You're supposed to be a democracy or South Africa or Indonesia, rather than recognizing that they
*  all have their interests.
*  I mean, the Indian case is particularly complicated because the Indians buy most of their advanced
*  weaponry from Russia.
*  Now, why do they buy most of their advanced weaponry from Russia?
*  Largely because the United States wouldn't sell it to them.
*  During the Cold War, the US was allied with Pakistan.
*  The Indians also violated the NPT, which, by the way, so did the Pakistanis.
*  Nuclear proliferation treaty.
*  By testing nuclear weapons.
*  And so the Indians have developed this dependency.
*  But there's a larger issue also, which is the Indians have always relied on Russia for
*  unwavering support on something like Kashmir, which is the disputed territory between India
*  and Pakistan.
*  And they know that the Russians will be the reliable veto in the UN Security Council on that.
*  So they're not going to burn their bridges with the Russians all at once.
*  They've distanced themselves a little bit.
*  They've done some things.
*  A better way to put it would be this.
*  America has never understood nationalism.
*  One of our biggest problems is that we look at the world and we say to ourselves, but
*  we're bringing you all these wonderful things.
*  Why don't you just take them and let us shower with you these benefits and tell you what
*  to do?
*  And we don't understand how strong that desire of doing your own thing is.
*  Whether it's in Iraq, whether it's in Vietnam, whether it's in Cuba, we don't understand
*  how the resistance to external domination can be so powerful.
*  There's this very famous, perhaps apocryphal story when Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy
*  of India, says in frustration to Gandhi when they are negotiating independence, we can't
*  just leave India.
*  If we leave India, it will be chaos.
*  And Gandhi looks at him and says, yes, but it will be our chaos.
*  And that sense that something imperfect that is ours is better than something even better
*  that might be provided by foreign domination.
*  But this is something you would understand better about the sociology of the American
*  foreign policy establishment.
*  I've tended in my career to cover domestic policy.
*  I could tell you a lot about the weird psychology of American domestic policy fighting.
*  But I've been doing practically more reporting over the past year or two on America and
*  China.
*  And I'm constantly told when I ask, well, why don't we want this?
*  What gives us the moral standing to say China should not become powerful in this way or
*  we should not permit this?
*  And I'll hear, well, China doesn't really support the rules-based international order.
*  We're trying to protect the rules-based international order.
*  And then I'll say, okay, but Iraq and okay, but these treaties and okay.
*  I mean, nobody thinks globally that we follow that order.
*  And I would say that the consistent response I get from people who genuinely, I think,
*  believe with all their heart in that order and also supported a number of deviations
*  from it, describe it as, yeah, well, nevertheless.
*  And I genuinely am puzzled by it because every contact I've ever had with foreign policy
*  representatives from other nations, our deviations look very large in their minds.
*  I do believe there is a belief among American, at least liberal foreign policy
*  establishment, the rules-based international order is the great achievement in foreign
*  policy of America.
*  And yet the damage of deviation after deviation, it really goes unremarked and it
*  continues.
*  Many in Europe think, I think fairly correctly, that we are at this point operating with
*  bi-American provisions and trade provisions that are beginning to look a lot like world
*  trade organization violations.
*  So that for everything we talk about free trade, the direction of industrial policy
*  in America, which I support in a lot of ways, but it undermines a lot of what we're saying
*  about French shoring and about the kind of world we seek to build.
*  There just seems to me to be a very deeply unresolved tension in the way that we don't
*  justify our foreign policy based on Pax Americana.
*  We justify it based on a rules-based order that we abide by sometimes and not others.
*  And you read this foreign affairs issue, but it's obviously not just there.
*  And the damage those contradictions do to our ability to mobilize other countries to
*  defend this order that we say we're defending seems much larger than we're willing to admit
*  or face up to.
*  Yeah, I mean, you're highlighting really a central, central issue because, as you put
*  it, we don't justify our policy on the basis of Pax Americana.
*  We don't justify it saying we're the United States.
*  We want to be the dominant power and we want a world that allows our interests and our
*  power to be protected and enhanced.
*  We try to articulate a set of ideas that could capture the imagination of the world.
*  And that's always been the American way ever since Franklin Roosevelt.
*  And those have to a large extent.
*  In the 40s and 50s, the whole decolonizing world was looking to America.
*  And people like Ho Chi Minh would make overtures to the Americans.
*  So there is a power in those American ideas because we do think in those broader terms.
*  But we then never seem to understand how serious it is that we are violating these
*  ideas, these rules.
*  And we never try to explain it.
*  We never try to do the diplomacy that was surrounded.
*  So, for example, forget even the naked protectionism of the Biden administration, which I think
*  is clearly a violation of the kind of free trade order that we've created.
*  Take something like the freezing of Russian assets and the use of the dollar in that way.
*  At one level, I totally support it.
*  But I have been urging Biden to give a speech saying, look, we understand that this seems
*  like a very arbitrary use of power that goes against the rules that countries, foreign
*  reserves are sacrosanct.
*  We have only done it in this very unusual circumstance where a country decided in an
*  unprovoked fashion to invade its neighbor.
*  That is the core violation of the rules-based order.
*  And because of that, in order to fight that fire, we have used a little fire ourselves.
*  We assure you we would never do something like this on a routine basis.
*  This is a kind of one-off.
*  We don't try to even articulate it that way.
*  And that's where some of the arrogance comes in.
*  We don't think to ourselves we need to explain these things.
*  And forget our enemies.
*  When Trump pulled out of the Iran deal, because of the power of the dollar, he kept in place
*  American secondary sanctions.
*  So even though the rest of the world wanted to trade with Iran, they couldn't.
*  And that has so frustrated the Europeans.
*  Because we would sanction them for trading.
*  Right.
*  It's a very complicated...
*  But basically, if the Americans say we will sanction you for trading, even though you're
*  part of the Iran deal, effectively they have to be cleared through the New York Fed.
*  This is what I've called our last true superpower weapon.
*  And because of that, the Europeans got so frustrated because they thought that Trump's
*  pulling out of the Iran deal was totally unjustified, unilateral, entirely a violation
*  of the rules-based order.
*  They set to work trying to find some alternative to a dollar-based system.
*  We have a system called SWIFT.
*  And the Europeans have been trying to set up a different one now.
*  I know all the economists tell me it's not going to work.
*  The dollar is inevitably the currency of last resort.
*  That may all be true.
*  But what does it say when your closest allies are now dead set on a project that for them
*  may take decades, but they believe they will fulfill to wean themselves off the dependency
*  on the dollar because they don't trust that you will use that weapon in a fair,
*  rules-based manner, that you're going to use it arbitrarily, capriciously, and for,
*  as you say, America's narrow selfish interests?
*  I feel as though if we're not careful, we will find that the thing that destroyed America's
*  dominant position in the world, America's ability to lead the world, to shape a rules-based
*  international system, was not some great external threat like China.
*  It was us.
*  It was the mistakes, the arrogance, the parochialism, the hubris.
*  All that combined will prove the much more potent weapon that undermined American hegemony
*  than the Chinese or the Russians.
*  This feels to me like the year that narratively, and probably in reality too, India began moving
*  towards superpower status.
*  I think that the estimation that it's now the most populous nation in the world was a kind of
*  big moment of pivot in how it was seen.
*  It is growing faster, say, than China.
*  It is much younger than China.
*  Modi is a very complicated and very checkered figure, but he does seem to have been successful
*  in getting things built in India at a really astonishing rate.
*  The digitization of a lot of Indian infrastructure and money and other things is a truly huge
*  accomplishment.
*  You've written some pieces about trips you've taken recently and reasons you have optimism there.
*  Give me a bit of your overview of what has shifted in India, such as their role in the
*  world is shifting.
*  I think that now with so much hype about India, I sometimes feel like I almost have to tell people
*  when they're going to go, just brace yourself, it is still a very poor country.
*  India's per capita GDP is still under $3,000 a year.
*  China's just give you a quick say.
*  Chinese economy is five times larger than India's.
*  There are a lot of things that have changed and a lot of positive things that have taken place,
*  but it's important to keep that framework in perspective.
*  I think what has happened in India is there has been a shift away from the old
*  statist state planning socialist economics that began in the early 1990s, that has been galvanized
*  in a way that only can happen in a democracy where you had alternations of governments so that
*  the opposition initially criticized it, then they came into power.
*  They now have implemented many of the same changes, have been two or three changes of
*  government and a certain amount of critical mass has taken place.
*  Many of the things that have been taking place in this government were planned in the previous
*  government and the Congress government.
*  For example, the digital infrastructure, Aadhaar, was actually an innovation of the previous
*  government, but has come to fruition under this one.
*  Could you just briefly explain what Aadhaar is?
*  The Indians innovated in a way that we could all learn something around the world from in creating
*  a biometric ID system where basically 99.9% of Indian adults now have a biometric ID,
*  they have a code, and what they've done is created a kind of digital ID that, for example,
*  I think the easiest way to explain this would be you're given this number at birth or
*  if you were an adult, you applied for it and they were able to get it to everybody.
*  If you want to open a bank account in India, it now takes 90 seconds.
*  So you can imagine all kinds of applications where the initial platform is government-owned,
*  open to everyone, and free, which allows you to build all kinds of new digital infrastructure,
*  businesses on it. Everything else that exists on that scale is a private monopoly.
*  I want to underscore how impressive an achievement that is to get a digital ID to 99.9%
*  of Indian adults in just a few years. So how do you assess Modi as a leader or manager,
*  having helped shepherd a massive project like that through?
*  Modi is an extremely competent manager. I don't think he is the kind of Thatcherite reformer that
*  people were expecting. That's not his mentality. When I've spoken to him, the sense I always get
*  from him is he wants real competence, real accountability, but he doesn't believe that
*  the big state-owned banks should be privatized. That's not his ideology. His ideology is I want
*  India to be strong, the Indian government to be strong, but competent, delivering, executing well,
*  and he's done that. He's done that remarkably well in physical infrastructure. He expanded the
*  digital infrastructure. Those two things, really, the two infrastructure booms, the digital side,
*  where India is really the world leader. India has the only billion-plus internet platform that is
*  not privately owned. Every other global billion-plus person internet platform, Google, Facebook,
*  are all private. What that means is that the whole Indian private sector builds on that public
*  edifice, which means it's a much freer, much less monopolistic, much more open, much more efficient
*  system. They're a real world leader in that. The second is the public infrastructure where
*  India has famously been terrible at, but is getting much, much better. You could see it.
*  For the first time when I went to Mumbai, I've been several times, but it caught my attention
*  this time. You look around and the number of cranes you see reminded me of Shanghai 20 years ago.
*  You're suddenly seeing that burst of infrastructure. All of that is lifting the country up.
*  Now, there is a reality, a dark side to some of this. Modi is very efficient,
*  and he's very skillful even on foreign policy. There is also a Hindu nationalist agenda
*  that certainly has left Indian Muslims feeling very dispossessed and persecuted. Christians,
*  in some cases, lower castes, the South, because of a certain kind of Hindu nationalism that is very
*  Hindi-oriented, Hindi being the dominant language in the North. A simpler way to put it, it's a very
*  particular nationalist project that leaves a lot of people feeling excluded. As Modi has consolidated
*  power, has his Hindu nationalism and that of his party gotten worse and more intense or moderated?
*  More intense, without any question. He's one of the most effective politicians I've ever seen in
*  my lifetime. He is really brilliant in some ways. The last phase of Hindu nationalism under the two
*  previous leaders, Advani and Vajpayee, they came across a problem which was it was seen fundamentally
*  as a kind of upper caste project, and the Indian lower castes who make up 50% of the Indian population
*  didn't really buy in, and that ultimately is what undermined it. Modi found a way to resolve that
*  tension in some ways by doing very clever alliances with lower caste parties. In some ways, by reminding
*  the lower caste that at the end of the day, they were all united as Hindus against the Muslims.
*  There's a certain bit of what Southern politicians used to do with working-class whites of saying,
*  you may be poor, but don't forget your social status is one step above you know who. There's
*  some of that going on. Part of it is they've run, they're very digitally savvy, very good at what
*  they do, but they have been able to as a result have freer reign on rewriting of textbooks,
*  rewriting of history, renaming of towns, ignoring or bypassing. Muslims have been in India for a
*  thousand years, and if you look at some of the symbols of the new India, the new Indian parliament,
*  you'd be hard-pressed to find many visual instances of that. There's an interesting
*  section in Rao's essay where she talks about how, look, India and China have this very complicated
*  relationship, and in fact there have been periods between them that have left Indian soldiers dead,
*  and they're somehow managing this competition, cooperation, and are very much in competition
*  for what they both seem to see as a leader of the global South. You talked about that as being
*  the key audience now, and India very much seems to see at least its great foreign policy goal now
*  as being understood to be the leader of the global South. Is that plausible, and how does
*  that competition relate to the role we want to play there? I think fundamentally the Indians don't
*  really want to be leaders of the global South because India is still basically not that interested
*  in the global role. China is. India is partly because it's much, in relative terms, much poorer,
*  still moving its way up the developmental ladder, but I've always thought that India reminded me
*  of America in the 19th century, which is this big, messy, chaotic democracy that's largely
*  internally focused. It's not that interested in what's going on in the rest of the world,
*  and to the extent that it is, it's largely focused on India's interests and very comfortable with
*  being completely honest about that very narrow preoccupation. If you read the Indian newspapers,
*  what is astonishing to you is you'd read these big, fat newspapers full of everything, and they're
*  still, for the most part, free even though somewhat intimidated. There's almost nothing about the
*  international world, and it's particularly true if you read newspapers in Hindi or a local language,
*  which is what the vast majority of Indians read. There's just very little interest in the outside
*  world. What is our direct relationship there shaping up to be? And noting to something you were
*  saying earlier about sanctions, before Modi became leader of India, he was under American sanctions.
*  So I get the sense of some internal consternation that we've not been able to hold India closer to
*  us during the Ukraine conflict. But there's also a real fear about what Modi represents in India.
*  So we've talked a lot about how American-Chinese relations have dissolved into something worse.
*  Obviously, we're not there with India, but does that seem like a relationship we are building
*  towards it being closer, or that we are on track for it to become more troubled?
*  No, I think ultimately the United States and India will have a closer relationship,
*  a deeper relationship, and one that will be enduring. Because the fundamental bonds that
*  will tie India and the United States together are going to be society-to-society bonds, not
*  state-to-state bonds. India is one of the two or three most pro-American countries in the world.
*  I think India, Israel, and Poland usually in the 70% plus say they like them, have a favorable view
*  of America. And it's palpable if you go to India. Every businessman wants to do business with America.
*  Every kid wants to find some way to get to America for education. The magnet of America is very
*  powerful. English is an Indian language, even though probably only 10 or 15% of Indians speak it.
*  But there is still the sense that it's, Indians are very comfortable in the world of English,
*  and so they can access America and American culture very easily. And by and large, America
*  still has a very attractive image for India. The complications come at the state-to-state level,
*  where there is, as I said, the Indians are more focused on India's interests, understandably so.
*  But I think those are also changing, because the Indians are realizing that the United States has
*  made a fundamental strategic decision. You could look at Bush's overtures to India, where he sort
*  of accommodated India on the nuclear issue in a way that the Indians had been asking for for three
*  decades, and finally the Americans did. You could see that as a one-off, but now you've had three
*  administrations basically all making the same overtures. So the arrow is moving in the direction
*  of closer and closer relations. And the second part is, I do think, as China rises more, this is
*  going to be a tough relationship for the Indians and Chinese. Right now, I mean, they want to play
*  exactly as you said, they want to balance the two. Part of that is economic necessity. And in this
*  regard, India is a metaphor for the world. So for India's growth, an economic relationship with China
*  is essential. But the Indians also know that they have a real strategic problem with China.
*  They have a border dispute that is very real and very live and has not been resolved. And they came
*  to blows literally a few years ago. And for that, they need the United States. And so they are going
*  to try to have their cake and eat it too. And they're going to try to balance these things.
*  But if I were to guess, the directionality will be that there will be more difficulty between the
*  Indian-India-China relationship, which means the India-U.S. relationship, even at a state-to-state
*  level, gets stronger. Let me end on a question here about American goals, which is, so right now,
*  Joe Biden has a Republican House. Looks like they're going to resolve the debt ceiling at the
*  moment. But he's not going to get a lot done through that House. It's possible. This is a
*  pile of what ifs on top of each other. But you can imagine him winning in 2024, but Republicans
*  keeping either the House or the Senate. And Biden, at his core, has always been a foreign policy guy
*  anyway. So what should his goals for America in the world be? If the rest of his term or terms
*  was actually to be defined by foreign policy, what set of accomplishments or reorientations
*  would you have told him to have or would make him to you a success?
*  I think he's done pretty well. So I don't want to make this sound like it's all criticism.
*  But I think that what he has to do is pursue successfully the completion of the policy that
*  he is following in Ukraine, make sure that Russia's invasion cannot stand, cannot be seen
*  as in any way legitimized or justified, that Russia remains isolated until if and when it would
*  decide to accept the reality of Ukraine as an independent sovereign nation, as its neighbor.
*  And that is a key building block to this larger project, which I do think is the fundamental one
*  for the US, which is how do you preserve, maintain, and enhance the rules-based international order
*  as American power becomes less and less the key dispositive factor? And to do that, we get to the
*  second task, which is we have to find a workable relationship with China. Because if we don't,
*  the rules-based international order will collapse if the two largest countries in the world, the two
*  dominant economies in the world, seal themselves off hermetically. That will lead to a collapse of
*  the globalization that's taken place over the last 30 years. The last time something like this
*  happened, and it's not even a perfect analogy, is Britain and Germany at the end of the 19th century
*  and the beginning of the 20th. Two very powerful countries, deeply connected economically, that
*  ended up in a geopolitical rivalry that essentially brought down the world. So the stakes are very high
*  in getting this right. And I feel like getting the right balance of some degree of deterrence and
*  some degree of engagement we have not yet gotten. And I would hope that he can work on that. The
*  biggest challenge he faces is not international in that regard. It's domestic. It's does he have the
*  space to try to develop a sensible, sane policy toward China? And as our conversation has shown,
*  it's complicated because there are elements where you need to push back, and there are elements
*  where you need real deterrence, like around Taiwan. But there are also areas where you need
*  to find some way to have a workable relationship. Then always our final question. What are three
*  books you'd recommend to the audience? I've been thinking a lot about this issue of nationalism and
*  how we really don't understand other countries and where they come from. And so the first one is
*  Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities, which is still, I think it was written in the early 80s,
*  but it's still this remarkable book that is able to explain why people are so nationalistic. Where
*  does it come from? He talks about how religion is at the heart of it. He talks about how modern
*  communications are a part of it. One of the parts I remember just thinking about our conversation is
*  the way in which he talks about how getting the news has replaced morning prayers as a kind of
*  binding act that keeps communities together. And I've been thinking about how getting our very
*  separate news nowadays has created these two very different, separate and distinct communities
*  in America. I sometimes think when people go to listen to, watch Fox, they're not watching
*  television. They're going to church. They're hearing the catechism. That's what they want.
*  That's what they need. And I'm sure you could make the argument on the other side.
*  And then I thought of two books that get it country. So I don't want to say the best book
*  on China, but a book that I read about China that I felt really conveyed some of China's past and
*  present very well was a book called Wealth and Power by Orville Schell and John Delury,
*  both great China scholars, great China watchers. And it's really the story of China from 1850 to
*  the present. It begins with the Opium Wars and roughly speaking with the Beijing Olympics.
*  I think it's a wonderful primer on China. And for India, there are so many, but there's a
*  wonderful short book called The Idea of India by Sunil Kilnani, a young academic of probably not
*  so young anymore, but it's wonderfully written. He writes gorgeously and there are these chapters
*  on India. And it just gives you a feeling for what it felt like to be this newly decolonized country,
*  free for the first time to chart your own path. And I think that that's,
*  you know, it's really important to think about how so many countries in the world think of
*  themselves that way, whether it's a Nigeria or South Africa, they've come into their own for the
*  first time, they are masters of their own destiny for the first time in so long. And that gives a
*  great impulse for them to not feel like they're being lectured to dominate it on where decisions
*  are being made for them. Fried Sikaria, thank you very much. This is always such a pleasure,
