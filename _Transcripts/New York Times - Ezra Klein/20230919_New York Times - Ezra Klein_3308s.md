# Boundaries, Burnout and the 'Goopification' of Self-Care
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [September 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql-zXf2_X7k)
*  From New York Times Opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  Hey it is Ezra.
*  I am on book leave this week, but we have the great trustee Macmillan Cottam sitting
*  in the chair.
*  She is a Times Opinion columnist.
*  She is the author of Lower Ed, The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy,
*  and the National Book Award nominee, Thicke.
*  She has been a guest on the show before, a host on the show before her episodes, no matter
*  where she is sitting, in which chair, are always some of my favorite.
*  So I'm excited to hear what she does this week, and I hope you enjoy it too.
*  And before we begin, one more thing today.
*  So I am doing the annual Jefferson Memorial Lecture for UC Berkeley, which I'm excited
*  about as a kid who grew up in California, idolizing and then getting repeatedly rejected
*  by UC Berkeley when I applied there.
*  And it's going to be the first time I try to work through the ideas of the book in public
*  with an audience, in conversation with someone else who knows what they're talking about
*  on these issues, Amy Lerman in this case.
*  And if you'd like to join and hear what I've been thinking about, you can.
*  Tickets are available at calperformances.org.
*  We'll put the link to the event page in show notes.
*  And again, that is October 5th at UC Berkeley.
*  Today's multibillion-dollar self-care industry has some surprising overlap with the radical
*  feminist idea that care could counter the ills of capitalism's self-interest.
*  It is now pretty hard to disentangle the radical roots of self-care from the consumerist way
*  we tend to go about it.
*  The idea of taking care of yourself is not merely virtuous.
*  It's become a cultural expectation.
*  The catch-22 of self-care becoming big business is that taking time to refuel, recharge, and
*  reconnect as self-care asks of us ends up feeling like just another productivity chore,
*  the kind that led us to burn out in the first place.
*  Pooja Lakshmi is a psychiatrist and the author of Real Self-Care.
*  She argues that self-care isn't about lighting a candle or making more time for yoga.
*  It is instead about internal work, which she outlines as four practices.
*  Setting boundaries, practicing self-compassion, aligning your values, and exercising power.
*  Lakshmi argues that when you practice this real self-care, you not only take care of
*  yourself, but you can plant the seeds for change in your community.
*  I invited Lakshmi on to the show to discuss why the easy, one-size-fits-all self-care
*  culture is both alluring and misguided.
*  Why setting boundaries is difficult, but absolutely critical to self-care.
*  And what tools might help us to take better care of ourselves and the communities that we are a part of.
*  As always, the show's email is Ezra Klein Show at nytimes.com.
*  Welcome to the show, Pooja Lakshmi.
*  How are you today?
*  I'm doing so well.
*  I'm so excited to be here, Tressie.
*  So I wanted us to have this conversation in part because, I don't know, I've got a little
*  beef with self-care.
*  Okay, so if I were to walk into your office and you started saying self-care to me, I
*  would go, I'm throwing up my hands at you, just so you know.
*  What might you say to someone like me?
*  Well, first I will say you and all my patients, right?
*  Okay.
*  All right, so it's not just me.
*  It's not just you.
*  I think that everybody either rolls their eyes to the word self-care is just kind of
*  like, there's this visceral sort of like, with my patients, it's like, how?
*  With what time?
*  Like, you're asking me to do more?
*  There's this almost like a rage that can come up.
*  Yeah, it sometimes borders on rage about what gets wrapped up in the self-care movement
*  and what's organized under the banner of self-care.
*  I don't like the cult of personality, of self-careness.
*  I think the sort of goopification of self-care and wellness as a personality-driven, influencer-driven
*  cultural phenomenon really distracts us from the fact that there is a lot of real, urgent,
*  moral pain experience that intersects with a lot of inequality, a lot of unequal experience
*  of the world that I just don't think self-care is designed to do anything about and worse
*  than being just neutral.
*  If it was just neutral, like you said, I'd just roll my eyes.
*  I don't think it's neutral though.
*  I think it's worse than neutral in some cases.
*  I think it actually can make it worse.
*  I think it can make that inequality worse by saying, if these things don't work for
*  you, it is your fault.
*  So when I look at this sort of like deification of a wellness influencer who, let me be honest
*  with you, very often wealthy, white, genetically gifted in a million ways, but the people who
*  around me who I think really need to be cared for are not those things, I get a little ragey.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I would say that the rage is productive because it's true.
*  And maybe taking a step back, one, I wish that I had a better word besides self-care.
*  And as I was writing the book, I thought of all these technical words like eudaemonia,
*  psychological flexibility, and everyone's like, that's not a book title.
*  And I did think that we needed a treatment of actually reclaiming self-care, like having
*  something that was going to appeal to the folks who go to gloop and maybe are coming
*  to understand that it's not working and also appeal to folks who are coming to this from
*  the social justice side and the side of understanding that we don't live in americocracy in America,
*  that white supremacy and what I've been learning to call it greedy capitalism makes us all
*  feel like we should be able to wellness our way into feeling better, but what we actually
*  need is things like paid parental leave, affordable, equitable health insurance, etc.
*  So how do you find a way to bring all those people into a framework that is accessible?
*  And so I stuck with self-care, even though the word or the term in itself can turn people
*  off or on.
*  So what I decided to do is kind of put it into two buckets, faux self-care versus real
*  self-care.
*  When I describe the faux self-care, I'm saying that that is what we're kind of rolling our
*  eyes at.
*  That is the essential oils, that's the turmeric lattes, the bullet journals, the whatever,
*  like you can insert any different.
*  Oh, the bullet journals.
*  I've bullet journaled so many times.
*  Okay, yeah, the bullet journals.
*  Yes.
*  So it's something you get from the outside.
*  It's something that you buy.
*  It's something that you do.
*  Usually your hopes are really high.
*  And I think actually the bullet journals are interesting because it's a specific, very
*  smart person that isn't going to fall for the essential oils, but you are going to believe
*  that if you get that right bullet journal system, that your whole world will no longer
*  feel like chaos and that you will be in control.
*  You are calling out my stationary addiction with a precision that I find disturbing.
*  But yes, okay.
*  The productivity panacea is, I think, the erudite version of wellness.
*  And I call all of that faux because it comes outside of you and it maintains the status
*  quo in your relationships and in our broader social structures.
*  If it's okay, I want to share a little bit about kind of like how I came to this framework
*  myself.
*  Please do.
*  So I'm a perinatal psychiatrist.
*  I specialize in women's mental health.
*  And when I started practicing graduated residency in about 2016, now I only take care of women.
*  But at that time, I was mostly taking care of women, most of whom were pregnant postpartum.
*  And one of the evidence-based ways to reduce the risk of postpartum depression is to get
*  four to six consecutive hours of anchor sleep in the postpartum period.
*  And we were taught to just say that, like, okay, get four to six hours of sleep postpartum.
*  And if anybody who's listening has either taken care of an infant or a baby or had one
*  themselves, you know, how am I supposed to do that?
*  People would love that.
*  No one is fighting that.
*  Nobody is fighting that.
*  The ability to sleep postpartum is hugely impacted by social determinants of health.
*  It's hugely impacted by, are you a partnered person or are you a single person taking care
*  of this baby?
*  Do you have grandparents who live close by?
*  Do you have the money to have a doula or a night nurse?
*  On top of that, do you have the education to understand your feeding decisions?
*  So that was kind of the beginning of me becoming a little bit radicalized about social determinants
*  of health, which still in psychiatry, you know, it's getting better, but that's still
*  a sore spot, you could say, especially given psychiatry's history.
*  And then the pandemic happened.
*  And collectively, I think a wealthier and more white swath of the population came to
*  understand things like the importance of childcare and why we needed to have things like paid
*  leave.
*  And that's when I started to see some of this wellness speak happening.
*  And I was just a little bit before the pandemic that I wrote a piece focused on women in medicine
*  called We Don't Need Self-Care, We Need Boundaries.
*  And it was really kind of getting at this like, when we're blaming the individual for
*  something like burnout, we're actually exonerating the broken social structures.
*  And so I guess what I'm trying to do with real self-care is thread that needle of like,
*  where does individual action fit into collective action?
*  And my take as a psychiatrist is that the two are intimately connected.
*  And I know we can talk more about that.
*  But I think that's a crucial thread of this whole new framework for thinking about self-care.
*  So let's talk about your piece for the New York Times Primal Scream series in 2021, which
*  explored the untenable burdens that the pandemic had put on working mothers in particular,
*  where for the first time, many Americans were living as some Americans had been living regularly,
*  dealing with the burden of childcare when you couldn't outsource some of that domestic
*  labor, for example, or trying to deal with outsourcing what you had been able to rely
*  on transportation, right, public transportation to manage or had been relying on your school
*  system to manage for you.
*  And disproportionately, that labor, the responsibility for managing it fell on women, on mothers.
*  And in your essay, you talked about the difference between burnout and betrayal.
*  What is the difference, the distinction you're making there?
*  So burnout, of course, there's a clinical triad to burnout, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization,
*  which basically means that you feel sort of outside of yourself, and then a decreased
*  sense of meaning with what's happening in your life.
*  I sum it up as the patient who comes in and has everything that they supposedly want in
*  their life, but then they look around and kind of have this feeling of like, well, is
*  this all there is?
*  Everything sort of feels empty, even though there's so much.
*  Collectively, we've decided to call that burnout.
*  But that's a very individualistic way of thinking about a condition that actually comes from
*  our social systems and the collective decisions that policymakers, lawmakers, governments,
*  corporations have decided to make, which you know much more about than I do.
*  But as I was preparing for this interview, I was just quickly glancing at the HHS website
*  and it says on the HHS website, burnout is a condition that is a result of workplace conditions.
*  So why do we call it burnout?
*  It's coming because of the environment.
*  And I think the other thing here is just the importance of the words that we use.
*  There is a researcher, Caitlin Collins, who writes about gender equity in parental leave
*  policies, and she has a book out where she interviews mothers in the United States, Italy,
*  Sweden, and she talks about how, where they have a robust social safety net, mothers talk
*  about their right for parental leave.
*  Whereas in the U.S., when someone gets maybe just like four weeks of leave from their employer,
*  it's a benefit.
*  But the difference in that, right, who is responsible for taking care of that caregiver,
*  in the U.S., it's always up to us.
*  And then even when everything falls apart, it's our fault.
*  And so when you talk about betrayal, how can self-care respond to that kind of betrayal?
*  Can it?
*  So my thesis is that instead of thinking of self-care as taking 15 minutes out of your
*  day to meditate or go for a walk, that we need to be thinking about self-care as something
*  that is threaded through every single decision you make in your life.
*  The small decisions and the big decisions.
*  So it's not a task to check off of your list.
*  It's actually something to embody.
*  There's different levels of this, for sure, especially if you're somebody who is in a
*  particularly demanding season of your life, let's say parenting or taking care of elderly,
*  aging parents, any type of caregiving situation.
*  You might be feeling like you're drowning.
*  So then you need just a life raft, right?
*  And there's a version of real self-care that is that life raft.
*  I call that sort of like 101.
*  And then maybe the 400 level of real self-care is like looking at these harder, big life
*  decisions like, what is my career going to be?
*  Do I want to have a partner?
*  Do I want to be a mother or not or parent or not?
*  How do I want to live?
*  Where do I want to live?
*  And when you deconstruct these choices, the framework that I'm suggesting is that there's
*  these four pillars we can talk about, boundaries, compassion, values, power.
*  When you deconstruct that and you decide to make choices in your life based on your own
*  values, not society's values, not culture's values, that that's actually deeply subversive.
*  And this, of course, builds on the work of Audre Lorde, bell hooks.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Black queer thinkers, like that's not an accident at all, that those were the folks who put
*  this work into our cultural conversation.
*  And I think that especially for women of color, for marginalized groups, for black women,
*  anybody who is, because of their identities on the outside, self-care, this version of
*  self-care, can feel actually even, I almost want to use the word violent, because it's
*  self-preservation, like Audre Lorde said, and there is a survival aspect to it.
*  The one last thing I want to say, just as we're sort of diving into this, is that I
*  think of the faux self-care stuff, if it's the yoga class or the meditation or the sound
*  bath or whatever, like those are all tools, right?
*  And sometimes the tools are helpful, sometimes they turn competitive, sometimes it's more
*  of just an escape.
*  The thing with the tool is that you can use it for a time-limited period, for a very specific
*  end, but real self-care is a principle.
*  It's something that can stay with you over the course of time, through different seasons
*  in your life.
*  And so that's why with the boundaries, the compassion, the values, and the power, it's
*  sort of about changing your thinking as to how you make decisions in your life, and then
*  seeing how that impacts other people as well.
*  All right.
*  So I have made a lot of those sort of like big decisions in my life here lately.
*  I have tweaked my professional life in some big and medium-sized ways to align with my
*  values and all of those things.
*  I sold my house and bought a new one to live in a way that felt more authentic.
*  I did all those big things.
*  And can I be honest with you?
*  Please.
*  It sucked.
*  I mean, the big decisions, you know, hard, like in the immediate, I can't say that I
*  think it felt particularly enjoyable.
*  I have to keep revisiting my notebook to remind myself, why did I do these things?
*  When I'm in the middle of the moving, in the middle of the reallocating my life, moving
*  all your stuff around, I have to find a new grocery store, I have to change all the things.
*  I just keep going, why did I do this?
*  Whereas, on the other hand, let me tell you what happens to me.
*  I was standing in the Williams Sonoma a few weeks ago, and, you know, Williams Sonoma
*  has everything organized and those little bins and the little vignettes, you know, how
*  they style the things.
*  And I'm standing in front of one and listen, I don't even light candles.
*  I'm not one of those people.
*  I don't like the strong, aggressive sense.
*  I'm not a big candle person.
*  And then yet there I was in front of one of those styled, organized little vignettes
*  that featured some candles.
*  And you know what I did?
*  You know what happened?
*  You know I'm the proud new owner of two Williams Sonoma orange essence something or the other
*  candles.
*  I don't even light candles.
*  So but in the moment that felt known and easy.
*  And so I understand why this faux self-care as ineffective as it is, it's a $10 billion
*  industry by some accounts.
*  And I can totally imagine, by the way, that we underestimate that.
*  I imagine we're not counting some things that should be included.
*  And by some estimations, a $10 billion industry, whereas I get the other stuff, ultimately
*  more important to my quality of life, my well-being in the short term doesn't feel as good.
*  What do we say about the effectiveness and the feelings of these things when you put
*  the faux self-care up against the real self-care?
*  How do we manage the emotions of those two?
*  One has got us by the emotions.
*  The other, I won't lie to you right now, I'm not feeling happy honky-dory about my aligning
*  with my principles right now.
*  I'm not feeling overjoyed.
*  Do you want my Dr. Laxman response or do you want my Pooja response or do you want both?
*  I would like both.
*  Okay, let me start with Dr. Laxman.
*  Everything that you're describing sounds completely reasonable and normal because you're in the
*  hard part of the transition.
*  You're in the work.
*  You're still in that space where you made those big decisions and it takes time to reorganize,
*  figure out where your grocery store is, unpack all the boxes, figure out what all the things
*  are, find your new favorite barista at the coffee shop that you go to, make those communal
*  relationships too and figure out who is Tressie in this new place.
*  Just based on what I've read of your work, I understand you to be somebody who cares
*  a lot about her environment and where you live, what your space is like, your physical space.
*  I do.
*  You're in that phase right now where you're having to curate that and it's a different
*  physical space.
*  Your nervous system, your brain, your body is doing a lot of what I call back of house
*  work, unconscious work of learning this new house, learning the new rooms, learning your
*  neighborhood and that's not available to you.
*  That's just running in the background.
*  That's my take.
*  It's not that you made the wrong choices.
*  It's that you're in the space of like you made the right choices but now there's still
*  work to do to reap the reward of said choices.
*  So doing the right thing doesn't always feel good immediately.
*  Correct.
*  And that's an important point because the whole concept of real self-care is based on
*  this term eudaemonic well-being as opposed to hedonic well-being.
*  So hedonic well-being is the like giant 600 calorie Starbucks milkshake that they're calling
*  a coffee.
*  That's pleasure.
*  It's a sugar rush or it's the absence of suffering.
*  Whereas eudaemonic well-being is a life that is built on meaning and purpose and when you
*  understand that your activities and your relationships and how you spend your time
*  and energy is aligned with what is most important to you, i.e. your values.
*  And the important piece there is that if you look up values in the dictionary, one of the
*  definitions is that it's a preference of what you decide to be most important in your life.
*  It's a preference.
*  Everybody's values are different.
*  And so real self-care is about making those choices aligned with what you actually care
*  about.
*  And the key there is then that's usually hard and it does not take away suffering in the
*  way that hedonic well-being can.
*  Right.
*  You did mention this in the book and I highlighted this part because I thought this was something
*  that was important, particularly in bridging this tension that I feel with self-care, which
*  is that it is homogenizing.
*  Right.
*  It does not account for the fact that for some people just by virtue of who they are
*  born in this world, there will be a degree of suffering for them.
*  There will be great joy too.
*  All lives.
*  No life is all suffering.
*  But one of the things that I struggle with with self-care is that it says that if you
*  have any suffering, you've somehow failed at self-care.
*  But for some of us, our life will be just by virtue of who we are.
*  If you are born queer in this world, in some parts of this world, there will be some suffering
*  visited upon you because of who you are.
*  If you are born disabled into an able-centered world, there will be a certain degree of friction.
*  There will be friction for you based on who you are.
*  And I think something I struggle with with self-care is the way it blames a person for
*  the suffering that is just part of being a human being for some of us.
*  And you're saying that there is a version of the self-care that you can embrace that
*  suffering and move through it anyway.
*  Yes.
*  You can acknowledge it and name it and take comfort and have your real self-care life
*  rafts to understand what that comfort is and still keep going when you're ready.
*  So I think that's the other piece here is that there's four principles.
*  Principles are fairly simple, but they're not easy.
*  Not easy, no.
*  This is not the type of thing where you read this book and you're like, all right, got
*  it, great, Pooja.
*  This is years and years of work, and it doesn't end either, I will say.
*  I've been open on Instagram about how after this book launch, I burnt out.
*  I wrote the book Real Self-Care, and then I promptly burnt out.
*  I'm going to bring a book and do that to you.
*  Which I've come to conceptualize that in my own therapy with my psychoanalyst.
*  It's because I've been interfacing with this very difficult system, which is the American
*  media economy.
*  And in every season of your life, you have to relearn what your values are, and it's
*  always shifting.
*  So I see that actually as an optimistic message in that this isn't something that you win
*  at.
*  It's something that you're constantly sort of practicing, because we're all changing.
*  We're always growing.
*  I think on that specific topic though of suffering and how certain people suffer more in America
*  than others, I think that's just such an important piece of this whole conversation.
*  And that's why with the fourth principle of power, it's like you need to know when, based
*  on what privilege you have, ways in which you've been oppressed, whether you should
*  be, or whether you want to be receiving help or giving help.
*  Are you taking or are you giving?
*  That depends on your identity.
*  That depends on temporarily what's going on in the world.
*  It's not static.
*  It's dynamic.
*  But that's a piece of this conversation that I hope is constantly threaded through.
*  And I share examples of patients in my practice who have stepped off the conveyor belt of
*  the consumer-oriented faux self-care and started setting the boundaries and understanding
*  their values, which led to changes either in their employer workplace or in their family
*  system.
*  My thesis though about this as a psychiatrist is that people are more motivated to change
*  when they're doing it because it benefits them.
*  And I know that's just a very pessimistic view of the world.
*  It is a view on human nature.
*  It's not untrue.
*  I mean, and to be fair, most of the people who come to see me are struggling with anxiety,
*  depressed.
*  Right, so there's significant struggles.
*  So you're trying to relieve these struggles, and you're making changes, personal changes,
*  to relieve that suffering.
*  But when it can be done in this framework of asking for what you need, speaking to yourself
*  with compassion, understanding what really matters, then we at least have a chance of
*  getting to collective action because you're modeling to your coworkers.
*  You're asking for what you need from your employer as opposed to staying stuck in that
*  commodified version.
*  And you never get over the hump when you're there is what you're saying.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So let's talk about your practical tools.
*  You've laid out these four pillars.
*  Again, I want to warn everybody.
*  These are tough.
*  As somebody who's dabbled in each, they are tough.
*  But let's start with boundary setting.
*  It is my favorite one, by the way.
*  I love boundaries the way I love getting extractions when I get a facial.
*  They hurt in the best way possible.
*  You got to do them.
*  I'm not sure anybody ever loves them, but you love having had them done.
*  So let's talk about boundaries.
*  How do you define them?
*  Because you define them in a very particular kind of way.
*  I imagine you to be somebody who's very good at boundaries, trusty.
*  I had to learn.
*  If I'm good at them, it's because it didn't come naturally at all.
*  Yeah.
*  So I, like you, was never terribly good at boundaries.
*  And the story that I tell in the book was after I graduated residency.
*  And I was coming on the faculty at GW, George Washington University in DC.
*  I'd just gotten my dream job.
*  It was a faculty position.
*  I was going to be supervising in our women's mental health clinic.
*  I was like this very green, bright eyed, bushy tailed.
*  And little did I know.
*  But my mentor took me out for lunch on my first day.
*  And she gave me this piece of advice.
*  She said, Pooja, you don't need to answer your phone.
*  You can let it go to voicemail, listen to what they want, and
*  then decide how to respond.
*  And that was just mind boggling to me because I had just finished medical school
*  in residency.
*  And in those days, you had the pagers.
*  Your pager would go off and it was like, you gotta respond right away.
*  And here was my mentor being like, no, you don't,
*  you'll just listen to the voicemail.
*  And that was an aha for me because I realized, the boundary is the pause.
*  And then you always have three options, yes, no, or negotiate.
*  So sometimes it was the front desk and they just had a bunch of paperwork for
*  me to sign and I could say, I will come around at the end of the day after I'm
*  done.
*  Or it's a patient who I know, if she misses one day of her stimulant,
*  her ADHD is so bad that she could literally lose her job or
*  get in a car accident.
*  I'm gonna put in that refill.
*  The pause is when I exert my decision making.
*  And that was eye opening to me because the reality is that
*  no isn't always accessible.
*  And no always comes with a cost, always.
*  And the lower you are in the caste system, the more cost there is.
*  And so-
*  Exactly.
*  The reality is many folks can't say no.
*  But you can always pause and you can think through these three options.
*  And then if you find yourself in a situation where you're like, I really,
*  I want to say no, but I can't because I might lose my job or whatever reason.
*  Then you bookmark that for yourself and you say,
*  Okay, one of my real self care goals or one of the things I want to think about
*  is a year from now, I want to be able to be closer to saying no than I am now.
*  Okay, so see, I like this moment because I have young women who come to me in
*  the profession like I'm sure you do.
*  And they want to talk to me about their career path and trajectory,
*  especially when they are women of color, first generation, immigrant women.
*  Any woman for whom this life has not basically been foretold for them, right?
*  And I say to them, saying no for you, as you just said, will always come at a cost.
*  And that flies in the face of every bit of feminist girl power advice they've ever
*  been given about negotiating salary and negotiating time off and
*  being a CEO and all of that kind of stuff.
*  I say no, you can't get away with that, right?
*  There are negative consequences with being interpreted as being bossy.
*  And I'm using the kind B word, I think we know the unkind B word.
*  But when it feeds into stereotypes of being angry,
*  being foreboding, that comes with a social cost.
*  And I say to them, it isn't that you shouldn't say no, but
*  that there is a certain power in knowing what the cost is of your no, that's all.
*  Just know the moments when you wish you could have said no, and
*  I think you've even said it even better here.
*  Maybe you can't say no, but at least now you're saying, you go,
*  now you've got a new goal.
*  Maybe in two years, the next time I have this pause,
*  I wanna be able to say no.
*  Yes.
*  That seems better to me than just feeling powerless.
*  Right, well because you've verbalized it for yourself, and
*  there's a clarity and an honesty, a truth to the no has a cost.
*  It always has a cost.
*  And if we're talking about personal life and family situations,
*  there's all sorts of drama that comes with no, right?
*  That's right.
*  And not everybody is able to, you decide, am I gonna put up with the drama?
*  Or am I gonna say no?
*  You can't have both.
*  And I think this is the thing about self care as it's usually packaged for us,
*  that there is a way to have boundaries and have everybody like them.
*  That's a fairy tale, is it not?
*  It's a fantasy.
*  And I think if we say, why do we all think that?
*  Who's to blame?
*  Certainly, what you were speaking about earlier with sort of influencer culture,
*  wellness, self help speak of as if there's some shortcut.
*  Like as if there's some way to live your life where you can just sort of pretend
*  that none of this messiness exists and you can just life hack your way,
*  self help your way.
*  Life hack, the life hack.
*  Okay, I also have beef with the life hack.
*  Yes, because so often, seriously, the life hack is just basically be more popular,
*  be wealthier, and be more impervious to consequences.
*  Yeah, sure, that's a great life hack, but it's not accessible to all of us.
*  Exactly, yeah.
*  It goes back to me to this history of deep in the self help culture comes out of
*  this genre or sub genre book of the leadership book.
*  And that you can create a win win for everybody.
*  But in real life, it seems to me, things are messier.
*  Sometimes there isn't a win win.
*  I think especially in family situations, you've got an example in a book where it
*  is a new young mother where she's trying to protect her child from the grandparents
*  coming over, the baby's sick.
*  There isn't a win win, right?
*  There is just a no.
*  But we've gotten our culture this idea that there's a boundary you can exert where
*  both sides will feel like they won something.
*  And if you couldn't find that win win that somehow you failed as a person.
*  And I think that's pretty insidious, especially to put that on women who I just
*  don't think the choices available to us just rarely give us a win win.
*  I completely agree.
*  And I think that just going back to sort of the facade that's put up,
*  that there can be this win win.
*  I think that it's a gendered facade.
*  Cuz ultimately, women in most families are the holders
*  of all of that messy emotion.
*  When there's a consequence, when mother-in-law is angry,
*  it's the wife who bears the brunt of that.
*  Right.
*  What I often tell my patients is when it comes to boundaries in family settings,
*  is you have to understand that there's two distinct processes.
*  There's the very technical operational bit of communicating the boundary,
*  like making the decision, doing the calculus in your mind, and
*  then saying, unfortunately, we're not gonna be coming for
*  Thanksgiving this year, delivering that.
*  Woo.
*  Right?
*  And then the other side, that the separate process is the feelings and
*  the backlash that's gonna come, the guilt that you're gonna feel.
*  And the crux is that the person you're setting the boundary with
*  cannot make you feel better.
*  They can't take care of your feelings.
*  If you keep going back to them to try and feel better, that doesn't work.
*  You need a third party, whether it's a friend, a therapist, a coach.
*  You need a third party to process those feelings with.
*  And then you have to trust that the relationship can withstand this tension,
*  and then there could be a repair.
*  I am totally guilty of trying to get the person to fix it for me.
*  I want them to accept that the boundary was okay.
*  Right, you want them to say, it's okay, trust me, I understand, I love you.
*  Yep.
*  And they probably will, just not right now.
*  Got it.
*  Okay, tell me about the glass and rubber balls.
*  So the second principle of real self care is compassion,
*  which I think about compassion based off of Kristin Neff's work.
*  Kristin Neff is a psychologist who's done a ton of research on self-compassion.
*  And it's basically looking at the way that you talk to yourself,
*  the conversations we all have in our minds.
*  It might not be actual words.
*  Sometimes it's just images or associations.
*  Women in particular are really, really mean to themselves.
*  There's a statistic in the book from a survey from Weight Watchers that
*  found that more than 50% of women say they have days
*  where they speak critically to themselves all day.
*  So what I'm talking about with self-compassion is that we look at
*  the conversations we have with ourselves and basically just be nice.
*  Be nice to yourself, stop being such a jerk to yourself.
*  And in that kind of section of sharing how to do that,
*  I talk about this situation where if you're a caregiver,
*  maybe of elderly parents, of little kids, it's not uncommon for
*  a patient to come in my practice and just be like, Dr.
*  Lexman, everything's a priority.
*  There's nothing that can give here.
*  How am I supposed to know how to fix any of these things or
*  to feel like I have the space to even read your book?
*  How do I have the time for any of this?
*  And so I thought of this quote, you need to know which of the balls that you're
*  juggling are glass and which are rubber.
*  And so often for my patients, everything feels like glass.
*  And so what I say is that when everything feels like a glass ball,
*  that means your body is in fight or flight.
*  You are at max capacity and
*  your prefrontal cortex cannot solution or problem solve.
*  So you can't actually make larger strategic decisions
*  when everything feels like a glass ball.
*  You have to remove yourself from the situation, even if it's just shutting
*  down your laptop, leaving your office, go for a walk, delete Instagram,
*  whatever you need to do.
*  You have to step away and let yourself get to a place
*  where you can actually feel like you can actually feel.
*  And then make decisions from there.
*  Allow yourself then to come back to, okay, here's the to-do list.
*  Which of these things can be rubber?
*  I just want to also kind of call out too, our to-do lists,
*  they're just delusional, literally delusional.
*  And I include myself in this.
*  I was feeling pretty personal.
*  I'm glad you included yourself.
*  I include, there's some warnings.
*  I'm like, I have ten things on this list.
*  There's no way.
*  You really can only have two, maybe two max priorities for a day.
*  Lots of people talk about this.
*  And so that's not anything new.
*  But it's more about when you decide you have to step out of that panic,
*  fight or flight mode.
*  So many of my patients are just constantly in that place.
*  And I guess, again, it's not our fault.
*  There's structural reasons why.
*  Yeah, speaking of structural reasons, the next pillar seemed to be the one most
*  directly tied to sort of the structural stuff for me.
*  And that is the pillar where you say align your values with your behavior.
*  This is the one, in me words, to me, that seemed to just be a concrete wall.
*  What does it mean to align your values with your behavior?
*  And can we get real with just how hard that is?
*  I don't think that it always needs to be something that, like,
*  nobody should look at this and feel like they need to take on something
*  that is larger than right-sized for them.
*  For example, I had a patient who took a leave of absence for her mental health.
*  She was caring for her elderly father and facing other stressors.
*  And through that leave of absence, advocated for herself,
*  set boundaries with her family.
*  Ultimately, when she came back, she had been very worried that she would be
*  penalized.
*  Instead, her employer was actually responded positively, which,
*  of course, is an exceptional circumstance.
*  I have a situation with a patient right now, without giving too much away,
*  where it's a little bit different, where it's like they're really looking at
*  the type of life they want to be living in raising their kids and
*  how much money they need.
*  And through this process, through thinking about real self-care,
*  they decided to move to a less posh neighborhood, downsize their house,
*  so that they could be in an environment that felt more authentic to them.
*  That did require that their kids are moving schools.
*  That's a sacrifice, right?
*  That's a big ask.
*  That's a big thing.
*  And by making this shift, they are signaling to their kids
*  that our value is not unchecked consumerism, right?
*  Our value is community to live in a space where we have neighbors,
*  where we go over to each other's houses, we hang out.
*  That's another version of real self-care.
*  I get that there is a link between individual actions and
*  ultimate collective action, but the link is pretty murky.
*  And you can do all of that and it not lead to that sort of collective action,
*  especially if there isn't some explicit effort to link it up
*  with other people's individual action.
*  You can imagine a scenario where one family does that,
*  but it again doesn't start a chain reaction because they don't link to other families, right?
*  And that doesn't sort of become a sort of collective action.
*  And so I do worry about feeling that individual responsibility,
*  that the people who will feel individually responsible are those people
*  who were already predisposed for feeling responsible.
*  And the people who weren't are just going to kind of do it and not sort of link it to collective action.
*  And we kind of find ourselves back in the faux self-care loop again, right?
*  With it not spreading to others, which I think is the ultimate solution for all of us.
*  We need more of this for more people, more of this for more of us.
*  My take is that if we stay on the level of a bubble bath, then there's no chance.
*  Fair.
*  For sure.
*  Yeah.
*  But if we move to a level deeper and some portion of our society continues to understand
*  that real self-care is about community, not consumerism,
*  that it will at least have a chance of moving us towards change.
*  Again, I'm not Pollyanna about this, though.
*  I said earlier that I think the best way to motivate folks to progressive action is to serve self-interest.
*  So I don't think that it's definitely not like a one-to-one type thing,
*  but I think it's better than the alternative.
*  But I think it's a valid question.
*  It's also the reason why I'm a psychiatrist and not a sociologist or an economist.
*  Fair.
*  Well, definitely don't be an economist.
*  And maybe even don't be a sociologist.
*  We probably have enough of both.
*  I will say one thing that I've been thinking about is, because I talk about the dialectic,
*  and you talk about the dialectic, too, in your work in Thick.
*  And I love the way that you described it as a dance, where you're constantly moving back and forth.
*  And of course, you conceptualize it in terms of race.
*  But I'm thinking of it here as we're always going back and forth between the individual
*  and the social.
*  And the two are always in this dance where both are true.
*  I think both are true, that the government is responsible for enacting top-down solutions
*  and individuals do have agency to make choices in their lives that can protect them and buffer them
*  and also spur potential change.
*  And maybe it is more hopeful than the reality.
*  I'm not sure.
*  But I think that's also part of why I'm doing the work that I'm doing.
*  I often have patients who, in the depths of burnout, they'll come to this and be like,
*  well, what's the right decision?
*  Should I do this job or that job?
*  Or is it that guy or this guy?
*  And I think when you're in that space, it's so important to understand that it's not one decision.
*  There's never one choice.
*  It's actually hundreds and thousands of small choices that get you to the place.
*  Because the place, you don't even actually know what the place is.
*  So you just have to keep doing the small things, the moving to the different neighborhood,
*  the making the small tweaks in your professional life.
*  And for me, I find that I go through that cycle probably every six months.
*  Not moving, thankfully.
*  Thankfully not moving.
*  But especially in terms of work, having to relitigate my boundaries and what my value
*  like the shifting sort of priorities is always changing.
*  That is an excellent, just rough at least rule of time.
*  I find that helpful to know because that is something I struggle with.
*  How often should I revisit this?
*  So a nice time horizon is nice.
*  Like, hey, it's been about a year since I've checked in with myself here on what I believe.
*  Do I still believe that?
*  You know, am I right?
*  Should this still be guiding my decision making?
*  Those are the types of questions that shouldn't be written in stone is what I think you're saying.
*  And it is nice to know, hey, every six months to a year, it's worth re-asking.
*  Yeah, and that's a place where you can really look at, like you can use those values words
*  and tie them to professional relationships, professional achievements and accomplishments
*  and kind of think about even in those six months, what am I most proud of?
*  And why am I most proud of it?
*  So it's not like a checklist, like a goal type of thing.
*  It's much more about the quality of what you engaged in, how you showed up,
*  why it matters and moving kind of from that place.
*  Now we ask all of our guests for three book recommendations.
*  You have three books you think we should read.
*  I do.
*  So the first two are current books.
*  And then the last one is a little bit of a classic.
*  The first book is called Living Resistance by Caitlin Curtis.
*  Caitlin is an indigenous poet and author.
*  I got to know her during my book launch.
*  Her book came out around the same time and we become friends.
*  Living Resistance is just, it's beautiful.
*  It's the type of book that you have by your bedside
*  and you read a chapter before you go to bed.
*  And then you wake up the next morning and you feel a little different,
*  just a little bit more connected to yourself.
*  She talks about these four different realms, the communal, the spiritual,
*  the ancestral, the personal.
*  Love it.
*  Living Resistance, Caitlin Curtis.
*  The second is by Lisa DeMore, The Emotional Lives of Teenagers.
*  Lisa's a clinical psychologist.
*  She's a friend.
*  I know she's been on the show.
*  And this book has been everywhere.
*  And she's awesome.
*  The reason that I mention it is because it's a great book for anybody
*  who's parenting teen kids or even little kids.
*  My son is 15 months and so I have a long way to go.
*  But I'm thinking a lot in terms of how do we support our teens
*  when we're talking about mental health and we're talking about real self-care.
*  How do we bring this into the next generation?
*  And then my third, N.K. Jemisin, The Fifth Season.
*  And I learned so much about oppression, colonialism, capitalism,
*  through her world building.
*  Because you see it in the characters and she does a brilliant job
*  about describing trauma in her female protagonists.
*  This is sci-fi fantasy.
*  But if there's any folks out there like me who, for whom sci-fi fantasy
*  is a little bit of self-care, then you'll love this if you haven't checked it out yet.
*  Hoosier, thank you so much.
*  Thank you. It was such a pleasure, Tracy.
