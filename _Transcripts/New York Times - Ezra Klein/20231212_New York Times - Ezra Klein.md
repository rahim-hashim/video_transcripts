# India Is Transforming. But Into What?
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov24MlxVB6o)
*  From New York Times Opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Hey, it is Ezra.
*  I'm thrilled today to have this fantastic conversation from my colleague at Times Opinion,
*  the co-host of Matter of Opinion, our cousin podcast, Lydia Polgreen, on one of the other
*  foreign affairs stories we've wanted to cover more and that deserves a lot of attention,
*  which is rising illiberalism in India.
*  Fifteen years ago, I moved to New Delhi as a correspondent for the New York Times.
*  It was a heady moment.
*  After years of uncertain growth, the country seemed primed for a kind of rapid economic
*  expansion that could vault its billion plus people out of poverty, just as China had.
*  But unlike China, India was a boisterous beacon of democracy, secularism and freedom.
*  India today has fulfilled a lot of the promises I heard when I was there.
*  It became the world's most populous country this year.
*  According to the World Bank, India's economy is one of the fastest growing in the world.
*  The country even hosted the G20 in September.
*  At the same time, there's been a clear erosion of democracy.
*  The state has stoked violence against religious minorities.
*  Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his administration have silenced both critics and independent
*  institutions.
*  And Indian government officials have been linked to two assassination plots against
*  Sikh activists in Canada and the United States, a pretty stunning diplomatic scandal that
*  puts new stress on India's relationship with the West.
*  So looking back in 2023, it's clear that India has risen, but not quite in the way we necessarily
*  expected.
*  So I asked Pratap Bhanu Mehta to walk me through what has happened to Indian democracy and
*  what it means for the rest of the world.
*  Mehta is a professor at Princeton University.
*  He has written widely on political theory and is the author of The Burden of Democracy.
*  He has a regular column at the Indian Express where he makes sense of Indian and global
*  affairs.
*  We talked back in early October, but I think his insights have only become more relevant.
*  As always, you can email the show at Ezra Klein show at NY times.com.
*  Here's Pratap Bhanu Mehta.
*  Pratap Bhanu Mehta, wonderful to be here with you.
*  Thank you very much.
*  It's wonderful to see you as well.
*  So it's been a while.
*  I lived in Delhi from 2009 to 2013.
*  In that time, you were really an indispensable guide for me in trying to understand the extraordinary
*  place that is India.
*  I'm just curious, how's life for you in India these days?
*  Well, there's never a dull moment in India.
*  I think that's for sure.
*  You know, it's a cliche about India that you always experience India as a paradox.
*  And I think the paradox of this moment is clearly India's political significance, economic
*  significance, cultural creativity is kind of as vibrant as ever.
*  On the other hand, the signs for Indian democracy are looking very ominous indeed.
*  I co-edited a big Oxford handbook of the Indian Constitution.
*  I have to say now when I go to class, I say I cannot tell you what the Constitution of
*  India is.
*  I cannot tell you if you go with a habeas corpus case to the Supreme Court, whether
*  it will be heard.
*  I cannot tell you when opposition politicians are being targeted by the government for tax
*  reasons, they will actually get the same fair relief from the Supreme Court.
*  So there is a sense of kind of dread about where this democracy is heading.
*  And I think we have to register both of those kind of emotions at the same time.
*  We're going to talk a lot about democracy.
*  It's a sort of line that we all hear.
*  India is the world's largest democracy.
*  It's been a democracy almost without interruptions since its independence.
*  That sort of uniqueness and boldness of the experiment.
*  I mean, you cannot visit India and not be profoundly moved by what is being attempted.
*  I mean, I'm wary of exceptionalism, but you know, I think never in human history has a
*  more ambitious experiment in coexistence through government by common consent been attempted.
*  So maybe a good place to start is just to ground us in some history.
*  Tell me a little bit about the history of India as a democracy and what India has had
*  to learn from being the world's largest democracy.
*  Look, I mean, Indian elections were probably more important to us than religions.
*  And I think they still remain.
*  I mean, there's a certain kind of vibrancy, a sense of diversity dealing with difference.
*  And I think India's nationalist movement's greatness was that it actually recognized
*  that the only way you could hold India together was if it was a product of widespread consensus
*  across religions, across communities, across castes, across classes.
*  I think that was, in a sense, I think it's instinctive grasp of what democracy is.
*  So one story you can tell about Indian democracy is that a lot of the constituent parts or
*  groups in society don't actually have to be democratic.
*  I mean, they can be internally sometimes quite intolerant.
*  They can be quite conservative.
*  And yet the balance of social power amongst groups, amongst castes, regions is such that
*  no single group or no single identity can hope to dominate without generating some kind
*  of resistance and backlash.
*  And we always used to say that India's politics was fated to a certain kind of centrism, precisely
*  for this reason, that there wasn't going to ever be a single identity force that could
*  command sufficient power to be able to govern India as a whole.
*  Well, in fact, the joke used to be that any party that governed India would have to look
*  like the Congress Party or maybe a better version of the Congress Party.
*  The Congress Party, the party that was started by Mahatma Gandhi.
*  And just give us a little bit of the history of the Congress Party.
*  Well, it was actually started by, I mean, officially it's founded as A.O. Hume.
*  But it's Mahatma Gandhi that actually gave the party its modern form.
*  He converted that party into a mass movement and really of extraordinary proportions.
*  What he managed to do, I think, quite significantly was not just forge a mass movement, but create
*  an imagination of modern India where each of its constituent parts would find its fullest
*  expression.
*  So, for example, he was a political genius.
*  Each state had a linguistic unit, which then became the basis for how India dealt with
*  the language question later on.
*  We created this brilliant compromise that there would be official link language English.
*  Aspirational Hindi as a kind of national language, but each state would be able to use their
*  own language.
*  So Tamil, Bengali, so on and so forth, Malayalam.
*  And it avoided the fate of so many post-colonial countries that experienced civil wars or got
*  divided on the basis of language.
*  And I think that really was an extraordinary political innovation.
*  It was an anti-colonial movement, but it was an enormously cosmopolitan movement in its
*  aspirations, founded in a much more authentic conception of rights, free expression, recognizing
*  individuality and dignity, and a pursuit of politics through nonviolent means, which is
*  not an insignificant contribution in the context of so many post-colonial movements.
*  I mean, India was one of the few nationalist movements that avoided both the extremes of
*  kind of left violence and the extremes of right violence.
*  And I think that Gandhi's extraordinary contribution.
*  You know, I think one of the remarkable things about the Indian nationalist movement when
*  I compare it to other nationalist movements is it is a movement for self-determination,
*  but it has very little resentment against the idea of the West.
*  In fact, I sometimes feel that our post-colonial movement now carries much more of a sense
*  of resentment than our anti-colonial nationalist movement did.
*  It's interesting because for me as a correspondent, I moved to India from West Africa.
*  I had been raised in East Africa and had spent my childhood in West Africa as well.
*  So I had this deep sense of India as this kind of beacon of what a large polyglot, multi-religious,
*  multi-ethnic nation could be.
*  And it's worth just dwelling for a moment on the violence and difficulty of India's birth.
*  It was born out of the partition of the British Raj.
*  It was a colony of Britain at the time.
*  Can you just talk a little bit about how these ideas came out of that experience of the horrors
*  of partition?
*  I'm glad you raised the issue of partition, which is, I think, one of the most decisive
*  events in modern South Asian history.
*  India always thought it could be the exception to the European experience.
*  The process of the formation of nation-states everywhere, including in Europe and North
*  America, has been an extraordinarily violent, exclusionary and majoritarian movement.
*  There is almost no exception to this, I think.
*  And the aspiration of the nationalist movement was that, look, can we forge a new kind of
*  identity that doesn't repeat the mistakes of Europe?
*  Now partition was the first shock to this aspiration because in some senses, partition
*  was premised on something like the European idea of a nation-state.
*  There must be some single identity that actually binds the nation.
*  In the case for the demand for Pakistan, it's the idea of a kind of Muslim homeland in South Asia.
*  And since that, Pakistan actually came as a deep shock to that nationalist project.
*  I mean, you know, that image of Gandhi, in a sense, grieving at independence because
*  he saw India's independence as a failure.
*  It was born out of violence.
*  He saw it as a rebuke to that extraordinary project that the nationalist movement had
*  tried to create.
*  And it would have been very easy for India's founders to have said, look, India has been
*  already divided on religious grounds.
*  Let us complete the task of partition, declare India a Hindu state.
*  And yes, Muslims can live here, but we should be absolutely no doubt that the logic of partition
*  is actually the creation of a Hindu state in India.
*  And Muslims are the largest minority, but they're very significant, right?
*  I mean, what is the percentage proportion between Hindus and Muslims in India?
*  It's a very sizable minority.
*  You're looking at about 200 million people.
*  And I think what is remarkable is that despite partition, they actually, I think, continued
*  with that project of trying to create an Indian exceptionalism.
*  I think Jawaharlal Nehru, he was India's first prime minister and really in some sense the
*  founder of India's democracy in some ways.
*  I think the two deep ideas that he had, if you read his books like Discovery of India
*  and stuff.
*  So one was this idea of India as a palimpsest of all of the world's civilizations.
*  India is a Hindu country, it's a Muslim country, it's a Christian country.
*  It's an Asian power, but it's also an enlightenment country.
*  And that phrase he uses over and over, India is a palimpsest on which every civilization
*  has left a mark.
*  But a palimpsest which is that transformed each of those civilizations and made it into
*  its own.
*  I think that was a kind of deeply philosophical and I think profound orientation to India.
*  But second, I think at a more practical level, that India has such cross-cutting diversity
*  that if you privilege any basis of identity as the basis of nationhood, what you risk
*  is a great deal of violence, expulsion and bloodletting.
*  So I think in a strange way, partition actually just reinforced the idea.
*  Even what remains of India cannot flourish and survive unless it says we are going to
*  create a kind of nation-states that's very different from anything else that has happened
*  in the world.
*  Yeah, you invoked Nehru and I think one of his most famous and historic speeches is the
*  Trist with Destiny speech.
*  What do you think was India's Trist with Destiny and what is it today?
*  Right.
*  So the first and most important one was actually overcoming poverty and the extraordinary levels
*  of human misery and oppression that this society had internally experienced, particularly through
*  the institution of caste.
*  This is the sort of the undergirding system of people being born into a particular community
*  and that forming a social hierarchy.
*  Absolutely, a social hierarchy which you could not escape, a social hierarchy that was in
*  some senses deeply oppressive and particularly if you were at the bottom of that social hierarchy,
*  Dalits, Untouchables as they used to be called in those days, the bottom 20%, it really would
*  rank up there with slavery.
*  I mean we can always kind of nuance these comparisons intellectually, but there's just
*  no getting around what a moral abomination it was.
*  So in some senses the Indian state was embarking for the first time on this project of saying,
*  look, we need a model of development that can overcome the tyranny of this compulsory
*  identity that is called caste.
*  And so I think this idea which is embodied in the Indian constitution of the idea of
*  liberty, equality, fraternity in conditions that otherwise were deemed to be inhospitable
*  to them.
*  India gained universal suffrage at a moment where it was one of the poorest countries
*  in the world.
*  So if you look at levels of economic development at which countries get universal suffrage,
*  India gets it at the lowest level of economic development.
*  It was one of the least educated countries in the world.
*  And yet this enormous hope that through constitutional politics you could actually overcome
*  the scourge of poverty and at least social inequality.
*  I think the second thing that I think is very remarkable to me about the Trist with
*  Destiny speech in the Indian constitution and the preamble to the Indian constitution
*  is God knows Nehru and the founding generation fully understood that God, history and identity
*  matter to Indians.
*  I mean you can't imagine this country in some senses without a deep religious and spiritual
*  engagement, without deep contestation over history and identities proliferate.
*  I mean people wear them on their sleeves.
*  But that in order for these identities to flourish, in order for that cultural heritage
*  to come alive, it was very important that the political social contract not be burdened
*  with the weight of God, history or identity.
*  So people don't feel that they have to be benchmarked to a single identity or access
*  of loyalty.
*  So yes, God will flourish, but Gods will flourish.
*  I mean, you know, India's idea of secularism wasn't that religion would be marginalized.
*  It would be that it would be put on a basis of individual freedom such that all communities
*  and all groups could enjoy it.
*  Just looking at the past few years and you see the way in which India is sort of meeting
*  this kind of trist with destiny, right?
*  India is by most accounts now the most populous country in the world over outstripping China
*  the economy, the GDP expanded by 7.8% last quarter.
*  India hosted the G20, a very important gathering of global leaders.
*  And you're seeing India kind of step up to its place on the global stage, but it's happening
*  at a time when the sort of internal contradictions and tensions is I think really coming to bear.
*  So maybe this is a good time for us to turn to Narendra Modi and spend some time talking
*  about who he is, where he came from, and maybe focus on a couple of key moments.
*  And I think one key moment for me certainly is the 2002 riots in Gujarat.
*  So I think the three most important things to bear in mind about Narendra Modi, who is
*  an extraordinary political figure.
*  I mean, just as an analytical proposition, you don't have to endorse his politics to
*  recognize what a transformative figure he has been.
*  So the first most important thing is that he is a member of and had much of his political
*  and cultural upbringing in an organization called the RSS, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak
*  Sangh, which was founded in the 1920s.
*  And the RSS has had one core objective, which is the creation of a Hindu political consciousness
*  that India has been subjugated to what they call a thousand year period of slavery.
*  They regard even Mughal India, for example, as a period of slavery.
*  And their political commitment is to create a form of Hindu consciousness and identity
*  such that Hindus are never subjugated again and have a political straight, an instrument
*  of their own.
*  So this straightforward political objective has been, Narendra Modi is in a sense, guiding
*  star.
*  Everything he does in some senses flows from realizing this political objective.
*  Even economic policy, right?
*  Making India an economically developed nation is in some senses part of an instrument to
*  achieve this objective.
*  I think the second thing about him, which I think in the Indian context is remarkable,
*  is he's a completely self-made politician and leader.
*  Biographically, he's from India's less privileged castes and had absolutely no privileges,
*  either economic, social or political, that usually mark the political careers of so many
*  Indians.
*  And what this allowed him to do was two things which are really quite central to his success.
*  One is to produce a kind of instinctive identification with large masses of people.
*  The political party represents the Bharti Janta Party used to be accused of being largely
*  an upper caste party of sort of privileged traders, privileged Brahmins.
*  He single-handedly transformed that party into a party that has a much wider social
*  base now.
*  He managed to run and still runs on this plank that what kept India back, particularly over
*  the last 20, 30 years, was the fact that India was being ruled by something like a
*  dynastic Anshan regime.
*  The Congress Party was dominated by the by the Nehru-Gandhi family in some ways.
*  And so when he speaks of corruption, he's not just referring to the fact that there
*  might have been sort of monetary corruption.
*  He's actually just referring to the fact that Indian democracy had acquired the
*  characteristic of being something like a closed club.
*  And he has in some senses opened the gates of this politics to ordinary Indians, to
*  languages they speak.
*  So, for example, he's a very gifted orator in Hindi.
*  The BJP is much more comfortable in the vernaculars than the Congress Party is.
*  So he could represent that old complex as a privileged elite with a narrow social base
*  against whom his kind of persona stands.
*  And I think the third thing about him, which I think goes back to his days in Gujarat,
*  is in Gujarat, he acquired the reputation for both being an effective administrator on
*  the one hand. And the second thing, of course, he was known for is his conduct during the
*  2002 Gujarat riots.
*  What happened in these riots?
*  This is very contested.
*  And I think one has to go back to the late 80s, early 90s, where the Bharatiya Janata
*  Party, which Mr. Modi represents, launched an agitation for reclaiming what they called
*  was the site of the birthplace of Lord Ram, where a mosque had been built in the 16th
*  century. And the BJP's demand has been that this should in some sense be returned to the
*  Hindus. And they created a mass movement.
*  Now, what that mass movement did was that it, in a sense, created pockets of Hindu-Muslim
*  tension all across India, because in some senses, these rallies were quite aggressive.
*  They really were signposting the fact that a Hindu movement was arriving to claim India
*  for Hindus.
*  One of the results of that mass movement was the tearing down of the Babri Masjid.
*  This mosque in Ayodhya.
*  Yeah.
*  Ayodhya. Now, this movement was actually trying to collect volunteers and collect actually
*  literally bricks from different parts of India to take to Ayodhya as a kind of symbolic
*  gesture of kind of building, you know, these be used to build temple.
*  Now, as this movement is going on and tensions are on the rise, a train in Godhra was set on
*  fire. And roughly around 50 of these volunteers, the volunteers that were going to Ayodhya were
*  killed. This immediately set off a set of now what the BJP would call retaliatory violence.
*  This violence was directed at Muslim residents in Gujarat.
*  Absolutely. And about 2000 people died. And it was absolutely gruesome violence. I mean, it
*  really is just, you know, it's just it's just very hard to describe.
*  Yeah, neighbors set upon neighbors.
*  Neighbors set upon each other. Now, his role. So there is a range of positions in this. One, of
*  course, holds him directly responsible for instigating the retaliatory violence. There was
*  a commission of inquiry and for what it's worth, that commission of inquiry absolved him of that
*  charge. I mean, that's again for what it's worth. But we do know in India that if the state is
*  committed to stopping violence, it can actually stop it fairly quickly. You know, you can bring
*  the law enforcement agencies out. The army can be called out. And I think the political question
*  mark over Narendra Modi, whatever you think may be the direct instructions he may or may not have
*  given, is that this was clearly a massive abdication of responsibility on part of the
*  Chief Minister of the state. This violence could have been stopped. And there is no excuse, no
*  matter how deep the passions run, no matter how widespread the desire for revenge is, there is
*  absolutely no excuse for the scale of violence that actually took place in Gujarat. The fact that he
*  was accused of formatting this violence by the Congress Party, he had been denied a visa to the
*  United States, as you know, till he became Prime Minister. I think that convinced him that the
*  entire world is a kind of gigantic conspiracy out to get Hindus. And that conspiratorial mindset is
*  actually very, very central to the BJP analysis thinking about the rest of the world. That somehow
*  there has been this global conspiracy since, you know, I don't know, maybe 900 AD, to keep Hindus as
*  a political community down. And the fact that people were accusing him of formatting this
*  violence was just another element in that conspiracy. So it was completely turned on its head.
*  And I hate to say this, but there is a sense in which I think there was a significant number of
*  Hindus who began to subscribe to this much more radical and aggressive message that the BJP was
*  going to be much more aggressive in protecting Hindus, if you want to put it charitably, or
*  aggressively targeting minorities. I think that message went out loud and clear from that
*  Gujarat experience. The sense that violence can pay long term dividends for Hindu nationalism as a
*  movement. It became a central plank of the BJP. I mean, till 2002, there always used to be this sense
*  that you could not win a national election only with the votes of Hindus, that somehow you'd
*  always have to stitch a broad coalition. I think Narendra Modi managed to convince his party,
*  and that has been their electoral strategy, that they could come to power only with Hindu
*  votes. And in fact, you could actually increase your share of Hindu votes, consolidate a Hindu
*  constituency, if you were to clearly send a signal that you were going to politically marginalize
*  Muslims.
*  But then 2009, there's another election. This is the moment that I land in India. And I think
*  you're right that this fire has been lit around Hindu nationalism. But at the same time, there was
*  this sense that India had a teetotalling economist as its prime minister, that India's
*  tryst with destiny is about to be fulfilled. It felt like a moment. And the thing that I remember
*  particularly was a sense that these sectarian divides felt much less alive. One of the first
*  stories that I did was I actually went to the city of Ayodhya, where the Babri Masjid mosque was.
*  And it was striking to me how the temperature at that place was basically just room temperature.
*  And you had this, you know, kind of too busy to hate India moving forward, you know, we're joining
*  the global economy. And that was very much the vibe when I got there. And there was a sense that
*  Narendra Modi, no chance he could be prime minister, the guy can't even go to the United States.
*  And the BJP seemed like they were nowhere. And, you know, Congress was ascendant. And boy, were we
*  wrong. So walk me through what happened. How did Modi go from being an international pariah to prime
*  minister of the world's largest democracy?
*  I think, you know, as I said at the beginning of the show, this sense we had of a kind of India faked
*  it to a certain kind of centrism actually made all of us complacent that a force like Narendra Modi,
*  or at least a very radical Hindu nationalist ideology could never be dominant, or if it even came to
*  power, it would have to ally with other kinds of groups to moderate its stance. So I think what
*  happened post 2009 is I think a bunch of things. So the first is, of course, the 2009 financial crisis
*  globally, right, which is a pivotal moment in democracies across the world, because India was
*  growing at 8%. And it was a nice place to be you're growing at 8%. The state was getting enough
*  resources to begin to build out slightly more ambitious welfare state, something Narendra Modi
*  has then sought to accelerate. And yet, what the 2009 financial crisis did, at least in the Indian
*  context was two things. One, it actually did expose the corruption at the heart of that growth regime.
*  You know, lots of projects kind of suddenly seem unviable to people. And there is an anti corruption
*  movement, which kind of paved the way for saying, look, this old regime, this ancient regime headed
*  by the Congress, this coalition government, it may have done us some good, but now it is a corrupt,
*  torturing regime. India has a moment, an opportunity here, but it is actually frittering
*  it away because of a weak government. In fact, the slogan that Narendra Modi used was policy
*  paralysis. So 2014, he ran largely on this plank. I'm going to overcome this paralysis. I'm a strong
*  decisive leader. Look at my record in Gujarat. And he ran against plutocracy. But plutocracy in
*  this very generalized sense, you know, this is a kind of old corrupt ancient regime. And like,
*  I think, politics elsewhere, it was the implosion of the alternative, the internal implosion of the
*  Congress party that created much more of the space that somehow it had lost this will to fight,
*  this will to govern. There was very little communication, very little mass mobilization.
*  It just had lost, you know, all the kind of ABCs of political mobilization.
*  The second thing that I think happened, and this may take some explaining, but I actually do think
*  it is important. So the BJP's primary base is in North India. It has now expanded. So it is a
*  genuinely pan-Indian party, but its core political support is drawn from North India, and particularly
*  the largest state in North India, which is Uttar Pradesh, which is, you know, the size of Brazil,
*  I think, in terms of population or something. In North India, English does remain a language
*  of privilege. So Hindi and the vernacular languages are important, but they are the
*  languages of culture. They are the languages of the past. They might be the register of emotions
*  in some ways. You know, we might kind of curse each other in Hindi.
*  But the language of the future is English. If you want to get access to social privilege,
*  and if you want to get access to the production of knowledge, and particularly future knowledge,
*  right? Science, technology, medicine, law, you have to have English, or at least be fluent in it.
*  And our education system actually produced large masses of students, young people,
*  who are kind of linguistically stranded. They're linguistically stranded in the sense that they're
*  fluent in the vernaculars, but actually will find it difficult to compete in the cutting edge of
*  English, that we have a form of language competence that does not make us full participants
*  in this privileged social structure. What it has done is that it made it very easy to mobilize
*  this kind of resentment against an entrenched elite. When you were in Delhi, you went to Khan
*  Market a lot, I'm sure. I mean, it's a great place to hang out with bookshops, coffee shops.
*  Restaurants, yep.
*  Mr. Modi frequently uses this phrase, I stand against the Khan Market gang.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a brilliant piece of political communication, because everybody instinctively recognizes
*  that it refers to the narrow social privileges of an elite. And so I think what he was able to tap
*  into, apart from his kind of caste identification, is that I actually stand for something that is
*  much more authentic and connected. Our heritage, our languages do not just have to be about the
*  past. Now, quite what he does with his education policies is another matter. But I think that sense
*  of, I think, resumpti more, that India was being governed by a small, exclusive elite.
*  I think he managed to give that voice and expression very powerfully. And because of his
*  uniqueness in some sense as a politician, his own biography, his own extraordinary communicative
*  skills, I think he was in a sense able to tap into that. And I think more than the specifics
*  of Hindu nationalism, it's this particular trope that I am rescuing India from a small
*  elite out of touch that I think still resonates very powerfully.
*  Yeah. And I think it's not just an elite that's out of touch. It's an elite that is looking
*  outward. And there's something about the sort of return to the vernacular that's saying,
*  no, no, no, the real strength of India lies within. And we will engage with the rest of the
*  world on our own terms. So Modi gets elected in 2014. His first term, to my mind, as I followed it,
*  seemed mostly to be focused on these economic issues. There were some cultural issues, focusing
*  on hygiene and toilets. I mean, what a lot of people maybe don't know about India is that the
*  lack of clean water and access to toilets is a huge public health issue, holding people back in
*  a lot of ways. There were a lot of just sort of fundamental development issues that he focused on.
*  But it seems to me that it wasn't until he was reelected, that his government was reelected in
*  2019, that you really started to see the clause come out. And you've written, I think, quite
*  powerfully on this, on the government's policy in Kashmir, because there was a very sharp change.
*  And I'll quote you, the BJP thinks it's going to Indianize Kashmir. But instead, what we will see
*  is potentially the Kashmirization of India. So tell me about what happened in Kashmir,
*  and what do you mean by that idea, that Kashmirization of India?
*  Right. Gosh. So, you know, Kashmir has historically been one of the deepest failures of Indian
*  democracy. So when India became independent, there was a whole bunch of princely states,
*  that had to take the decision of whether to accede to India, whether to accede to Pakistan,
*  or potentially even remain independent. I mean, most of them weren't viable, but
*  at least in theory, that was an option. Now, Kashmir was one of the last holdouts. It had a
*  Hindu Raja, but its population was majority Muslim, but interestingly, one of the most kind of
*  secularized and led by a radical leftist Sheikh Abdullah. And Pakistan decided to force Kashmir's
*  hand by actually invading Kashmir. And India said it could help only if the Maharaja signed an
*  instrument of accession, joining India, and Kashmir joined India. Pakistan never recognized
*  legitimacy of that extension. And there's a long history of Pakistan fermenting active,
*  terrorist and militant violence in Kashmir for much of the 20th century.
*  And just to put a fine point on it, I mean, this Himalayan province, you know, one of the most
*  beautiful places on earth, I've been there many times, and it's extraordinary. But you're talking
*  about a flashpoint between two nuclear armed countries, right, Pakistan and India. And it's
*  a very explosive situation. I mean, I just wanted to underscore how sort of tender and fragile the
*  status of Kashmir is. It is an and unfortunately, I think it was also a failure of Indian democracy.
*  Kashmir also had special status in the Indian constitution. According to the terms of accession,
*  the Indian state was going to conduct Kashmir's foreign policy, there'd be, you know, a minimum
*  set of common laws, but Kashmir was supposed to have a great deal of autonomy in terms of governing
*  its own affairs. But unfortunately, I think the Indian states relationship with Kashmir got
*  securitized very early on. I mean, every political protest, every kind of political dissension was
*  being looked at through this prism of, you know, are they really kind of court secessionists in
*  place, right? Kashmir is the only state in India where there was a sense that the elections were
*  not entirely free and fair. It's constantly interfering in elections. It is putting Kashmir
*  internally under a state of siege. Pakistan is actively in some sense of formating violence
*  and terrorist groups. Even when it was open for tourism, it became an immensely militarized place
*  about half a million troops guarding kind of Kashmir security checkpoints. There was a sense
*  of great sense of siege about Kashmir. Yeah, and it's, you know, this place, there's this
*  beautiful lake and people stay in houseboats and you've got the amazing Himalayan skyline.
*  But there was this sense that, you know, you were stopped and asked for identification constantly,
*  you know, flying in and out of the airport. You know, you felt a sense of surveillance.
*  And this is for an outsider, for my many Kashmiri friends and particularly journalists,
*  this sense of being surveilled and being, you know, having your rights curtailed was really,
*  really powerful. And so what did Modi do in 2019?
*  So one of the RSS's planks, the organization that Modi belongs to, was that if you actually
*  wanted the integration of Kashmir into India, Article 370 had to go. That would be a constitutional
*  statement that Kashmir is a part of India, just like any other part. And it would also send a
*  signal to Pakistan that we are not even thinking that this is disputed territory. I mean, just
*  forget about it. And this has been part of BJP's manifesto forever. I mean, so at one level,
*  there was no surprise. I mean, I think we just never took them literally in some ways, right?
*  So what they did was they basically revoked Article 370 and on the grounds that Kashmir
*  needs to be a state like any other state in the Indian Union, no special privileges.
*  And the government's view was we are going to restore administrative order. So we are going
*  to clamp down on militants. We are going to attract investment by creating law and order.
*  And to be honest, it has had mixed results. I mean, you know, the government can claim that
*  at least the outbreak of violence has not been as bad as many had feared. Many of us had feared,
*  many of us had feared actually. But it still remains the case that there are still pockets
*  of militancy and there is still a significant clamp down on civil liberties, on reporting on
*  Kashmir, on the free movement of journalists in Kashmir. If you're a journalist in Kashmir,
*  you really have an impossible task ahead of you. Even outside of Kashmir, most Indian mainstream
*  papers will not carry stories critical of what's happening in Kashmir. Now, what I meant by the
*  Kashmirization of India, I mean, partly, of course, you know, it's a column, it was sort of a kind of
*  provocation. But unfortunately, I think the grain of truth in this was that what the government was
*  trying to demonstrate in Kashmir was that a strong repressive surveillance state was going to be
*  the more effective means of integrating Indian citizens into the state, rather than a faith in
*  democracy, pluralism and open society. And many of the practices that we experimented on in Kashmir,
*  detailed surveillance, preventive detention, the idea of expanding the limit of who you hold under
*  suspicion, that those practices of the state would become much more generalized and be replicated
*  elsewhere in India. You can see that in a state like UP, where the Chief Minister is very popular,
*  but one of his characteristic modes of governance is a form of vigilante justice. If you are
*  suspected, and the key word here is suspected, and particularly if you're a member of the minority
*  community, of let's say, even participating in a protest, your house can become in bulldoze
*  without due process. So this arsenal of repression and looking upon the citizens as objects of
*  presumptive distrust, that's really what the Indian state did in Kashmir at the end of the day.
*  That is becoming a much more generalized practice of governance, I think, across India.
*  It's interesting because I'm always trying to kind of check my own assumptions here, because
*  you know, the people that I talk to, my friends, they're journalists, they're people who are in,
*  you know, kind of activist, you know, communities or politics adjacent. And, you know, the report
*  that I hear from them about sort of the general mood across India is very much what you're
*  describing, this kind of Kashmirization. Muslims have felt the sort of the first brunt of it,
*  but anybody seeking to live a different kind of life or to report honestly on what's happening
*  in the country and, you know, is ultimately feeling the sharp end of that stick. But the
*  thing that you sort of balance that up again is that I think really striking popularity of
*  Narendra Modi. And, you know, my friend, the journalist from here Sharma wrote in 2019,
*  after Modi's party was reelected, he said, We do not live in Modi's India, we live in Indians India.
*  And the reason so many Indians adore Modi is because he represents their preferred
*  conception of the Indian state and the Indian nation. And it reminded me of something that
*  you wrote, which is that tyranny can be the stepchild of democracy, which is a great paraphrase
*  from Plato. This theory that, you know, you could build a majoritarian project on the votes of
*  Hindus alone, it's clearly working. No, it is clearly working. So look, you know, if you want
*  to take a hopeful story, and the opposition will keep reminding you of this, they will keep saying
*  something like 60% of Indians still don't vote for the BJP. In a first past the post system,
*  parliamentary system, roughly about 38 to 40% of the world can actually get you a pretty dominant
*  majority in parliament. But there is a lesson in that. And the lesson is that, like everywhere in
*  the world, that ethnic majoritarian forces have come to power. It has largely been because the
*  forces arrayed against them have failed to credibly unite on a coherent platform. So the center and
*  left in India splits, you know, 20 different ways. But I think more deeply, I think, and I actually
*  do think the cultural transformation that I see of India is truly astonishing. Large sections of
*  India's elites in particular, right, those who are most powerfully placed to resist this,
*  I think their ideological conversion to this project is actually quite significant. If you look
*  at the Indian media landscape, it's one thing to say that the media does not criticize government,
*  maybe they fear reprisals. Often the owners of media might fear reprisals. But what you are
*  seeing in the Indian media is actually something much more than simply complying with the state.
*  It is actually creating and disseminating structures of hate, fully funded by the most
*  powerful echelons of Indian capital. I mean, this is going way beyond we fear the state and we will
*  not criticize it. There is almost like a positive investment in that information order, day in and
*  day out. I mean, it's actually unbearable to read many of the regional papers these days. English
*  media, you see somewhat little less of it, but it's there, or on television media, for example,
*  right? The Indian Supreme Court, really an extraordinary puzzle. We used to say in 2009,
*  the years you were here, that the Indian Supreme Court had become one of the most powerful courts
*  in the world. In fact, the criticism of the Indian Supreme Court was it pretty much did what it wanted,
*  meddled in, whichever issue it wanted, far beyond its jurisdiction or competence.
*  One of the most disappointing things has been the near abdication of the Supreme Court
*  in protecting basic civil liberties. The extent of it is so mind-boggling that you've got to think
*  that deep down there is some kind of allegiance to this project that is actually surfacing. It's
*  not simply held together by fear of reprisal. So for those of us who grew up in India, I have not
*  seen an elite discourse that so openly participates, revels in disseminating hate as I see at this
*  moment in India, not even at the height of the temple movement in the 1990s. The one most important
*  function of the leader is to be at least able to articulate a norm. This is right, this is wrong,
*  this is what we accept, this is what we don't. It's a measure of how far India has come,
*  that the leadership is not only unwilling to articulate this norm, it is often dog-whistling
*  about targeting minorities. We had this extraordinary scene in parliament where a senior
*  leader of the BJP in parliament said something of one of the few Muslim MPs in parliament
*  that you could not even say with censored speech. It's literally the kind of thing you'd
*  expect out of a text called Mein Kampf. In the Indian parliament, senior BJP leader,
*  he has been rewarded. You are now empowering a set of people, an ideology, and sending out a
*  signal that if you want to move up in this political system, you have to engage in acts
*  of hate or violence or commit yourself publicly to this project. I mean, this is completely
*  unprecedented. This is, it's a shattering of the norms.
*  It's really striking to me that we've gotten to this place now where you have India kind of
*  emerging on the global stage as such a critical player because there are big, powerful countries
*  like the United States, but also others, that are seeking India to take its place on the global
*  stage as a counterweight to China. What recommends it for that role is precisely the fact that it
*  sees itself, it describes itself, and is seen by others as a secular pluralistic democracy.
*  There's this tremendous irony that at precisely the moment you're seeking a democratic counterweight
*  to China, the obvious candidate for that role, its democracy is, from what we've discussed, seems
*  really deeply imperiled.
*  No, it isn't. And if you look at India's projection abroad, one of Mr. Modi's favorite tropes is,
*  India is the mother of all democracies. I mean, that's the kind of tagline and a kind of guru to
*  the world. But it is a performance. This government's diagnosis, and Trump's election may have something
*  to do with it, the way in which the kind of world changed post-Trump, is that there is not going to
*  be any penalty for India's actions domestically. And to be fair to them, their reading of the
*  international system has been just right. That somehow they think in the end, the United States'
*  strategic imperatives, rather than its imperatives in democracy and pluralism, will actually trump
*  their engagement with India. By the way, it's also happening in a moment where the exemplarity
*  and authority of almost all democratic countries around the world is also at its lowest.
*  I can't remember a time where the prestige and authority of American democracy was so low.
*  It's almost even in this state, many Indians are willing to say, oh, now we can talk back to the
*  United States. So there is no exemplarity and authority left to that idea in the international
*  system, I think. And this goes to one of the fundamental tenets of Hindu nationalism as an
*  ideology. Their diagnosis of India's success and failure is very different from, at least mine,
*  possibly yours and most of the world's. The two figures in Indian history they hate the most,
*  they revile the most, are Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi. I mean, this is a party that
*  openly celebrates Mahatma Gandhi's assassin. And there is almost this sense of embarrassment they
*  have that somehow this whole talk of nonviolence actually made us weak. It made us less respected
*  in the world. America took Pakistan more seriously because it created trouble in the international
*  system. We never were taken seriously, which again, I think is a pretty bizarre reading of
*  history actually. But it is a kind of political style whose core is defined by a certain kind of
*  fascination with violence and aggression. The other has to be created in order for this
*  Hindu existential crisis to actually reap political dividends. So it can be Muslims,
*  it can be secular intellectuals, it can be liberals, it can be George Soros, God knows why
*  George Soros in the Indian context, but right. They are too, huh? Oh, absolutely. I mean,
*  in fact, today the BJP has just put out a big political ad which basically describes the
*  Congress party as a film being produced by George Soros. So in that sense, the core of
*  sensibility rests on the idea of a kind of perpetual Hindu victimhood.
*  One place where you sort of see this playing out, and obviously this has been very, very big in the
*  news, is Canada's assertion that India assassinated a Sikh activist who is a Canadian citizen in
*  Canada. There's a lot of questions about what exactly happened here. If India is actually
*  responsible for this assassination, it's a huge violation of international norms.
*  But even if they weren't directly involved in it, it almost seems to play the game that India
*  wants to play on the global stage to create the perception that India has that capacity
*  and will act as it wishes on the global stage without deference to the kind of quote unquote
*  rules-based order. Yeah, no, I think that's exactly right. But what is striking sitting in
*  India looking at it is how much the political machine of the BJP is trying to milk this
*  occasion. It's almost like we didn't do it, but we are capable and it's been a great thing.
*  But if we did.
*  It's truly actually astonishing how much it has been fed into part of that narrative of
*  bravado in some ways.
*  It's interesting. There's another narrative that I hear sort of bubbling along underneath all of
*  this, which is I think there's a sense in the United States that perhaps we were mistaken in
*  how we managed our relationship with China. The idea that you bring China under your wing, you
*  integrate them into the global economic system, you see prosperity rise, you create the linkages
*  that make it harder for a country to kind of go off on its own. I think there's a feeling, well,
*  was that a mistake? Did we sort of create the conditions for China to become this incredibly
*  powerful country? And now it's of course, our main geopolitical rival. And you hear in some
*  quarters a question of like, are we doing the same thing again with India? And I wonder what
*  you make of that question.
*  I have to be candid. I think sitting in Asia, you know, this idea that somehow you could structure
*  a global development process that shuts out countries like China or India just sounds so
*  remarkably full of hubris and presumption. And, you know, I mean, the fact that China's
*  integration into the global economy actually lifted millions and millions of people out of
*  poverty, I don't think is a human achievement to be sneered at. But the idea that India and China
*  could be shut out in some senses from being competitors or participating in the global fruits
*  of science, technology development, frankly, I don't think it's even practical terms on.
*  In fact, that kind of assertion plays exactly into the hands of nationalists everywhere.
*  I mean, even those who don't support authority in governments, you know, when they hear a
*  statement like, oh, actually, what the United States is going to do is structure the world
*  economy in a way in which it retains primacy forever. It doesn't matter whether you're
*  authoritarian or democratic, right? You're not going to particularly push. So I actually think
*  it I actually think for the United States is on sake. I think I think this way of posing the
*  question is I think a slightly self-defeating one. I mean, the easiest way of reinforcing the
*  conspiratorial mindset of Hindu nationalism is to actually prove what they've been always saying
*  that the world is out to get in and is to place it under siege. And also, I think particularly at a
*  moment in world history where it's very hard for the United States or any other country to pull
*  this policy off as if this were a matter of principle and conviction. I mean, how many
*  authoritarian regimes are you going to exclude, not do business with, right?
*  So I actually think if you make people's development and democracy a tool of geostrategic
*  politics, you end up doing both geostrategic politics and the cause of democracy and development
*  great harm. I mean, many Indians often talk about this, you know, should the Biden administration
*  be doing more? You know, they don't have to roll out the red carpet. They can say the truth sometimes.
*  I mean, it can be a perfectly candid relationship. But I don't think there is an option but to engage
*  with India. And I think both in some senses will be better off it. I also strongly believe that
*  not to take away anything from American power, but I actually think the United States' role in how
*  Indian democracy develops will be miniscule at most. This is a struggle that Indians will have
*  to undertake internally. I mean, maybe most of us are still complacent. The way in which violence
*  is being enacted in Indian democracy still feels like in drips and dribbles. I mean, most of us can
*  still go around our daily business thinking this is not going to affect us. But most of us still
*  hope and still believe, I mean, otherwise we won't even be having this conversation, that yes,
*  the signs look ominous for Indian democracy. But at some point will come a threshold where ordinary
*  Indians begin to say that, look, this is not us. Now, what that threshold is, is an open question.
*  But I actually do believe that that threshold will be reached and you will find Indian society
*  reacting appropriately. I think that is a very good and hopeful note to perhaps wrap up our
*  conversation on. And as a person who loves and admires India very much, I very much want to
*  believe in that prognosis. And next year is an election year. It'll be interesting to see what
*  happens. I think most people think that the BJP will come back. But lots of things can happen.
*  The world spins on. So at the end of every episode of the Ezra Klein Show, we ask our guests to
*  recommend some books. Could you recommend three books that our listeners could benefit from to
*  understand India democracy in the world better? Okay, so I'll go with a couple of unusual choices.
*  One which is not recent is I actually still think reading V.S. Naipaul's India trilogy,
*  which is now one book, I think he and partly because he himself was such a complicated and
*  many ways awful character. I think he actually saw the moral psychology of what's happening in
*  various Indian social movements, I think much more clearly than I think many liberals and
*  constitutionalists have recognized this theme of India thinking of itself as a wounded civilization
*  and now trying to kind of claim something of that itself through this path of violence and
*  Hindu nationalism. Besides, I mean, he's a wonderful writer to read. I think the second book
*  I'd pick is a recent book by Shiv Shankar Menon. The title is India in Asian geopolitics,
*  but it's really about India's place in the world. Incredibly well written, but also somebody who's
*  both a deep historian and has had the benefit of having a ringside seat. I think it's the single
*  best book on India's place in the world. The third I would recommend, I mean, this is a sort of
*  a slightly more kind of quirky recommendation, is a book by Snigdha Poonam called The Dreamers.
*  This is a book that kind of captures the craziness and the contradictory textures of
*  this kind of young, educated India, right? I mean, some of those linguistically stranded people we
*  talk about, the IT hackers, you know, the would-be Indian idols, I mean, which is the Indian version
*  of American Idol, the music program. It does have kind of enough of those sort of quirky life
*  biographies to make it an interesting introduction to India beneath the surface of
*  these large themes of kind of politics and economics.
*  Those are all wonderful, wonderful recommendations. Pratap Banu Mehta,
*  thank you so much for being with us. Thank you so much and good luck to both our democracies.
*  Amen to that.
*  Yeah.
