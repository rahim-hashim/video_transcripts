# ‘This Is How Hamas Is Seeing This’
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzUxxY2sYys)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Here are two thoughts I believe need to be held at once.
*  Hamas' attack on 10-7 was heinous, was murder on a mass scale, was unforgivable.
*  And also that Hamas needs to be understood on its own terms, in terms of how it sees
*  itself and how it presents itself to Palestinians.
*  And I'd say there's been an organized effort to push that latter project away.
*  There's been this tendency, particularly after the attacks, and particularly in Israel and
*  in the West, to say that Hamas is simply evil.
*  Netanyahu refers to it as Satan.
*  That all Hamas wants is dead Jews, that it cannot be negotiated with and it must be destroyed.
*  And at the same time we see with the hostage exchanges and the multi-day ceasefire that
*  Israel does negotiate with Hamas.
*  That there are things Hamas wants and that, at least as of yet, Hamas is nowhere near
*  being destroyed.
*  Nor is it near being discredited.
*  There's a poll from early November by the Arab World for Research and Development group
*  that found about three quarters of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank said Hamas is playing
*  a positive role.
*  About the same number supported Hamas' attacks.
*  Yes, the poll had a small sample size, and yes, it's hard for obvious reasons to do representative
*  polling among Palestinians right now.
*  But the early evidence is that Hamas' standing has improved, not collapsed, among Palestinians.
*  So I asked Tarek Bacony on the show.
*  Bacony is the author of Hamas Contained, one of the best books on Hamas' rise and its
*  history and its changes, I should say.
*  Hamas today is not what Hamas was 10 years ago or 20 years ago.
*  Like all organizations, it shifts.
*  He's done really extensive work interviewing members of Hamas and mapping the organization's
*  beliefs and structure.
*  And it is worth saying here that to take what Hamas wants seriously does not reveal necessarily
*  a path forward.
*  I think sometimes there's a lazy way of thinking that says to understand something will always
*  allow you to reconcile it.
*  I think this is quite the opposite, actually.
*  I think this conversation shows in many ways why it is so hard to find a path forward.
*  And as I've said before, not everything in this episode is going to be easy to hear or
*  comfortable to hear or something you will agree with or something that I agreed with.
*  That's not the way to listen to this.
*  This is about trying to see a side in this war and in this conflict more clearly.
*  And so to see the whole conflict more clearly.
*  I should note here that we talked on November 30th, shortly before the ceasefire fell apart.
*  Also going to note before we start the episode that we are doing another Ask Me Anything
*  for the end of the year.
*  You can send your questions to Ezra Klein show at NYTimes.com.
*  Tarek Baconi, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  So I want to begin with Hamas' founding in the late 80s.
*  So at the time, you have the PLO as a central organization representing Palestinians.
*  Hamas emerges in part as a critique of the direction the PLO is taking.
*  So what was the disagreement about?
*  The reasons for Hamas' establishment really was because there was mounting pressure within
*  the Muslim Brotherhood that the conciliatory approach that the movement had taken within
*  the Palestinian territories towards the Israeli occupation needed to change.
*  And that the Muslim Brotherhood as an Islamist organization focused on social welfare issues
*  needed to move into a more confrontational role to challenge Israel's occupation of the
*  Palestinian territories.
*  So that was really the driving force for the Muslim Brotherhood transforming into what
*  became Hamas.
*  But that transition, that political transition, happened alongside a historic concession that
*  the PLO was doing, which was to recognize that Israel exists as a state on 78% of the
*  land of historic Palestine, and that the PLO's ideological commitment to armed struggle for
*  the full liberation of Palestine was now going to be replaced by a decision to lay down
*  arms and engage in a diplomatic process that would result in the establishment of a state
*  of Palestine on the 22% of the remaining land.
*  Now that concession was something that Hamas from the get-go fundamentally opposed, and
*  the opposition for Hamas was grounded in an Islamist ideology that it believed the land
*  of historic Palestine from the river to the sea was an Islamic waqf, an Islamic endowment
*  that has to be maintained with its full integrity in perpetuity.
*  So it was ideologically opposed to the idea that the land of Palestine can be partitioned.
*  So one view that Israelis have of Hamas is that what it wants, the only thing that it
*  will accept is the end of the state of Israel.
*  The end of the state of Israel is any kind of Jewish state, the end of the state of Israel
*  on that land.
*  And that underlies a belief that there's nothing really to negotiate with Hamas, that Hamas
*  is not a political actor that they have really anything to talk about with.
*  Are they right about what Hamas wants?
*  Are they right that the demands here are fundamentally irreconcilable?
*  I don't think the demands are fundamentally irreconcilable.
*  I think it depends on the diplomatic process and how that unfolds.
*  Now Hamas itself, over the course of its history, has offered various concessions at different
*  points and in different ways that suggests that the movement is aware of the need for
*  a political settlement and is open to negotiations.
*  The narrative that you've just outlined, which is the Israeli narrative, is one that means
*  that none of these political interventions can be taken seriously.
*  So just to say one example, when Hamas was democratically elected and it entered into
*  the body of the Palestinian Authority, the movement ended up offering a whole host of
*  concessions in discussions directly with Fatah to try to achieve a reconciliation agreement.
*  And several were achieved.
*  The most important was achieved under Saudi custodianship.
*  And that was aimed at creating a unity government committed to the creation of a Palestinian
*  state on 67 lands.
*  And in a concession by Hamas, they said, we will put any future referendum on any peace
*  agreement to the Palestinian people.
*  That was the Mecca agreement in 2007.
*  And the international community led by the US commenced a regime change operation that
*  was aimed at making sure that Hamas would be removed from power, to the point where
*  a civil war happened and Hamas took over the Gaza Strip.
*  But let's just say that this narrative that the movement wants the destruction of the
*  state of Israel and therefore there's no point in negotiating with it, was one that was used
*  against the PLO before Hamas.
*  And that was the reason why the PLO, before Hamas, as a secular nationalist party, was
*  also accused of being a terrorist organization that was not open to any diplomatic maneuvering
*  or intervention.
*  And that was partly the reason why the PLO ended up laying down its arms and deciding
*  to commit a diplomatic process.
*  And that still doesn't lead to Palestinian statehood.
*  Hamas is a movement that grows out of that context.
*  It sees what that historic concession does.
*  It sees how it's received and it sees how it doesn't necessarily lead to the outcome
*  that the PLO had expected.
*  I do wonder about the difference between watching something fail and helping something fail.
*  Hamas launched its first suicide bombings during the Oslo process.
*  You've described that as an effort to act as a spoiler.
*  Later on, when there were more serious negotiations, the second Defada began and that destroyed
*  the Israeli left, it destroyed the part of the Israeli political system that did want
*  to create negotiations.
*  So it seems to me that Hamas has often acted in a way not to simply stand back and say,
*  well, we've seen that fail, but to try to make things fail, to try to harden Israeli
*  hearts to convince them that if they kept up in negotiations, that if they actually
*  came to a deal, they would not have safety as part of that deal because Hamas would not
*  allow them to have safety.
*  And so I wanted to get your understanding of that kind of difference between learning
*  a lesson from failure and trying to ensure failure.
*  That's a really good question.
*  And of course, Hamas actively tried to undermine the Oslo discussions throughout the course
*  of the 90s.
*  It was grounded in its belief, not only at the time that partition was something that
*  was ideologically incompatible with the movement and that the PLO had conceded on inalienable
*  rights for the Palestinian people by conceding the establishment of the state of Israel,
*  but also that the negotiations themselves, had they succeeded, would never meet the minimum
*  demands of the Palestinian people.
*  Now it's important to note here that Hamas isn't opposed to negotiations.
*  Hamas is committed to the idea that negotiations could only serve the Palestinian rights and
*  the Palestinian struggle if they come from a position of strength.
*  And this is fundamental to understanding how the movement thinks, that it believes that
*  the only way concessions could be produced, the only way that actual liberation for Palestinians
*  can be achieved is if Palestinians negotiate from a position of strength.
*  So in Hamas's role as a spoiler, it's believed that it was undermining negotiations that
*  were fundamentally meant to undermine the Palestinian struggle.
*  It was vindicated in that, in the sense that now we understand that the Oslo Accords was
*  unlikely to produce a Palestinian state the way Palestinians understood what that state
*  would be, with actual sovereignty.
*  The Oslo Accords were always grounded in the idea of autonomy, that Palestinians would
*  be autonomous, that they would self-rule or govern in their enclaves under an overarching
*  structure of Israeli rule.
*  That's all to say that Hamas actively tried to undermine that process alongside other
*  actors and ultimately was vindicated in its belief that actually the Israelis were not
*  negotiating here in good faith.
*  One reason that it is, I think, so unwise to be optimistic about any negotiations is
*  that there is a spoiler veto.
*  But I want to key in on that idea of vindication because you've talked at times about Hamas
*  and the Netanyahu government being in what you call the violent equilibrium, an equilibrium
*  where they would functionally negotiate through rocket exchanges and Israeli reprisals, but
*  that it was a kind of equilibrium.
*  They were acting in relationship to each other and responding to one another.
*  And I understand them as in a kind of political equilibrium too.
*  The Israeli far right benefits from Hamas.
*  Hamas is one way that they get elected.
*  They say, look, the left is full of idiots.
*  They don't understand the nature of the security threat we're facing.
*  And Hamas empowers that far right and so looks more legitimate to the Palestinian people.
*  I understand the argument that they're vindicated, but it's because of almost a collusion, it
*  often seems to me, between them and the kinds of figures you're talking about on the Israeli
*  right.
*  Obviously not a collusion happening in meetings, but a collusion between the hardliners on
*  both sides making themselves seem more necessary to their own side by empowering the others.
*  Well, yes and no, in the sense that of course Hamas is actively trying to undermine a peace
*  process that it thinks is detrimental to the Palestinians.
*  And in doing that, it has in some ways a sense of allyship with Israeli forces that are also
*  trying to do the same.
*  So Hamas is strategically playing a spoiler game very effectively, as are others on the
*  Israeli side.
*  And it's of course a counterfactual to say, could a Palestinian state have been produced?
*  We don't know that.
*  And multiple factors play the role in undermining the possibility of that happening.
*  But I would also caution against the idea that this is something that only the Israeli
*  right is benefiting from.
*  There's no real indication that even Rabin, who is celebrated as a dove of the Israeli
*  political establishment, considered the possibility of a Palestinian state and the provision of
*  the Palestinian inalienable rights, which includes fundamentally the right of return
*  of refugees, in a way that would meet the minimum Palestinian demands.
*  Even before Hamas was an effective spoiler, the Israeli left was negotiating in bad faith.
*  It was continuing the settlement building expansion and the fundamental demands of the
*  Palestinians were being pushed further and further away.
*  So this idea that there could have been a political process that the Israeli right or
*  Hamas was undermining and in the absence of those, there could have been this utopia or
*  this idealistic version of a negotiation between the PLO and the Israeli left is also a fantasy.
*  So of course, the kind of spoiler tactics that Hamas utilized was co-opted and used
*  and opportunistically leveraged by Benjamin Netanyahu in the 90s and his ilk and those to
*  the right of him.
*  But I don't think we should overestimate the impact that this had in terms of undermining
*  the peace process. If there was genuine effort to achieve a partition in a way that would
*  meet the minimum Palestinian demands and the historic concession of the PLO, then there
*  might have been a Palestinian state.
*  But I think every indication points to the fact that actually Israel wasn't in whatever
*  political government actually really pursuing partition or recognition of Palestinian sovereignty
*  in the way that Palestinians understood it.
*  We're going to come back to right of return, but I want to get there through Hamas rather
*  than sort of going back into the peace process.
*  And I want to do it this way, which is to look at Hamas's 2017 charter.
*  To the extent people I think have heard about a charter from Hamas, it's their original
*  charter which straightforwardly calls for the destruction of the state of Israel.
*  But in 2017, they released a new charter.
*  And I want to look at that in some detail.
*  So give me a bit of background of your understanding of what this document is, how it comes about,
*  why it comes about, and whether we should look at it as a consensus view of the way
*  Hamas sees the world and what it wants and would accept.
*  So the charter can be seen in many ways.
*  So this is the last major move that the leader of the movement Khalid Mishal does on his
*  way out before he's replaced in democratic elections internally within the movement by
*  Ismail Haniya.
*  And in one way, it can be seen as an effort by Khalid Mishal to draw a line in the sand
*  and say, you know, this is what Hamas is today.
*  This is what Hamas is at the time that I leave it.
*  This is what its political demands are.
*  It could be seen as an effort by Khalid Mishal to reach out to the international community,
*  to policymakers, even to Israeli interlocutors and say, you know, this is an opportunity
*  for diplomatic and political engagement.
*  And it can be seen as an effort to try to sway the spectrum of views within the movement
*  itself.
*  Obviously, Hamas is a multifaceted organization, it's very diverse, and there's a whole range
*  of views internally.
*  And this could also be seen as an effort by Khalid Mishal to sort of push or nudge the
*  movement in a certain direction.
*  But for those of us who have studied Hamas and who have been watching it for a while,
*  there was nothing really new in the charter in 2017.
*  It really just was a place in which everything the movement had been articulating to date
*  was sort of put to paper.
*  I do appreciate your point that there are many ways you can see it, because in some
*  ways I feel as you read it, as I read it, you can feel that effort to satisfy different
*  constituencies all at once.
*  So I want to read to you a pretty core part of it and try to understand how you understand
*  it.
*  The charter says, quote, Hamas rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation
*  of Palestine from the river to the sea.
*  However, without compromising its rejection of the Zionist entity and without relinquishing
*  any Palestinian rights, Hamas considers the establishment of a fully sovereign and independent
*  Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital along the lines of the 4th of June, 1967,
*  with the return of the refugees and the displace to their homes from which they were expelled
*  to be a formula of national consensus.
*  Also, the document also says, there shall be no recognition of legitimacy of the Zionist
*  entity.
*  How do you read that?
*  What is being described there?
*  So several things are happening here.
*  The first is that this is really the concretization of a position that Hamas began taking during
*  the second intifada, but really formalized in its political platform when it ran for
*  elections in 2005, 2006, which is to say that the movement is willing to accept the creation
*  of a Palestinian state on the 67 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital and to limit
*  its military engagement and its resistance against the Israelis to the settlement enterprise,
*  to the military occupation.
*  This is a political move by Hamas.
*  This is a strategic move in which it's signaling an opening for a possible diplomatic resolution
*  if there was a serious effort to engage with that.
*  Now, two things are happening with this decision to not recognize the state of Israel.
*  The first is a political game, and again, this is where the PLO's experience becomes
*  important, that where the PLO offered recognition, it ended up negotiating from a position of
*  that it played all its cards without any kind of commitment from Israeli interlocutors or
*  international interlocutors that they would hold Israel accountable to offering recognition
*  of Palestinian statehood.
*  So that's a political game, but it's also an ideological game.
*  And the ideology here is to your second point around refusing to recognize Zionism.
*  And this is fundamental because this is something that is not limited to Hamas.
*  This is something that Palestinians writ large would agree on, which is that Zionism
*  was and is an illegitimate movement that allowed the colonization of the land of Palestine
*  to settle Jews in Palestine and create a Jewish homeland and a Jewish state.
*  And it's really important to understand this, that even in this counterfactual reality of
*  a two-state solution and negotiations to produce Palestinian statehood, that would have been
*  from the Palestinian perspective, a recognition of a historical fact that now the state of
*  Israel exists.
*  But in no way is that ever a legitimation of Zionism or a legitimation that Zionism
*  had a right to exist or to colonize Palestine the way that it did.
*  And so for Hamas, what it's doing here is it's articulating that, look, we as a movement
*  are pragmatic.
*  We can accept partition.
*  We can accept the establishment of the state of Israel.
*  But ideologically, asking us to accept and legitimize Zionism is actually counter to
*  Palestinian history.
*  And so the movement is speaking to its base as much as it's offering a pragmatic or a
*  political opportunity for external interlocutors.
*  The one other minor point that I want to mention here is that I've spoken to people in the
*  movement at that time, and there was also this sense that actually, even though they're
*  offering this pragmatic opening and the possibility of this being the beginning of some kind of
*  diplomatic maneuver, that it was also calling the bluff of Israel and of the international
*  community that, look, and this is something that I was told, we've offered more than Likud
*  has.
*  We've offered the 67 line, and no one will take us seriously.
*  And so there is also this recognition that actually, it doesn't serve Israel or Israeli
*  interests to engage with Hamas politically, because then they would have to consider the
*  67 line.
*  And there is a belief that many Palestinians share that Israel is not interested in the
*  67 line or in any idea of partition.
*  So there's a third piece of the formulation there that we haven't talked about yet, although
*  we gestured at it earlier in the conversation, which is the return of the refugees and the
*  displaced to their homes from which they were expelled.
*  This is something that the charter is really clear on.
*  There's another section of the charter where it says, quote, the right of the Palestinian
*  refugees and the displaced to return to their homes from which they were banished or were
*  banned from returning to, whether in the lands occupied in 1948 or in 1967, goes on to say,
*  is an inalienable right and cannot be dispensed with.
*  So tell me what that means in practice.
*  If Israel was to say, okay, 1967 lines and this, this sort of full right of return, what
*  would happen?
*  What are they agreeing to?
*  Well, I mean, the first thing to say is that this is not something that is limited to Hamas.
*  The right of return is fundamentally a right enshrined in international law.
*  So specifically, this is referring to UN resolution 194.
*  And this is something that all Palestinians hold as sacred.
*  So not only Hamas and the peace process as it unfolded over the past three decades was
*  focused on the surface level aspects of the conflict, but it didn't actually deal with
*  the root causes of the conflict, which is the injustice that happened to Palestinians in 1948.
*  What Palestinians refer to as an Aqba or the catastrophe when Palestinians were ethnically
*  cleansed from their homeland.
*  And the idea that there can be any lasting peace without reckoning with 1948 is one of
*  the key reasons why many Palestinians have been skeptical of the peace process and of
*  its ability to actually produce peace and justice.
*  And so what the charter is doing here is Hamas is articulating that core Palestinian demand
*  and saying that this is something that is non-negotiable.
*  Now, what that would mean in practice is the question at the core of this.
*  And I don't think anyone, I mean, certainly not Hamas or the Israeli, any Israeli government
*  has really grappled with what that means in practice.
*  But I think it's really a call to create a new reality in the land of historic Palestine,
*  where Palestinians have freedom, justice and equality.
*  And that fundamentally means the refugees coming back home.
*  But I want to be more specific than this.
*  I mean, we're talking about a very large population.
*  I think most estimates say about 700,000 Palestinians were forced out during the 1948 war.
*  And there are people who also left in subsequent periods.
*  That was 75 years ago, roughly.
*  So those families have had children, their children have had children, their children's
*  children have had children.
*  So we're dealing with a population of unknown size, I think, although there might be estimates
*  of it.
*  Many of the homes we're talking about are gone, right?
*  A city has arisen where there is once a town.
*  So what is being said here is the idea that if you can trace ancestry to having lived
*  in this area, that you go back and you're given the key to a house.
*  I mean, help me with this, because I actually don't understand what the demand is.
*  Well, I mean, I think there's several layers to the demand.
*  At its most basic, and this is by no means sufficient, but at its most basic, it's the
*  recognition that the Nakba happened.
*  It's a recognition that 700,000 plus people were expelled and ethnically cleansed from
*  the land of historic Palestine to create a Jewish state.
*  And this is not something that is limited to history, because as Palestinians have
*  consistently said, the Nakba is ongoing.
*  We see the dispossession happening every day in Palestine, in East Jerusalem, with Palestinians
*  being expelled from their homes, in the West Bank with them being expelled by settlers,
*  and most horrifically, since October 7th, in the massive displacement of Palestinians in
*  the Gaza Strip through the violence that Israel has unleashed in Gaza.
*  And Israeli officials openly talk about transfer.
*  So the idea that there's the recognition of ethnic cleansing as a pillar of the Israeli
*  state, that's the basic understanding of what the right of return means.
*  But from there, I think actually Hamas's charter discusses this more openly and says
*  anyone who was expelled and their descendants has a right to not only go back home, but
*  also to be compensated.
*  So the practicalities of that obviously haven't been determined because we're still in the
*  first level of even recognizing the fact that this is a right that Palestinians have.
*  And so if you think about international organizations like UNRWA, which is the organization
*  that's responsible for providing services to these refugees, even its mandate, it's
*  temporary, its mandate says this is about administering the needs of these Palestinian
*  refugees until a just resolution can be achieved.
*  And so for Palestinians, there's this sense of frozenness or stuckness that until that
*  initial ethnic cleansing is addressed and Palestinians are recognized to having been
*  dispossessed and offered compensation, possibly with the right to actually return, then we
*  haven't addressed the root cause of all the violence that's unfolding here.
*  The thing I'm trying to get at here is that one of the ways you can think about political
*  demands is do they exist?
*  And I think a point you often make is people pretend Hamas does not have political demands.
*  But another way to think about them is whether or not they are demands that have space for
*  actual political negotiation.
*  Millions of people were displaced at about the same period during the wars over partition
*  in India and Pakistan.
*  And I don't think anybody believes that the people displaced are going to be brought back
*  to their homes.
*  Whatever international law says or does not say, that's not going to happen.
*  And there are many, many states that have that quality that there was some kind of war
*  at their birth.
*  There was displacement and there is injustice in there and there is deep injustice.
*  But there is not at some point now or in the future going to be returned.
*  And to Israelis, if the only settlement here is a right of return where anybody who can
*  trace birth back to Palestinian land can come back, then to them that's the end of
*  the state of Israel and it's not going to be negotiated over.
*  And nor do they think this would be given to them.
*  Many Jews were expelled from Iran.
*  They're not getting their homes back.
*  Many Jews were expelled from many parts of the Arab world and they're not getting their
*  homes back.
*  So I think this is my question for you that to Israelis, this is not going to happen.
*  There are other things that can be negotiated over.
*  There are limited rights of return they could imagine.
*  But if the difference between Hamas and the PLO is that the PLO is willing to negotiate
*  over the kinds of things Israel felt it could negotiate over and Hamas is not, then this is a
*  recipe for war.
*  And their view that it's kind of us or them is sort of the view.
*  When you say or when Hamas says right of return, is there something that people can really
*  imagine happening here?
*  Or is it a thing that sits as a demand but in fact is simply a recipe for eternal conflict?
*  The simple answer to that is we don't know because no one has tried to engage on these
*  questions.
*  The Israelis have never felt compelled to really engage with the Palestinian political
*  demands.
*  The second point to note on this is that if there is any representative Palestinian
*  leadership, and by representative I mean a leadership that's speaking on behalf of the
*  Palestinian people and back to your earlier estimate of what that number is, the estimate
*  is around 14 million, that representative leadership will center the right of return.
*  There's little doubt in that.
*  Now the fact that Hamas is doing it now or that the PLO had conceded on it before, both
*  of these realities don't change the fact that this is a demand for Palestinians.
*  So if what you're saying that the Israelis cannot engage with that demand and that's a
*  recipe for perpetual conflict, then that's really saying that there's no engagement with
*  Palestinians generally, not just with Hamas.
*  And what that again takes us to is a recipe for what we're seeing happen today, which
*  is actually there's no engagement with the Palestinians, the only real solution is eradication.
*  And I'm not sure that anyone really wants to go there or entertain that.
*  I do think that engaging with this politically or diplomatically would be the responsible
*  thing to do.
*  The way Israeli politicians have engaged with the Palestinian demands is to ignore them
*  and to use military force to marginalize them and to force a situation where they become
*  negligible or pacified.
*  So there's no real answer that shows what engagement with that demand looks like.
*  And so really the right of return is going to the fundamental question, which says the
*  only way to sustain Israel as a Jewish state is to maintain an apartheid regime.
*  If we accept that cost, we accept that the right of return is an impossibility.
*  If we say, actually, we do not accept that, then the right of return becomes something
*  that we can begin talking about.
*  When I try to think about what negotiations between Israel and Hamas would look like,
*  this kind of sits at the center of it for me.
*  Israel's view is that Hamas will not accept the existence of a state that is majority
*  Jewish, right?
*  A state that is built on that line.
*  And it sounds a little bit to me like you're saying that however you describe that, that
*  is also Hamas's view.
*  And so there is a kind of ineluctable conflict here.
*  And I think sometimes about what this might look like a hundred years in the future.
*  If you imagine in an optimistic world that something happened and there was a negotiated
*  settlement and you had two states living alongside each other and those states had lived in
*  peace for some time, and you can imagine immigration opening up between them and so on.
*  But that's not where we are.
*  We are in a place where there has been mass butchery of Israeli civilians by Hamas, mass
*  bombing and killing of Palestinian civilians by Israel.
*  There have been decades-long history of suicide bombings of Israeli children and buses and
*  elders, decades-long bulldozing and sniping and shooting of Palestinian lives.
*  These are not peoples who feel safe next to each other.
*  So the idea that there's going to be free movement between them,
*  it doesn't feel realistic.
*  I mean, people want to live in security first.
*  And if you're going to accept that Israel is not going to do anything that it feels
*  compromises its security and Hamas has given it every reason to believe that its security
*  would be compromised by Hamas having more permeability into its borders.
*  I guess I don't understand how you get from there to, well, we can dismantle the Jewish
*  state and people will live alongside each other.
*  I don't understand then how tactics and ends match up here because you'd have to first
*  convince people that security is possible.
*  And I don't I see almost everything here is having been doing the opposite.
*  I think that's a really important question.
*  And it's one that I think about often.
*  And there's a few things to say here.
*  The first is that the notion of security has been limited to Israelis.
*  The second is that there is only an interest in Israeli security.
*  And this has been an underpinning demands of the peace process and all forms of diplomatic
*  negotiations.
*  Nowhere is the idea of Palestinian security mentioned, even though we are talking about
*  a nuclear power and an advanced military that's occupying people with no state and without
*  a military.
*  And when we're talking about security, we're only talking about Israeli security.
*  I appreciate that's not how you framed it.
*  I'm saying that this is how it's framed in the peace process and in negotiations.
*  So that's part of the problem that here we only talk about security for one set of people.
*  The other is that, again, the fear that the colonized people will do to the colonizer,
*  what the colonizer has done to them, is not limited to Israeli fears.
*  White Afrikaners feared what the Black South Africans would do to them if apartheid was
*  dismantled.
*  And white Americans feared what would happen to them if Jim Crow was dismantled.
*  Yet we had to dismantle those systems.
*  And the idea that security could only be provided by maintaining those systems has been
*  disproven.
*  And if there's anything that we can learn from October 7th, is that the idea that Israeli
*  Jews can be safe while apartheid persists is shattered now.
*  It was shattered in the most horrific and bloody way, but it was shattered.
*  So the idea that security can be produced by maintaining this oppressive rule over
*  Palestinians, we can't go back to that thinking now.
*  And so everything you outline is exactly the line of questioning we should be asking.
*  Now that we understand not only historically and in other contexts, but specifically in
*  Palestine and Israel, that there can be no security while apartheid persists, what are
*  the alternatives?
*  And I don't think we've even begun asking those questions.
*  But see, I want to go back to the peace process, because I do think that that in some ways
*  ends up at the core of this.
*  And I want to agree with a big part of what you just said.
*  It is constant that Israeli security is taken as a non-negotiable and Palestinian security
*  is contingent.
*  And I also agree with something else you said deeply, that there will not be true Israeli
*  security until there is true Palestinian freedom.
*  Defined in different ways, we can kind of talk about that.
*  And so that's why Hamas is a very difficult actor for me.
*  And the premise of this conversation with you is I want to take Hamas seriously, right?
*  I don't want to just dismiss them as a terrorist organization, or say they're pure evil and
*  you don't have to try to understand them.
*  And I'm not somebody who believes that Israel will be able to forever avoid negotiating
*  with Hamas, or if it was able to somehow destroy it, which I doubt, whatever comes after Hamas.
*  And so I want to take all those as premises that I share.
*  But this is why I do think what happens with Hamas' rise, and particularly around the second
*  Intifada, matters.
*  Because yes, there was difference, particularly on things like right of return, between where
*  the Israelis were and the Palestinians were.
*  But there was serious negotiation then.
*  There were efforts to settle issues that were not purely superficial.
*  I mean, land is a significant issue.
*  And when what came after that was a wave of suicide bombings, as somebody who's more involved
*  with the Israeli left, I watched the Israeli left die.
*  I watched the people who were arguing within Israel for some other pathway, which was not
*  going to be a maximalist right of return, but could have been something better than
*  what Gazans and people in the West Bank live under.
*  I watched them lose all their power.
*  And everything you say about the settlers, I agree with.
*  Everything you say about the settlers, I agree with.
*  And everything you say about that being a place where Israel has consistently made clear
*  that some of what it said publicly was not something you believe privately, I agree with.
*  But what gave those factions power, what continues to give them power when I talk to Israelis
*  today, is the legacy of suicide bombings.
*  At a point when Israelis felt they were trying to talk this through, their children started
*  getting killed in cafes and buses for years.
*  And it never recovered from that.
*  And so I think one of the things that I am trying to understand in this is I take Hamas
*  seriously.
*  I take it as an organization that tries to act rationally, that has demands, and that
*  has things that it wants in the world.
*  But if when it sees a process that can make movement going on and it destroys it, because
*  it wants something that it cannot have.
*  And I take it as fundamental that you are not going to get a right of return for 14
*  million people into the kind of 1967, pre-1967 Israeli borders.
*  Then I do wonder if we're speaking about this kind of realistically, if we are taking Israel
*  as seriously as you are saying we should take Hamas, if we are just saying Israel is right,
*  that is simply at war with Hamas.
*  And wars do not end often the way that apartheid ended in South Africa or the way that Jim
*  Crow ended in America.
*  They end in the thing that you fear.
*  They end in ethnic cleansing.
*  They end in expulsion.
*  They end in total defeat until some kind of stability is attained.
*  I mean, that is a lesson of history, not just of international law.
*  And I don't want to believe that here.
*  That is not what I want to see.
*  But I guess when I hear the idea that there is no version of this, it is not right of
*  return, and if there is, you get suicide bombings, I think I don't understand why if you care
*  about Palestinian security, that should be seen as a reasonable position.
*  You could have a lot more Palestinian security than this.
*  But if security for Palestinians can't come before right of return for Palestinians, then
*  I don't see how security is possible.
*  So you've asked a lot there, and I'll try to offer some thoughts, because I agree with
*  a lot of what you say.
*  I guess the first thing I'd say is the peace process never really reached the point of,
*  at least from the Israeli side, of actually offering the minimum demands for Palestinians.
*  Let's think about this for a second.
*  Palestinians, throughout the peace process, as an occupied people, have offered historic
*  concessions and have called for statehood in order to try to at least achieve a sense
*  of security.
*  Don't underestimate the incredible sacrifice that Palestinians did in 88 by recognizing
*  the state of Israel on 78% of their land.
*  That was the concession for them to try to get security, to try to be pragmatic.
*  That hasn't worked.
*  Palestinians have tried legal efforts, they've tried popular efforts, they've tried
*  intellectual efforts, they've tried diplomatic efforts to try to get a semblance of security.
*  And that's only been met with more force and with an Israeli government that's progressively
*  moving more right-wing.
*  So it's not Palestinians who are saying, we will not have security until the right of
*  return.
*  Palestinians are saying, the right of return is fundamental.
*  And we have tried every other effort to try to find some kind of compromise, even though
*  many Palestinians objected to that, and Hamas tried to spoil that, but there was every effort
*  to get there.
*  And that has only been met with rejection.
*  So the equation here is either full Palestinian submission, or you get seen as a terrorist
*  and you become a security threat, quote unquote.
*  There's nothing in between.
*  Now, the point about is this then a recipe for perpetual bloodshed?
*  And we hold up South Africa as an imaginary of an alternative where decolonization, in
*  many ways, the end of apartheid has worked and begun producing new outcomes.
*  Maybe that struggle isn't complete yet.
*  But of course, this is not a given.
*  There are other much uglier, much bloodier paths that this can go.
*  Don't you think that as an international community, specifically as an American superpower,
*  as the Biden administration, there's a responsibility to try to create political
*  alternatives that even if we don't have the answers for them now,
*  we can begin to maybe envision or we can begin to maybe articulate?
*  Don't you think that rather than taking a situation of maintaining a status quo or going
*  into full gloom, it is our responsibility to try to think about what actual engagement
*  with both Israeli Jews and with Palestinians and what the core demands of that would look like?
*  And so this is what's fundamental.
*  It's accepting the reality and the presence of these political demands.
*  I think two things there I really do agree with.
*  The international community, this is something you're pointing out with Biden, but it goes
*  before him too, did not create any kind of structure in which Palestinian demands in
*  the past 15 years' needs were being heard.
*  So there were things like the BDS campaigns, the divestment campaigns,
*  they got criminalized in many states.
*  So I think that if you do not want to see this conflict be violent and you're in America or
*  elsewhere, you have to really ask, were you listening to anything that was nonviolent?
*  And that doesn't to me in any way justify what Hamas did on 10-7, but it does cast some shame
*  and some questions backwards.
*  But I do want to go within that a little bit further because I do think that one reason
*  this got de-politicized is it did become despairing.
*  And the Israeli narrative and also the narrative of Middle East negotiators from America,
*  who I have spoken to, including on the show, is that in that period when there were real
*  deals being attempted and tried, a frustration for them, people who were trying to find another
*  answer here, who were trying to find a deal and were taking the political ask seriously,
*  was at a certain point they stopped getting answers that, yes, maybe the Israeli offer
*  was below the minimum of what Palestinians would accept.
*  But there was not a document put forward that this is the minimum of what Palestinians would
*  accept. They put forward offers and in the end something happened and nothing was agreed to.
*  And people went back and the second intifada began, as you say.
*  So when you say the maximum Israeli offer is well below the minimum of what Palestinians
*  would accept, what do you understand that minimum to be?
*  It depends on who you're talking to, of course. But in the context of that specific
*  peace process, the demands that were put forward by the PLO were largely in line with international
*  law, the creation of a Palestinian state on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem
*  as its capital. And in that context, obviously achieving full sovereignty for Palestinians,
*  the right of return was largely at that point accepted by internationals and the Israelis that
*  it would be limited to the Palestinian state. So in some ways, that was the minimum demand for
*  Palestinians for, again, this is for the Palestinian leadership, the PLO. So that's not necessarily
*  something that many Palestinians would agree with, but that was the official position of the PLO.
*  And even within the scale of that concession, I can't think of any offer from any Israeli
*  government that accepted that as the minimum. Instead, we ended up in consistent negotiations
*  about East Jerusalem and whether Palestinians have actual sovereignty over that. And I should
*  note here that Israel annexed East Jerusalem illegally. So already from the Israeli perspective,
*  that was off the table. And the idea that Palestinians would have full sovereignty,
*  so full control of the borders and full control of their own military power was also off the table,
*  because Israel positioned that as a security threat. So in some ways, it was an attempt to try to
*  force all of these political demands that are core to the Palestinians into this contorted form that
*  would fit the Israeli architecture. And that Israeli architecture was built on two things. One,
*  the idea that the greater land of Israel should be settled, and that belongs to the Jewish
*  community. And anything that challenges that is a security threat. And B, Israel should be a Jewish
*  majority state, which means that Palestinians have to be demographically engineered and pushed out to
*  minimize the demographic implications of that. So again, that's not to say that the peace process
*  couldn't have worked. That's a counterfactual. No one can say that with any certainty. There
*  could have been a situation where the two-state solution worked, and there are many reasons why
*  it didn't. But fundamentally, the peace process didn't deal with any of the core issues that
*  animated and continue to animate the Palestinian struggle for self-determination.
*  One thing that I often hear from people who have been involved in this is whether or not anybody
*  on the Palestinian side has the political authority to make a deal. There is very deep division
*  between Hamas and Fatah, of course, division that Israel has done a lot to stoke. And as you say,
*  I mean, Israel has done quite a lot to make a reasonable two-state solution impossible.
*  And I think that is its great sin, and also something that could be very much exploited.
*  By a united Palestinian leadership, you were saying earlier, what is the responsibility of
*  America and Joe Biden here? And something that I was thinking about was, for a long time, many of
*  us have said that Israel should not get more American money, so long as it is building
*  settlements, and so long as it does not have a path to deconstructing the ones it has in a deal.
*  So I actually think there's quite a lot of vulnerability in the Israeli desire to hold the
*  high ground in this process. But one thing that has been a tremendous advantage for them has been
*  that there has not been a leadership able to say, this is what we want and would accept,
*  that looks reasonable to people. It seems to me that Abbas does not have the power,
*  the authority, the legitimacy to release a deal like that and try to hold to it.
*  That's really the core question for Palestinians. There needs to be a concerted effort to produce
*  a legitimate, representative and democratic leadership that is able to speak on behalf of
*  the Palestinians generally. Not just the Palestinians under occupation in the West Bank,
*  the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, but the Palestinian people, including Palestinian citizens
*  of Israel, including Palestinian refugees. There needs to be a concerted effort by Palestinians
*  to create national frameworks that are able to represent the voice of the Palestinian people.
*  And that is the biggest weakness that Palestinians have at this moment in time. So I want to center
*  that for Palestinians while also saying as a secondary point that that is also not a coincidence.
*  This is by design. The Palestinian leadership has been assassinated, imprisoned, and defeated
*  diplomatically and militarily. The fact that now Hamas is the only military power that Palestinians
*  think of as an organization that is capable of defending the Palestinians against Israeli
*  violence or even talking about the Palestinian rights is not coincidence. This is coming upon
*  years and years of undermining the PLO, of enabling, supporting a Palestinian authority that is corrupt,
*  that is illegitimate. Again, I have to stress that this is a responsibility for Palestinians
*  to push for that leadership and to recreate institutions of liberation that are representative
*  and democratic. And by the way they did exist in the PLO in its heyday, it was an organization
*  that was ideologically and intellectually grounded and that was representative of the Palestinians.
*  But it's been decades since we've been there and that's the responsibility of Palestinians.
*  But it's really important to understand the context in which there is now no singular authority
*  that is legitimate or representative that is speaking on behalf of Palestinians. And I think
*  that's the biggest weakness for Palestinians today. If you did have the capacity, if there was a
*  capacity internally to reform, what does that look like? I mean, I've heard a lot of people make this
*  point that what the Palestinian governing structure was supposed to be has collapsed.
*  It has collapsed because Hamas and Fatah cannot work together. Now we're in this moment of
*  tremendous upheaval. And it seems to me that the outcome of this is going to be paradoxical,
*  that on the one hand Israel is going to no longer in any way permit Hamas to rule over Gaza, right?
*  So Hamas' base of actual operation and governing and the place where it was able to
*  build strength and plan this attack is over. And on the other hand, from some of the reporting
*  I read and some of the polling I look at, it looks like Hamas is seen yet more here as the
*  kind of leader of the Palestinian liberation effort. Right now Palestinians see Hamas negotiating
*  for the return of Palestinian prisoners and Palestinians do not feel, which is I think the
*  narrative in the West, that Hamas is treating their lives as meaningless. It feels like it's
*  running a struggle on their behalf and is doing so, I don't know if effectively is the right word,
*  but at least it is conducting it. So you can tell me if that is wrong about how the politics are
*  shifting. But if that's true, how do you think about that paradox between Hamas emerging
*  more central to the Palestinian struggle than it was maybe a year ago, but also losing its actual
*  base of organizing and power compared to where it was three months ago?
*  Well, I mean, Hamas has always been ambivalent actually about its role as a governing authority.
*  It viewed that very much as a burden, as something that shackled the movement. It shackled its ability
*  to act in ways that were focused on military resistance and on strategy, because now obviously
*  it had to account for its role as a governing authority. Now it benefited massively from having
*  control in the Gaza Strip, of course, because as you say, this is where it developed its base and
*  it established its military infrastructure and all of that, and was then able to do what it did on
*  October 7th, which from the movement's perspective was a victory and continues to be a victory for
*  despite the destruction in the Gaza Strip today. So the idea that Israel can defeat Hamas, or that
*  it can militarily decimate Hamas is unachievable. Even if we were to say that that goal is restricted
*  to the military wing of Hamas and Israel might be able to destroy Hamas' military wing, the movement
*  can recreate that. The movement is also a political body. It's also a social infrastructure. So even
*  if Hamas were to be removed, that ideology of commitment to armed resistance for liberation
*  would manifest in a different movement. So the idea that Hamas can be destroyed or that that
*  threat can be removed is nonsensical. And so the only other alternative is that some kind of
*  governing authority is cooked up. That will be tried. And it might be the case that Hamas
*  actually isn't able to operate for quite a long period of time. But what we've learned from the
*  past 16 years, and we've known that a long time, but it's now apparent, is that Hamas is playing
*  the long game. So the Palestinian people and the Palestinian Liberation Project is, like any
*  liberation project, diverse. And many people do not support Hamas' ideology and do not support
*  Hamas' tactics. Others do. Historically, when Hamas engages in armed resistance against Israel,
*  that is generally supported by many Palestinians because it is seen as the only party that is
*  providing self-defense against colonial violence. And that is celebrated even though the cost that
*  Palestinians incur in response is horrifying. And so that should give you an indication of where the
*  Palestinians are at and how desperate they are and how committed they are to the idea of liberation
*  and to the idea that this is one of the most fundamental, if not the only way, that Israel has
*  offered concessions or responded in the past. Now, we've never seen anything since the Nakba
*  near the level of destruction or mass killing that we're seeing in the Gaza Strip today. How that
*  calculus changes is still too early to tell. And I would venture that there is some resentment
*  against Hamas for various reasons, including its governance in Gaza before this specific operation,
*  but also for the level of destruction that now Palestinians in Gaza have to face. But alongside
*  that, I would guess that there's strong support for what Hamas has done and for the fact that Hamas
*  seems to be militarily actually emerging quite victorious from this. I think victorious is an
*  interesting word there. So I'd be curious what you mean by it. But I also want to ask a question
*  about this sort of what people call the day after problem. Let's say that we're fast forwarding
*  a year, two years, three years, Netanyahu's gone, Israel's operation in Gaza is over,
*  though it is still keeping some control of Gaza because it believes that to be a security need.
*  But that Benny Gantz is now prime minister and has had a sort of epiphany that you are right,
*  Tark Baconia is right. And that going back to the kind of status quo of five years ago is not going
*  to work. There is no stability in the equilibrium that they were in. And so if he wants to negotiate
*  with someone, is there someone to negotiate with even as a beginning point? Or is the Palestinian
*  Authority under Abbas? Has it lost too much credibility? Obviously, Israel's not in the
*  near term going to be sitting down with Hamas's leadership as a representative of the Palestinian
*  people. I mean, I know you were saying a minute ago, this is a challenge for the Palestinians.
*  But if it comes up quickly, right, if Joe Biden does decide that the international community can
*  no longer let this go forward the way it has been, and there do need to be new negotiations,
*  and America needs to approach those with a different kind of muscle and resolve,
*  who is at that table in your view? So I want to say one thing about the word victorious.
*  It's important that you pointed that out. This is not a value judgment from me personally. This is
*  how Hamas is seeing this. And it's important to make that distinction. And I will explain why Hamas
*  is viewing it as a victory. The movement in its own thinking managed to disrupt the fundamental
*  assertion and assessment that Israelis have, which is that they can maintain security for
*  their citizens while apartheid is ongoing, and that they can maintain the occupation cost free,
*  that the Palestinians have been vanquished. Hamas has managed to successfully overturn that.
*  And it did that by showing not only that the Israeli intelligence and its security forces
*  are not invincible, but also that they are much weaker than at least the image that they present.
*  And that was shown on October 7th by the scale of what Hamas did, which I think extended beyond
*  what Hamas' imagination was. But even since then, despite the massive destruction and the
*  horrifying loss of life in Gaza, Hamas' military actually hasn't been fundamentally challenged
*  yet. If we look at the numbers, Hamas' military is about 50,000 fighters. About 4,000 have been
*  killed so far. That's not a significant number. And so militarily, Hamas is still in a pretty
*  powerful position. And we can see that in the way they're approaching both the hostage negotiations
*  and the release of hostages. But that's taking us on a bit of a divergence. You wanted to talk about
*  what the day after looks like and who's representing Palestinians. So in this fantastical world where
*  there's now growing recognition that political demands of the Palestinian people need to be
*  contended with seriously, the first thing that needs to happen is to accept that the Palestinians
*  need to be able to democratically elect their own leaders without foreign interference.
*  And that should take the form of reforming the body of the PLO. For that to happen effectively,
*  Hamas and other factions that the international community might not like very much need to be a
*  part of the PLO. So the first step, I mean, Palestinians obviously their own leaders need
*  to also check their authoritarianism and allow for democratic elections to happen. But a fundamental
*  step here for the international community is to stop interfering in Palestinian politics and allow
*  that democratic action to take its own course. I feel like there's hours more of conversation
*  we could have, but I'm really grateful for the extra time you're able to give us today. And I
*  know you have to run. So this is always our final question on the show. What are three books that
*  have influenced you that you would recommend to the audience?
*  Thank you, Ezra. I wish we had more time as well. The three books that I recommend in this specific
*  context and moment in time, the first is Rashid Khalidi's Hundred Years War on Palestine, which
*  is deservedly on the New York Times bestseller list now. And it shows the context for this moment
*  that we find ourselves in. This didn't begin on October 7th. It's a century of oppression and
*  colonization of the Palestinian people. And that book is fundamental. The second is a book
*  that is very dear to me called Return to Haifa by Ghassan Qanafani, who is a Palestinian political
*  and literary giant. And the book Return to Haifa talks about a Palestinian family that
*  goes back to the home from which they were expelled in 1948. They were expelled in 1948,
*  but they go back to their home in 1967 when the West Bank falls under Israeli military occupation
*  and they're able to drive back to their home and engage with the settlers who live in that home.
*  And then the third book is a book that is called Light in Gaza, Writings Born in Fire,
*  that was edited by Jihad Abu Salim, Jennifer Bing, and Mike Merriman-Loss. And it is a collection of
*  writings and poetry from writers in the Gaza Strip, including Mus'hab Abu At-Tukha, and
*  Asma Abu Mizyad, which is just incredible and shows the voices of Palestinians in Gaza.
*  And these are the people we should be thinking about today.
*  And Tark Baconi, your book is called Hamas Contained, which I think is an essential place
*  to begin for people who want to understand Hamas on its own terms. Thank you very much.
*  Thank you so much, Asra.
