# Maggie Haberman on Whether Aging Has Changed Trump
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jFzxgS5Xaw)
*  You've interviewed him a lot over the years. How would you say age has changed him?
*  I mean, he's definitely older
*  I can tell by talking to him that he's older and I can tell by watching him that he's older if you look at
*  His 2011 conservative political action committee speech. It's the same getting bored with the text, right?
*  He's got a printed speech in front of him
*  It's not teleprompters and he starts telling stories and you can see the crowds fading and then he says something and they like it
*  So he repeats it and that's all familiar, but he's much sharper. It's just it's faster. It's clearer
*  He's doing this thing when he talks where it's like he's dropping the proper nouns out of his sentences
*  It can be a lot harder to track
*  He'll just say he and unless you're really following what he's saying from the start to the end
*  It's not always easy to tell exactly what he's talking about
*  But I attribute that to age I attribute that just to being older
*  But I don't think there is some massive difference in him. I really don't I think that for the most part
*  He is the same person that he has always been with far less interest or ability in
*  Presenting a filter in any situation
