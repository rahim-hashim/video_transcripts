Video Description: Democrats spent the third night of their convention pitching themselves as the party of freedom. In this conversation, my producer Annie Galvin joined me on the show to take a deep look at that messaging. Why do Democrats see an opportunity in this election to seize an idea that Republicans have monopolized for decades? What’s the meaning of “freedom” that Democrats seem to be embracing? And how does this message square with other Democratic Party values, like belief in the ability of government to do good?

# Can the Democratic Party Reclaim Freedom?
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWfiRuvBhPg)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  It is Thursday, August 22.
*  We just saw the third day of the Democratic National Convention, an evening dedicated
*  to the Democrats' evolving theory and message on freedom.
*  I'm joined today by my producer, Annie Galvin.
*  Annie, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  So as you mentioned, the stated theme of last night at the DNC was a fight for our freedoms.
*  And from the jump, we heard a lot about freedom.
*  Tonight, let's talk about freedom.
*  This election is about our rights, our freedoms, our democracy, and our future.
*  Kamala Harris is fighting for our freedom.
*  Kamala Harris is fighting for our families.
*  Kamala Harris is fighting for our future together.
*  Kamala Harris cares deeply about other people.
*  She will fight to protect our freedoms because those are the values that her mother passed
*  down to her.
*  Let us choose.
*  Let us choose truth.
*  Let us choose honor.
*  And let us choose joy.
*  Because that's the best of America.
*  But more than anything else, let us choose freedom.
*  Why?
*  Because that's the best of America.
*  We're all Americans and together, let's all choose Kamala Harris.
*  How were Democrats talking about freedom last night?
*  What did you notice?
*  They've been talking about freedom across the campaign since Kamala Harris became the
*  nominee or presumptive nominee.
*  And they've been talking about it in a way that has an old echo in democratic politics.
*  So FDR very famously gave this speech about the four freedoms.
*  This was his 1941 State of the Union.
*  We look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.
*  And the four freedoms, which everyone in the world, he said, should enjoy, were freedom
*  of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear.
*  And obviously, freedom from want and freedom from fear are more significant promises.
*  But you often hear among political philosophers this distinction between the negative and
*  the positive freedoms.
*  Right.
*  There are the freedoms from I'm supposed to be free from the government busting into
*  my room and searching it without a warrant.
*  But that does not necessarily mean I am free to have a life that flourishes because I have
*  good, reliable health care or child care or elder care or guaranteed income.
*  And you see certain Democrats moving between these two ideas over the course of the week.
*  Kamala Harris in being a lawyer who thinks a lot in terms of rights, I think, found this
*  very natural as language to adopt.
*  And now you see it filtering through the party.
*  So to illustrate this, I'd like to play a clip from Tim Walz.
*  And just to set this up, right before this, he went on this pretty moving riff about how
*  he and his wife, Gwen, used fertility treatments after struggling with infertility for quite
*  a while.
*  And in that riff, he made the point that having access to fertility treatments is a kind of
*  freedom in and of itself.
*  So let's hear that clip.
*  I'm letting you in on how we started a family because this is a big part about what this
*  election is about.
*  Freedom.
*  When Republicans use the word freedom, they mean that the government should be free to
*  invade your doctor's office.
*  Corporations free to pollute your air and water.
*  And banks free to take advantage of customers.
*  But when we Democrats talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make a better life
*  for yourself and the people that you love.
*  Freedom to make your own health care decisions.
*  And yeah, your kids' freedom to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in
*  the hall.
*  So how is Waltz putting his spin on this?
*  How is he approaching this project of reclaiming freedom for Democrats?
*  I would call what he's doing negative freedom.
*  Freedom from the government getting involved in your life.
*  Freedom from the fear of your child being shot dead in the halls.
*  Freedom from intrusion from other things.
*  And that speaks to a broader set of arguments that Waltz was on that stage to make.
*  One of his big applause lines was that in the kinds of communities he comes from, they
*  have the golden rule.
*  And the golden rule is mind your own damn business.
*  That is not how Democrats traditionally speak.
*  The Democratic idea is not mind your own damn business.
*  It is help and it's help from the government.
*  But there is a tension in the argument being made here.
*  When you begin talking about those freedoms from, right, freedom from having the government
*  in your libraries, in your doctor's office, et cetera, then you get the Republican counterargument.
*  Well, what about my freedom to have the kind of car I want or to use plastic straws in
*  California or my freedom to not be covered by a vaccine mandate, if you're thinking a
*  couple of years ago?
*  So this is where sort of Democrats began to lose that argument because there's quite a
*  lot they want the government to regulate.
*  There are a million places where Democrats do not mind their own damn business.
*  So that's the tension here.
*  It's being portrayed as a principle, but it's not a principle in either party, by the way,
*  right?
*  Republicans who have often portrayed themselves as more small government and libertarian,
*  they're not at all.
*  And what you're seeing here is not a sort of new agenda being adopted.
*  It is a bid for rhetorical high ground based on which issues are salient in this election.
*  And the reason Democrats are being able or at least see an opportunity to flip this is
*  in repealing Roe v. Wade and the sort of reproductive freedom, which is built on a right to privacy,
*  Republicans have created space for the government to become much more intrusive in people's
*  personal and sexual and familial lives.
*  And having done that, having made that kind of government intervention and intrusion salient,
*  now all of a sudden, Democrats can turn around and say, what the hell is wrong with you all?
*  Get out of here.
*  Get out of the doctor's office.
*  Get out of the bedroom.
*  Leave us alone, which is usually not an argument Democrats have a lot of standing to make because
*  honestly, usually it's a Democrat saying, we're going to force you to have health care
*  insurance.
*  We're going to make sure you're following good environmental practices and standards.
*  We're going to try to get you to get rid of your old furnace and buy a electric fuel
*  pump.
*  There are all these different things where Democrats want the government involved, but
*  Republicans have made salient the single biggest place where they want to expand the government's
*  control over people's intimate lives.
*  We also heard a version of this from Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania and
*  almost vice presidential pick.
*  So let's hear that.
*  You know what?
*  You know what, Democrats?
*  We are the party of real freedom.
*  That's right.
*  The kind of real freedom that comes when that child has a great public school with an awesome
*  teacher because we believe in her future.
*  Real freedom, real freedom that comes when we invest in the police and in the community
*  so that child can walk to and from school and get home safely to her mama.
*  Real freedom, real freedom that comes when she can join a union, marry who she loves,
*  start a family on her own terms, breathe clean air, drink pure water, worship how she wants
*  and live a life of purpose where she is respected for who she is.
*  So Shapiro there is obviously trying to flip freedom from being a Republican value to a
*  Democratic one.
*  How effective do you think Shapiro was in making that rhetorical move there?
*  I don't know that the question for Shapiro is whether he's being effective, right?
*  You're not going to do that in one speech.
*  You're not going to do that at a convention.
*  If the Democratic Party wants to reclaim freedom, which is something that factions within it
*  and pollsters within it and strategists within it and philosophers within it have wanted
*  it to do for a long time, that's going to require time.
*  That is going to be a multi-administration, maybe even multi-generational effort.
*  That said, I've always thought the argument for positive freedoms or what Shapiro called
*  real freedom is pretty powerful.
*  I don't know what vision of freedom you are really talking about.
*  When you say you are free, this is within the sort of hardcore capitalist way of looking
*  at the world, you are free to freely contract, which is to say that you are free to not have
*  a job.
*  You are free to walk away from something without any power in the marketplace and be poor and
*  go hungry and be homeless.
*  That is not freedom, right?
*  That's not real choice.
*  A thicker idea and understanding of freedom has always included within it what you need
*  to flourish, right?
*  To be free, to make the choices you want to make in your life requires the furnishing
*  of a foundation and protections that people need.
*  Social Security is a remarkable enabler of freedom among older Americans.
*  Among other things, it is the freedom to retire.
*  Absent it, you might be free to retire, but you are not actually capable of making that
*  choice.
*  So, there's power in this.
*  Since maybe 9-11, the right really claimed a monopoly on freedom.
*  I mean, you had kind of silly things like freedom fries, but you also had the rise of
*  the Freedom Caucus.
*  You now have Republicans branding basically every Democrat as a socialist and not a friendly
*  Swedish socialist, but a Stalinist basically.
*  And then on the left, I think maybe around Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, you
*  would hear words like equality, justice, maybe progress, but freedom seemed sort of off limits
*  or uncool.
*  So, why is this the moment for Democrats to kind of step in and try to seize freedom as
*  their value?
*  I think one reason is that Trump and Vance don't speak in terms of freedom.
*  Donald Trump is not highly engaged with discussions of freedom one way or the other.
*  It's just not what his politics are about.
*  And I think you have to understand a lot of this election as being shaped by Vance's spin
*  on Trumpism.
*  Vance's spin on Trumpism and the sort of post-liberal spin on Trumpism is very dismissive of freedom.
*  To take the philosophical roots of what is going on in the right seriously for a minute,
*  when you read these critiques of liberalism, when you read Patrick Deneen, when you read
*  Adrian Vermouil, the thing that they are critiquing in liberalism is its emphasis on individual
*  freedom.
*  And the argument is that individual freedom has led to social atomization, has led to
*  people having too few children for societies to grow and flourish and replace themselves.
*  It has led to loneliness.
*  It has led to companies that can ship their jobs overseas and destroy communities.
*  But it has led above all to this world where individual choice and individual freedom have
*  become the dominant values.
*  And so people can go off and live these lives of sexual libertinism and atheism and they
*  don't have children.
*  And then all this freedom has become hollow and rotten at its core.
*  To make these arguments about these miserable cat ladies is at least to begin to make the
*  argument there should be social and cultural sanction over people exercising an individual
*  choice not to have children.
*  So part of what is happening is Democrats are responding to a reform, a shift, a pivot
*  inside the Republican Party and add in then dobs and book bans and a bunch of Republicans
*  saying publicly that they want to use the power of the state to bring other institutions
*  ranging from businesses to universities in life to heal.
*  So they stop being so woke and they stop being so liberal and they stop being a deep state
*  and so on.
*  And all of a sudden the Republican Party that is coming to a very, very different understanding
*  of freedom, right, it's not interested in freedom.
*  It's interested in using the power of the state and the power of the culture to reshape
*  decision making quite powerfully.
*  And all of a sudden the Democratic Party can turn around and say, the hell are you weirdos
*  doing get out of here?
*  That was the argument that launched Tim Walz and part of elevating Walz to the ticket was
*  also Harris elevating the critique and argument he was making to the ticket.
*  I think that's a really good point that Trump fans to Santas have created an opening in
*  a way that McCain Romney maybe didn't.
*  I'm curious then about the appeal that Democrats think this might have, because I think over
*  the last three nights we've seen a lot of appeals from actual Republicans, former Trump
*  staffers, Oprah who said she's a registered independent and spoke very directly to independent
*  voters trying to get them to come over to the Kamala side.
*  And you see that at most conventions, right?
*  You saw it at the RNC a bit.
*  But do you see this turn to freedom as an attempt to woo these people?
*  I'm just curious what the point is of this electorally.
*  One of the inversions of politics right now is traditionally the Republican Party is the
*  party that wants to conserve, the party that doesn't want to do all that much.
*  The conservative party, you can argue that's not been true for a long time and Republicans
*  have been more radical going some time back, arguably since Reagan.
*  But there has always been, or for a long time has been, a theory that Democrats are
*  the party that wants to change everything, Barack Obama, hope and change, and Republicans
*  are the party that wants to preserve America as it is and as it was.
*  And as Republicans become more radical and more oriented towards upheaval, JD Vance,
*  again, if you go listen to things he said, is very straightforward about this.
*  And so too is Donald Trump, right?
*  Donald Trump has always portrayed himself as a wrecking ball, not as a conservationist.
*  That has created this space among Democrats who have also become a coalition with a lot
*  of more educated members, with a lot of higher income members, a lot of people who maybe
*  want things to be a little bit different, but don't want them completely different than
*  they are, to be a party that is actually arguing we should conserve things.
*  One thing that has been striking to me about this convention is if you watch it and ask
*  yourself day after day, what promises are being made up there?
*  What is the Democratic Party saying it will do for you?
*  Not that much is being said all that consistently.
*  This is not a convention built around a couple of big promises from an agenda.
*  It's not a convention built around bringing universal health care to the nation, not a
*  convention built around bringing universal child care to the nation.
*  To the extent it is about any one policy promise, the policy promise is restoring something
*  people had a couple of years ago, which is the protections of Roe v. Wade.
*  In a way, that's actually conservative.
*  It's saying America was at a reasonable equilibrium for a very long time.
*  Republicans built around a quite radical Supreme Court have upended that equilibrium.
*  They changed the country in a heedless and thoughtless and dangerous way.
*  Democrats are going to put things back the way they were.
*  That sort of allows them to be the party of change because that is different than where
*  things are right now, but also conservation, conservatism at the same time.
*  The crux of the four freedom speech that you mentioned was really FDR during World War
*  II trying to define the free world in contrast to authoritarianism.
*  When we're talking about freedom too, the most basic one of those in a democracy is
*  the freedom to vote.
*  I think that word democracy was a huge part of the Biden era of this campaign.
*  Is this messaging around freedom a way to signal the democracy message?
*  Earlier in the night last night, they did a video and had speakers also, but they did
*  a video about January 6th.
*  It was incredibly powerfully done, I thought.
*  They sort of matched what Trump was saying at any given moment to what was happening.
*  You saw the video of the officers trying to barricade the doors and screaming as they
*  tried to push back the crowd.
*  You heard them on their intercom saying, the line is broken, the line is broken, fall back.
*  You saw their vantage point from high up at the Capitol saying, we're in danger.
*  Look at the size of that crowd.
*  It was chilling.
*  It also came early in the night.
*  I wondered if the rest of that was going to be more January 60.
*  They had a police officer after that, but it wasn't.
*  I think if it was Biden's campaign, this convention would have been about January 6th.
*  That was Mike Donilon's theory of the election.
*  But also, Biden putting aside the ways his communication capabilities had changed, Biden
*  was a good messenger on democracy.
*  Biden really does believe America and democracy to be a sacred trust.
*  You could feel that he felt it.
*  He's always said that he decided to run after Charlottesville.
*  He read How Democracies Die by Levitsky and Zibla.
*  That influenced him in running.
*  And then January 6th was, as his people remind you, an effort to steal the election, not
*  just from the American people, but from Joe Biden personally.
*  Biden is not that good of a messenger on abortion.
*  Among other things, his own history on it is checkered.
*  He opposed the Roe decision when it came down.
*  Now, he's evolved quite a lot on that issue since then.
*  But he's just not that good at talking about abortion and DABs.
*  You saw this in the debate.
*  And Harris is...
*  And so I think that the emphasis has really shifted from this being about democracy with
*  January 6th as the evidence to this being about freedom with DABs being the evidence.
*  And I think that's a better place for Democrats just because I think DABs is...
*  January 6th happened, but it is not currently happening.
*  It could, of course, happen again, something like it or something worse.
*  But most people who are open to voting for Donald Trump do not believe Donald Trump is
*  just going to do endless January 6th.
*  Maybe they should believe that, but I don't think that's how they look at him.
*  But they do believe, because it's true, that he was the one who appointed Supreme Court
*  justices who overturned Roe and that the people in his party want to ban abortion.
*  January 6th failed.
*  People died.
*  It was horrifying, but it failed.
*  Joe Biden became president.
*  DABs succeeded.
*  There are many states now where you cannot get an abortion.
*  And unless Democrats get rid of the filibuster, even in a situation where they win the Senate,
*  they're not going to be able to restore Roe, though maybe they will get rid of the filibuster
*  for that.
*  I don't think it is a completely unimaginable turn of events.
*  It is true that in power, Democrats can do a lot to protect abortion rights or to open
*  access to it, particularly chemical abortion.
*  And it is also true that Republicans, if they get a chance, might take this in a very sharply
*  different direction.
*  If you had a Republican trifecta, Donald Trump now talks about wanting this all to be on
*  the states.
*  But if Republicans sent him a 15-week abortion ban, House and Senate Republicans, would he
*  veto it?
*  I'm skeptical of that.
*  I think one should be skeptical of that.
*  And so this has been a shift in where the party is.
*  And I think it's a good shift because it's very hard to get people to vote on the abstraction
*  of democracy.
*  That's not how I wish things were, but I think it is how things actually are.
*  But it is not impossible, and we've seen it, to get them to vote based on the extremely
*  tangible stakes for whether or not people have access to abortions if and when they
*  need them.
*  So I want to talk a little bit about the difference between the RNC and the DNC,
*  specifically their focus.
*  And you said to our team that the two conventions have had a feeling of the Marvel universe
*  versus Thanos.
*  And I'll admit, I do not know what that means, but I'm confident there's some merit there.
*  So what did you mean by that analogy, that way of describing the difference here?
*  You've never seen Avengers Endgame?
*  Come on.
*  I've seen one or two, but I don't even know which ones.
*  I'm so sorry.
*  You would remember.
*  So the argument I'm making there.
*  You look at the Democratic convention.
*  Every major Democrat from the last 40 years of American life, it's Joe Biden.
*  It's Barack Obama.
*  It's Bill Clinton.
*  It's Hillary Clinton.
*  It's Michelle Obama.
*  I saw a picture of John Edwards standing in the hallway.
*  If Jimmy Carter were well enough, he would be here.
*  Every Democrat who has had any significant national profile and is still upright and
*  walking more or less in my lifetime is here lending their talents, their particular
*  political profile to the fight against Donald Trump.
*  Go look at the Republican convention.
*  Who in national Republican politics, who is significant in 2020,
*  or before that is still there.
*  There's no Mike Pence.
*  There's no George W.
*  Bush.
*  There are no Cheney's, right?
*  Liz Cheney's been ejected from the party.
*  There's no Mitt Romney.
*  No Paul Ryan.
*  They're all gone.
*  So it does have this feeling.
*  If you're a comic books nerd, and I am like the Democrats have this feeling of the
*  Avengers, right?
*  It's like every significant figure in the party, like coming together, like we're
*  assembling a team and the Republican party is sort of the big
*  powerful bad guy with a billion henchmen.
*  They're all smaller than Donald Trump.
*  They're all the guys he orders around.
*  Whereas the Democratic party, the way it is presenting itself is this sort of union
*  of significant figures.
*  The young heroes in Harris right now and in Walls, but they're going around and
*  pulling out of retirement anybody who's a heavy hitter who can possibly be
*  conscripted into the cause.
*  And I guess just another way of saying that without the perhaps too cute by half
*  comic book analogy is just that the Democratic party is a political party and
*  the Republican party is a personality cult.
*  And what you see when you look at the Democratic convention is a political party, a
*  lot of different people representing a lot of different factions and eras.
*  Somebody on social media made, I thought a quite funny point that the Democratic
*  convention is like the era's tour for liberals, which is true.
*  I mean, yeah.
*  And the Republican party has functionally erased its history before.
*  I mean, you could call 2016, but a lot of people who are significant in the Republican
*  party between 2016 and 2020 are now also persona non grata.
*  Right.
*  Again, thinking about people like Paul Ryan there and Mike Pence.
*  So it almost doesn't have history pre January six.
*  That's just a very different structure.
*  So just to dig into the portrait of a party that I think the DNC has pretty successfully
*  given us so far, I think you see this coalition across ages, which is kind of interesting
*  because aging was kind of the problem a month ago, two months ago.
*  But you're now seeing these elder statesmen all given speaking slots, the Clintons, the
*  Obamas, Biden himself.
*  But I think you're also seeing this kind of murderers row of new talent and you're
*  free to name check some of these.
*  But just to start with the elder statesman, what did you make of Bill Clinton's speech
*  last night?
*  What was his role there and how did he execute on that?
*  Bill Clinton has gotten a lot older.
*  This was not the kind of speech Bill Clinton was able to give in, say, 2012 when he was
*  the star of the convention.
*  There was a, for me at least, a kind of sadness watching him up there.
*  You could see his hands shaking his voice, right?
*  His voice has always been such a remarkable instrument.
*  His voice was thick and he would lose control over it.
*  It would crack.
*  It'd be hard to hear the intonation be wrong.
*  But Clinton had a real capability, a real self-awareness about that in which to strike
*  the tone of the truly elder statesman.
*  But one thing Clinton did very effectively was used his age against Donald Trump.
*  And he did something else too, which is Clinton has always had this capability to slip into
*  the highly idealistic register of what American politics can be.
*  And I'm just speaking for myself here.
*  I found it powerful when he made this argument that it's not Trump's lying that should be
*  our focus.
*  It's his solipsism, his narcissism, his inability to talk about anything other than himself.
*  What does our opponent do with his voice?
*  He mostly talks about himself, right?
*  Right?
*  So the next time you hear him, don't count the lies.
*  Count the eyes.
*  Count the eyes.
*  His vendettas, his vengeance, his complaints, his conspiracies.
*  He's like one of those tenors opening up before he walks out on stage like I did, trying to get his
*  lungs open by singing me, me, me, me, me, me.
*  Clinton's just good at delivering that kind of thing.
*  I think both with Obama and with Clinton, what you should understand them as doing is saying,
*  I am one of the best to ever do this.
*  They are two of the best campaigners to ever campaign.
*  And what they are saying is like, if I were doing it, this is how I would do it.
*  But Clinton wasn't there as the representative anymore of a politics that he was saying,
*  Harrison Wall should pick up from him.
*  He was there as a party elder, just being part of the Avengers.
*  I've been interested in this convention at who I feel is picking up different,
*  I don't know, torches in the party.
*  I don't know why, but you're right, Annie.
*  This convention has felt like a real moment of generational change in the party.
*  It's easy to forget just for how long we've had Obama's, Clinton's and Biden's on the ticket.
*  And I thought one of the best speeches of last night,
*  and the one who sounded most like Bill Clinton to me was Buttigieg.
*  Pete Buttigieg, who is an amazing communicator, I think arguably the best communicator right now
*  in the Democratic Party.
*  If you don't count Michelle Obama, who doesn't like doing politics?
*  But he gave a very Clinton-like speech in his ability to talk about, to marry
*  the high level, the aspirational level of American politics
*  with the kitchen table level of American politics.
*  Buttigieg is often compared to Obama.
*  He kind of seems like he comes from that era.
*  But I think the politics he often feels like he is representing to me is
*  a little bit more Clintonian.
*  Pete Buttigieg I'm thinking of dinner time at our house in Michigan.
*  When the dog is barking and the air fryer is beeping and the mac and cheese is boiling over,
*  and it feels like all the political negotiating experience in the world is not enough for me to
*  get our three-year-old son and our three-year-old daughter to just wash their hands and sit at the
*  table.
*  It's the part of our day when politics seems the most distant.
*  And yet the makeup of our kitchen table, the existence of my family, is just one example of
*  something that was literally impossible as recently as 25 years ago when an anxious teenager growing
*  up in Indiana wondered if he would ever find belonging in this world.
*  This kind of life went from impossible to possible, from possible to real, from real to
*  almost ordinary in less than half a lifetime.
*  Lauren Henry Yes, as someone who loves literary language,
*  I thought that that was so beautiful.
*  So a word that keeps coming to mind as I watch is rebrand.
*  And we've talked about freedom.
*  We've talked about some other dimensions of that.
*  But I think if you listen to the subtleties of some of the language here, you hear an
*  attempt to rebrand politics and rebrand government.
*  And just to give some specific examples, in our episode yesterday, you mentioned Raphael
*  Warnock's line that a vote is a kind of prayer.
*  Aaron Ross Oh, yeah.
*  By the way, Raphael Warnock should just be on any list like that of the power of the covers.
*  Lauren Henry Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
*  Aaron Ross He gave a great speech at the convention.
*  And then in the Buddha Judge speech last night that you mentioned, he has this line
*  that politics, or a certain kind of politics, importantly, quote, can make an impossible
*  dream into an everyday reality.
*  And there he's talking about just the daily experience of sitting in his kitchen
*  with his husband and his twin children, which is something that quite literally would have
*  been impossible in the 90s, legally, socially.
*  And he elsewhere describes politics as a kind of soul craft.
*  There's a kind of spiritual dimension here, I think a very moving humane dimension.
*  And I'm just kind of curious where you think that's coming from and how that has struck
*  you as you've watched and listened.
*  Raphael Warnock I mean, this to me is an old strain of the
*  Democratic Party.
*  Democrats believe in government.
*  They believe in the government's ability to make your life better.
*  And that also means Democrats, or many Democrats, believe in politics.
*  And there are different ways Democrats believe in politics.
*  One way can be the politics is a way that the working class or the majority of Americans
*  can band together to overturn the power and dominance of the rich of corporations.
*  But there's also a way in which they believe in politics for its pluralism,
*  for its ability to build and strengthen bonds in a country that might otherwise come apart,
*  I mean, this is a very old vision of politics, right?
*  Politics is how you work through disagreement without coming to war.
*  You heard Obama quoting Abraham Lincoln on the eve of the Civil War,
*  talking about the need to renew our bonds of affection.
*  You heard both Obama and Bill Clinton.
*  And I think this was important parts of their not just speeches, but what they were trying to tell
*  the generation coming up, talking about how important it is in politics to talk with the
*  people you disagree, to not demean them, to be open to them, to make space for them,
*  even in disagreement, to make sure they know that you will govern for them and you will keep them
*  in mind and you will respect them, even if they're not where you are.
*  So there's been a real strain in this convention around politics not as war,
*  which I think is often how Donald Trump portrays it, right?
*  This is our final battle, right?
*  I am your vengeance.
*  But politics is pluralism.
*  Politics is a thing that isn't supposed to drive us apart, but is supposed to help us
*  come together or stay together.
*  And that to me was why Buddha's speech was so powerful.
*  He did a better job than anybody else did at connecting these grand things that happen in
*  politics, these huge challenges and conflicts and campaigns and organizing efforts that it's easy
*  to say politics doesn't do anything, right?
*  There's so much cynicism about what politics can do.
*  But here he is saying politics has made my Tuesday night possible.
*  It has changed the most fundamental thing in my life, which is can I marry the person I love?
*  And can I have two beautiful children who I can't get to eat dinner and like cannot
*  get out the door in the morning?
*  So relatable.
*  Right?
*  Yeah, very relatable.
*  But that it was that weaving of the texture of the extraordinary and the ordinary.
*  Which he said very explicitly, again, that to me was his power.
*  And it's why it felt very Clintonian to me.
*  That's what Bill Clinton used to do very well.
*  Yeah, I think Buddha Judge is a really good representative of kind of this new class or new
*  generation of Democrats that we're really seeing on display.
*  You know, it's just true that after Obama in 2016 and 2020, even up till a month or two ago,
*  the candidates just have been older.
*  Hillary Biden, you know, Bernie being sort of the radical up and comer.
*  But to me, this convention has felt like a damn breaking.
*  All these people coming in and really kind of seizing the limelight in a way.
*  And so what has felt exciting or meaningful about this to you as you've watched the past three nights?
*  The Democratic Party just has a lot of talent in it right now.
*  And it has a lot of communicative talent.
*  In a way, I'm not sure people realize was true in say 2020.
*  You can talk about your Buddha Judges, your Kamala Harris's.
*  But if you've ever been in a room with Wes Moore, I mean, that guy's charisma is like a clean energy source.
*  He just really lights up a room.
*  Shapiro, really, really good.
*  Kim Walls, nobody saw that coming.
*  It's not the same kind of charisma as some of the others.
*  But wow, can that guy break through in the media?
*  I mean, he came out of nowhere to become the vice president through sheer skill of communication.
*  AOC gave a speech on the first night that completely brought the house down.
*  There's been movement in terms of his leadership, including, by the way, Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer,
*  handing over power to a new generation of leaders in the house, led by Hakeem Jeffries,
*  who is himself quite a phenomenal speaker.
*  If you imagine what a primary would have looked like in this year or in 2028,
*  you can imagine a lot of people running at the moment.
*  And I think one of the other interesting things about it is that the energy in the party is not just ideological.
*  It's also very pragmatic.
*  Democrats have been very interested in who knows how to win Pennsylvania.
*  That's why Shapiro has become such a big figure.
*  Who knows how to win in Michigan?
*  That's part of why Gretchen Whitmer has become such a big figure.
*  So you have the people coming ideologically, the people coming through raw charisma,
*  the people who are coming because they have proven how to do something Democrats want to be able to do,
*  which is win the key Midwestern and Sunbelt states that Democrats need to win in
*  to keep MAGA Republicans out of power.
*  And this convention has been a real showcase for that.
*  And I think you really see that in the sequencing, right?
*  Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton on night one, whether you like this or not,
*  that was a night that was about turning the page.
*  The Obamas on night two, that was a night about passing the torch.
*  The lineup of Buttigieg and Westmore and Josh Shapiro and Tim Walz on night three,
*  that was about the rising generation.
*  And then tonight, which is going to be about Kamala Harris,
*  now the leader of the Democratic Party.
*  And if she wins in November, the leader of it for some time to come,
*  much more so than any convention I've covered.
*  This convention has been the old guard giving way to the new.
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Let's close with a bit more on Tim Walz.
*  I think one thing that he did early in his speech, and we can play a clip,
*  is try to kind of recast what government is and what its function is and almost destigmatize it.
*  TIM WALZ Growing up in a small town like that, you'll learn how to take care of each other.
*  That family down the road, they may not think like you do.
*  They may not pray like you do.
*  They may not love like you do.
*  But they're your neighbors.
*  And you look out for them.
*  And they look out for you.
*  Everybody belongs.
*  And everybody has a responsibility to contribute.
*  For me, it was serving in the Army National Guard.
*  I joined up two days after my 17th birthday,
*  and I proudly wore our nation's uniform for 24 years.
*  My dad, a Korean War-era Army veteran, died of lung cancer a couple years later.
*  He left behind a mountain of medical debt.
*  Thank God for Social Security survivor benefits.
*  And thank God for the GI Bill that allowed my dad and me to go to college
*  and millions of other Americans.
*  And millions of other Americans.
*  SONIA DARA What is Walz doing there?
*  TIM WALZ I think one of Tim Walz's political talents
*  is making the argument for big government with the aesthetic of small communities.
*  But he doesn't argue it, you know, in the way that a Bernie Sanders might
*  or an AOC might.
*  He argues it as an expression of small state moral values.
*  Whether that connects, whether or not people buy that, I don't exactly know.
*  But I think you have to understand that is one of the things that makes him an
*  interesting communicator in the party.
*  He is able to give quite significant expansions of the state, quite significant new programs,
*  a very, very familiar spin.
*  And he does that in part by connecting that to his own life story and his own family.
*  His dad went on the GI Bill.
*  He went on the GI Bill.
*  I think it's powerful.
*  I think it's why he's on the ticket.
*  Tim Walz is on the ticket because he helps the ticket bridge the political experience
*  and appeal of Kamala Harris, which is fundamentally urban,
*  born in Oakland, California,
*  rises up in San Francisco to a strain of Democratic Party politics, a strain of
*  Democratic Party populism that is fundamentally rural, which has a very deep history in Minnesota.
*  The arena was not full of signs, as said Governor Walz.
*  The arena was full of signs that said, Coach Walz.
*  The videos about him were about his military service, about the children, I mean, now
*  adults he taught.
*  Before he came out, a bunch of people who played for his football team and are now adults
*  came out and stood in formation.
*  He is a weaponized Norman Rockwell painting that the Democrats have aimed directly at
*  JD Vance and Donald Trump.
*  I think that's a nice place to end.
