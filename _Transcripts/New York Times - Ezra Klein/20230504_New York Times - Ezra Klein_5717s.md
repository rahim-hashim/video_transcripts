# Best Of: How the Fed Is ‘Shaking the Entire System’
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [May 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oba6F_Qx7gc)
*  I'm Ezra Klein, and this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  The world has been transfixed for the last week by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and
*  Ukraine's remarkable heroic resistance to the same.
*  You can see these amazing, chilling images on social media, on traditional television.
*  And so it's easy to follow that side of the war, but that is not the only theater of this
*  war.
*  There's this other battle playing out in the financial markets, and that war is harder
*  to see, but in the past few days, it has escalated from a limited counterstrike into a ferocious
*  counterattack.
*  It is a war that might decide what happens ultimately in Ukraine, and it's a war whose
*  effects are not going to be limited to what happens in Ukraine.
*  We may well be watching the end of one global economic order and the birth of another.
*  The US and Europe were clear from the beginning.
*  They did not intend to get into a shooting war with Russia, not over Ukraine.
*  But they did intend to use a financial might to punish Russia if it invaded Ukraine.
*  They meant to sanction Russia to cause financial pain to the country and particularly to its
*  ruling class, but not to crack its economy, not to cause undue harm to their own economies,
*  which are now interwoven with Russia.
*  And so in this way, it looked like the logic of globalization had become inverted.
*  Rather than trade and interdependence restraining Russia from doing something like invading
*  Ukraine, it appeared to be restraining the West's ability to respond to Russia invading
*  Ukraine.
*  And that was where things stood on Friday.
*  But then social media, television, it filled with images and videos of the remarkable courage
*  of Ukraine's defenders, the indelible leadership of President Zelensky, the knowledge that
*  Russia was not just storming to the capital, that this was going to be much harder for
*  them than people had thought.
*  And all that together, it shamed Western leaders.
*  It changed the politics of the West.
*  And so by Monday, a limited economic punishment had become something else entirely, a full
*  out financial war.
*  Russia now stands on the precipice of economic collapse and Putin, Putin knows it.
*  He's treating this not as an annoyance, but as a mortal threat.
*  In response, he raised Russia's nuclear threat level.
*  He's responding to financial war with the threat of nuclear war, implying that if the
*  West broke his economy, he might break the world.
*  Which is all to say you cannot understand the war happening in Ukraine without understanding
*  the war happening around Russia's economy.
*  And so I wanted to have Adam Tooze on the show to explain it.
*  Tooze is director of the European Institute at Columbia University.
*  He's an absolutely brilliant economic historian, and he's the author of the invaluable newsletter
*  chart book, which I subscribe to and all of you should too.
*  Not all newsletters are worth it.
*  This one actually is.
*  And he's been closely tracking the economic dimensions of the conflict here.
*  And so I asked him to join me to analyze them.
*  But this is a bit of an unusual show.
*  We spoke on Friday, February 25th, but by Monday, by Monday, the situation had changed
*  in ways it demanded the analysis changed too.
*  But thinking about this and reading the conversation, I didn't want to edit it into a false omniscience.
*  The rapid, unpredictable way the conflict evolved.
*  That's really the point.
*  That's not some mistake.
*  So what you're going to hear here are two conversations.
*  First, our Friday discussion, which I think is really important because Tooze lays out
*  the economics of the conflict as it was understood by both sides at the beginning of the war.
*  You cannot understand how we got here without understanding what both sides predicted, what
*  they thought to be true.
*  But then on Monday, we talked again to discuss how it had changed so dramatically in just
*  a few short days, what that revealed about the false assumptions of the players and the
*  way that events are driving a rapid escalation.
*  Neither side expected and neither side planned for.
*  And I think when you sit with that, when you see how quickly this is changing, then you
*  realize actually what dangerous territory we're really in.
*  As always, my email is Ezra Klein show at NY times.com.
*  Adam Tooze, welcome back to the show.
*  Good to be here.
*  Sorry, it's under these circumstances, of course.
*  There's something you wrote a little while ago now that's been in my head watching this
*  play out, which is, quote, the first to expose the fact that global growth might produce
*  not harmony and convergence, but conflict and contradiction was Putin in 2007, 2008.
*  Tell me about that.
*  Yeah, I mean, the comment is framed now very much against our knowledge that with the clash
*  with China, that has become a much even bigger question.
*  But I do think that it originates in that moment in 2007, 2008 between Putin's now famous
*  speech to the Munich Security Conference in February and then the clash over Georgia.
*  And I think that's the moment when it becomes clear that not only do, as it were, the old
*  antagonists of the Cold War have resentful legacies, but those will take on a new significance
*  precisely as a result of the success of what was generally thought to be of the antithesis
*  of that old era of division, namely globalization, because globalization was supercharging the
*  development of Russia by way of the huge demand for raw materials unleashed by China's growth
*  from the 1990s onwards.
*  And so Putin, by 2006-07, is presiding over the restoration of a Russian state which has
*  emerged from the disastrous crisis of 1998.
*  By that point, I think the third largest holder of foreign exchange reserves, one of the largest
*  owners of American sovereign debt, and has paid back the IMF loans and all the financial
*  humiliations in the 90s.
*  And precisely on the basis, if you like, of Russia's raw material strength is now in a
*  position to actually state his red lines, which are essentially the same as the ones
*  that he's prosecuting now that he doesn't accept, as it were, the order that emerged
*  from the 1990s.
*  But he was able to do it on the basis of economic strength.
*  And that economic strength is itself the result of our demand, the West's demand, or the collective
*  global economy's demand for the raw materials which, with which Russia is so richly endowed.
*  And that is a huge problem.
*  I mean, that's a huge wrinkle in the underlying conception of globalization from the 1990s,
*  which was much more Panglossian, much more Polyanaish, right?
*  That fundamentally believed that everything was good in the world and that more economic
*  growth would produce convergence or harmony and dukomest, right?
*  This idea that through exchange we would grow closer together.
*  I think that was the moment where we really began to get a flavor for the fact and a sense
*  of the fact that that might not be the case.
*  Give me a moment of the Panglossian view.
*  Give me a taste of the argument that as we grow, as we integrate, as our economies intertwine
*  — this is sounding vaguely romantic, I realize — that the economic logic of globalization,
*  that there are gains to trade, we'll get cheaper things, our economies will grow, also
*  has a geopolitical logic, also has a geostrategic logic.
*  Why did people think these were tastes that went together?
*  Well, I think there is a kind of romantic feel to it.
*  There is a wanting to have your cake and eat it kind of liberal logic here, which one shouldn't
*  deny.
*  Wouldn't it be good if it were true?
*  Within the legally settled spaces of nation states, liberalism is very heavily committed
*  to this idea.
*  It is analogously leery of any reference to class war.
*  It doesn't like that either.
*  It doesn't like the idea that economic growth could generate massive inequality and not
*  just inequality, but sharp polarized division at home either.
*  So it's a kind of double blind spot.
*  The idea at the international level is that, yes, in a sense, nation states are kind of
*  excrescents, right?
*  They shouldn't be there.
*  Really fundamentally, humanity is tied together by certain common interests, which are satisfied
*  in this view and optimally satisfied by peaceful and free exchange and the common pursuit of
*  innovation and prosperity.
*  And furthermore, when you have a structure like that in place, you would expect it to
*  cement powerful interests on all sides that would then resist war.
*  It's what Polanyi called the peace interest.
*  So powerful, heavy hitting groups, not just as it were sentimental attitudes, but that
*  resist the onset of conflict because it ruptures those trade relations.
*  It has a romantic side, but there is also a kind of realist version of this, which says,
*  well, if in the end money talks, you'd expect money to talk peace quite a lot of the time.
*  And that, I think, is the idea.
*  And there are moments in the 90s, there are moments beyond the 90s when this doesn't seem
*  like an implausible idea.
*  In fact, all the way down to the present day, one has to really pinch oneself to believe
*  this is happening, given the losses that are being inflicted on no doubt powerful and influential
*  people in Russia at this moment.
*  I mean, the oligarchs are not doing well out of this.
*  If you think about analogous conflicts around Taiwan or something like that, the global
*  semiconductor industry isn't just a supply chain.
*  It's one of humanity's great technological scientific achievements.
*  Our ability to do this stuff at nanoscale is us up against the face of God, in a sense.
*  And it happens to be in Taiwan.
*  And are we seriously going to talk about D-Day style amphibious operations and dig trenches
*  and attach explosive devices to fabs, which are the human spirit incarnate?
*  Like there's something totally incongruous about this, right?
*  They are also capitalism and they also have geopolitical consequences.
*  That's the fly in the ointment.
*  But anyway, if you wanted to tie down that liberal vision and give it meat, I don't think
*  we should deny it and cast it off as childish stuff.
*  There's a profound rationality there.
*  And historically, there are moments when it's clearly vindicated.
*  And in the right space, with the right framing, it can be very generative.
*  And indeed, these logics work themselves out.
*  And the Europeans, of course, insist that they are the very paradigm of that logic.
*  So Russia for the past decade, maybe more, has been inflicting, exposing the problems
*  of this logic on the world.
*  But before that, the problems of the logic are inflicted upon Russia.
*  And I want to go back to that history for a couple of minutes here, because I think
*  it's important that the Soviet Union falls.
*  American investors and economists and advisors flood into the country as it opens up.
*  There's this idea that Russia will become this economic miracle, the shock therapy.
*  It'll become this economic miracle as all these Western economic ideas meet all this
*  productive might and untapped genius and potential.
*  And then it doesn't.
*  So what happens?
*  What goes wrong in the immediate post-Soviet Union effort to turn the Russian economy into
*  a Westernized success story?
*  Well, I think the first thing to say is that it was always a gamble at like extremely long
*  odds, right?
*  I think you have to go back to the late Soviet period to see just how blocked the political
*  economy of the Soviet Union had become, how the Communist Party, unlike in China, had
*  essentially become a kind of bracket around a pre-oligarchic configuration of interest
*  groups in agriculture, in heavy industry, in the military-industrial complex.
*  And that's essentially what, as it were, creates the impasse, which produces then a very serious
*  hyperinflationary problem in the end, to which anyone in charge of Russia at that moment
*  would probably have had to have responded with the shock therapy element, which is the
*  price liberalization, which was really not a whole hell of a lot of other options there.
*  The bad politics really begins, and it's largely outside the influence of foreign experts at
*  the moment of privatization.
*  And it's the extraordinarily corrupt process through which the assets of the Soviet Union
*  were disposed in the mid-90s, really, that produces the move in the wrong, what I think
*  many people would regard as the move in the wrong direction.
*  I mean, modern Russia is not, after all, an economic basket case.
*  This is another important point to make.
*  The story now ends with disappointment rather than disaster, but the possibility of a kind
*  of a liberal democratic model was probably obviated at that time.
*  Furthermore, of course, the West has a limited degree of influence over this, but we back,
*  after all, Yeltsin, who presides over this, who navigates his way through this oligarchic
*  division, including in his violent standoff with his opponents in the Russian Parliament,
*  including in the manipulation of the 1996 election, isn't it, that he wins, but it's
*  quite clearly a manipulated outcome.
*  And then nothing we do from the outside, nothing we provide can stave off the disaster into
*  which Russia slides in 1998, which is crippling.
*  And this is a moment where a nuclear-armed ex-superpower, you know, is basically, most
*  of its economy is dollarized.
*  People are paying their taxes in dollars.
*  It's really showing all of the signs of a disintegrating, dysfunctional failed state
*  by that point.
*  And the story of Putin is not understandable, except against that backdrop.
*  I mean, the basic claim to legitimacy on his part, and it's not easy to just sort of wipe
*  away, is that he has rescued Russia from that.
*  Now, obviously, a critical political analysis would say, you know, a variety of contributing
*  factors beyond Putin's, you know, iron determination.
*  But that backdrop is critical.
*  But how does he, or the variety of contributing factors, rescue Russia from that?
*  What is the capsule story of the foundation upon which the Russian economy is rebuilt
*  from disaster into disappointment?
*  The fundamental distinction, I think, even like supporters of Putin would make, is that
*  it went from being a kleptocratic, crony capitalist regime to being a state capitalist regime.
*  And the fundamental story here is the reconstruction of the apparatus of the Russian state.
*  It's very complex.
*  And, you know, the Kremlinologists of the modern day have five, six, seven, eight different
*  groups now that they see operating around Putin.
*  But the trend is take advantage as best you can of the resources that oil and gas and
*  other, you know, metallurgical exports and also now increasingly ag exports are delivering
*  to you.
*  But don't be the failed petro state of the 1990s, be a high functioning authoritarian
*  regime, more like, I don't know, one of the Gulf states, or an authoritarian version of
*  a Norway, if you like to put it really provocatively, with a fairly considerable welfare state by
*  emerging market standards and a huge foreign exchange reserve.
*  So one of the indices of this restoration of the state is the fiscal balance.
*  And Russia, one of the reasons why Russian sovereign debt was beloved of foreign investors
*  until last week is that Russia runs a very tight ship fiscally.
*  One of their commitments is not to allow runaway inflation anymore.
*  And they set their budget target, I think the latest round will set it, you know, they
*  index it on the dollar price of oil.
*  And I think they will set the budget to balance at an oil price of forty five dollars a barrel,
*  which by the standard of petro states is really austere.
*  I mean, the Gulf states set their budgets to balance at 70, 80, 90.
*  So all of these are indicators of this consolidation of state power.
*  But so crucially there, I want to draw something out that you said, which is Russia becomes
*  a major export driven economy.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's exporting commodities, exporting energy, agriculture.
*  But to the point that we're beginning to draw here on globalization, what is happening is
*  that Russia rebuilds by selling things, it mines, it grows and that to some degree it
*  produces to the rest of the world and very particularly to Europe.
*  I was looking at a breakdown of Russian exports and I think we're something like three point
*  five percent of them.
*  America is actually not huge in this, but I mean, Europe is a lot of Russia.
*  And of course, China has become much, much bigger, too.
*  And so, I mean, Russia really does participate in a globalized economy and begin selling
*  what it can pull out of its own ground to the rest of the world.
*  Yeah, it always has.
*  I mean, this is a long, long tradition.
*  Russia has always been, I mean, you know, come this light oil Dutch shell, a large part
*  of that business was originally the Rothschild Caucasus Oil Interest that was incorporated.
*  It's always been a breadbasket.
*  It's always been a metallurgical sector for certain key metallurgy.
*  So, yeah, it's a Eurasian powerhouse of raw material supply.
*  And that's the knock computing, right?
*  I mean, any half decent administration of this pile of raw materials given Chinese demand
*  should have delivered seven, eight, nine percent growth.
*  That's the liberal knock.
*  And that's where the disappointment comes in, which is it's all very well to crow about
*  this huge resurrection of the Russian state.
*  But you're setting a relatively low bar here.
*  You know, a well administered rule of law regime could conceivably have attracted even
*  more foreign capital than Russia did.
*  And it attracted considerable amounts and could have produced even more welfare.
*  Ukraine is caught between the powerhouse state type model of Russia and the powerhouse EU
*  driven, market driven assimilation model, on the other hand, in the West.
*  And unsurprisingly, this creates a kind of given Ukraine's lamentable economic performance,
*  it creates this kind of, they're not schizophrenic exactly, but this hugely oscillating self-positioning
*  of Ukraine.
*  I mean, do they associate themselves with the more oligarchic Russian model or do they,
*  many of their citizens would prefer to align themselves with the Polish experience.
*  But those are the benchmarks against which is the kind of triangle, right, of different
*  experiences that help to locate what's going on here.
*  So Russia's buildup of a large foreign exchange reserve has come up glancingly a couple of
*  times.
*  You write, if you want a single variable that sums up Russia's position as a strategic
*  petrostate, it is Russia's foreign exchange reserve.
*  And you go on to say, this is what gives Putin his freedom of strategic maneuver.
*  So tell me two things here.
*  One is that foreign exchange reserve may not be the most familiar term to people.
*  So what is it?
*  And then why is it the core of Putin's ability to invade Ukraine, to survive this, to strategically
*  maneuver on the world stage?
*  Yeah, I mean, a foreign exchange reserve on the scale the Russians have it is, is you
*  start from the premises of the liberal private sector based economy, a kind of anomalous
*  thing, because what it is is a hoarding by some public agency, it could be the central
*  bank, it could be the treasury, it could be a sovereign wealth fund of the foreign currency
*  proceeds of an export surplus.
*  It's difficult to accumulate one of these if you're not running a trade surplus.
*  But the trade surplus is in a private sector economy, generally earned by private firms.
*  It's been a long time since America's run one, so it's hard to kind of invoke examples.
*  But say Germany does, right?
*  And Germany doesn't have a giant trade foreign exchange reserve because the companies that
*  earn the foreign exchange are, you know, Porsche, BMW, whatever.
*  They don't they don't have any direct relationship with VW is actually state owned, but it doesn't
*  feed into a state coffer.
*  Whereas in states like Russia or China, there is, as it were, a systematic process of accumulating
*  foreign claims, claims on foreign economies in public hands.
*  That requires kind of abstention on the part of the state, right?
*  You have to commit to not spending this because you could be spending this on goodies you
*  could be importing from abroad.
*  So you're not.
*  You're deliberately using it's like a blend of trade policy and fiscal policy to constitute
*  a cash reserve.
*  Why would you do that?
*  Because you want to be invulnerable against shocks from the outside.
*  You don't want to be in a position where your currency is devaluing in an uncontrollable
*  way.
*  Your import bill, because that's denominated in foreign currency, is surging, making the
*  cost of living go crazy for ordinary folks who have to buy the foreign goods.
*  You don't want your debtors who've borrowed money in foreign currencies to suddenly be
*  made bankrupt by the fact that their debts are now worth vastly more in local currency
*  than they used to be because your currency is devalued.
*  All of this is what happened to Russia in 1998.
*  And if you've got half a trillion dollars in foreign exchange reserve, you can do a whole
*  variety of things in that kind of situation.
*  You don't need to worry about being able to import stuff because you can cover your import
*  bill for years in the Russian case.
*  You can, if necessary, sell those dollars into the market for rubles, which helps you
*  prop up the value of the ruble.
*  And that will then allow your debtors to buy time to pay off their debts, settle their
*  debts by hook or by crook so that by some point then they can survive the devaluation,
*  which may in due course be inevitable.
*  And what Russia has not just done, it's not just run up this public foreign exchange fund.
*  It is also since 2013-14, the last Ukraine crisis, systematically squeezed down on the
*  counterpart of that, which often shows up in national balance sheets, which is private
*  debts in foreign currency.
*  So that's, as it were, really, that's this next level element of their hardening of the
*  Russian economy.
*  It's not just first step, build up a big dollar reserve.
*  But the second step is look around every other aspect of Russian society and economy and
*  shrink any outstanding liabilities in dollars.
*  And they've done both bits.
*  And that means that they are not exactly sanctions proof, but they are not going to panic when,
*  as we saw in the last couple of days, the ruble plunges, foreign debtors will no longer
*  run.
*  Basically, the Russian government can't borrow foreign creditors anymore.
*  It's certainly not in the last week.
*  So it doesn't need to.
*  So that's the resilience that you get there.
*  So I really want to hold on this for a minute because it's probably some unfamiliar territory.
*  But I think this is so important for understanding the logic of the situation.
*  We are so used to thinking of wars in terms of how many troops do you have?
*  How many missiles?
*  What kinds of technologies do you have?
*  And what you're saying here is that Russia has spent years building up, on the one hand,
*  a storehouse of dollars to some degree, euros, such that if they get cut off from being able
*  to get lots of dollars in euros, it doesn't really matter.
*  They can survive that.
*  And then on the other hand, bringing down the debts and thus leverage that their private
*  sector players absorbed such that Western actors would have leverage over them.
*  They have actually spent years using the tools of globalization to harden their economy against
*  the weaponry of globalization.
*  That if you think of one of the ideas in globalization, it would create a kind of economic harmony.
*  If you think of the stick next to that carrot, it's that well, if you're deeply entangled in the global
*  economy and you become a bad actor, then you can be cut off.
*  And if you're cut off from that trade, if you're cut off from that ability to participate in the
*  financial system, if you're cut off from the ability to get the currencies in which a lot of your
*  transactions are denominated, then your suffering will be immense.
*  But what they've kind of been doing is playing one side, but not the other.
*  They've been participating in the global economy and building up their reserves and hardening in that
*  way, but at the same time, purposefully reducing their vulnerability to the sticks of sanctions and
*  so on, which we're about to talk about in detail.
*  Yeah, I mean, the buzzword here is weaponized interdependence.
*  And there's a whole bunch of scholars, colleagues who've been working on that issue.
*  And I think it's important to recognize, I mean, in the first instance, this was not part, I think,
*  of an expansive revisionist geopolitical vision.
*  I think in the first instance, it was a recovery from the 1998 trauma, which was severe.
*  And I think it's difficult for us, you know, sitting in confluent, affluent, relatively stable
*  societies to really understand quite how severe that shock was.
*  I mean, Russia in 98, at one point, I think appeals for food aid.
*  I mean, like we're really talking about an existential crisis.
*  But yes, undoubtedly, this is true that Russia, you know, pursues it's a typical medium strategy,
*  medium power strategy or an insurgent type strategy.
*  It has to take a comprehensive view of the exercise of power globally because it doesn't have
*  the privilege of economic dominance.
*  Right. So it knows that it's vulnerable.
*  It knows if it wants to have autonomy.
*  And with that, if it wants to realize what sovereignty actually means, in other words,
*  your ability to take action on your own terms, not indefinitely without any constraint,
*  but by yourself, a degree of room for maneuver, then you need to think across the bandwidth of
*  options. And you can't treat economics as separate from the other dimensions of power,
*  which is the conceit of liberalism.
*  But I think they understand that as also the hypocrisy of liberalism, because they don't think
*  that we, the Americans or the West, really do either.
*  It's just that the game has gone so far our way that we can proclaim the endless future of
*  economic prosperity, of joint economic prosperity.
*  And what that really just means is an endless future of our power and our dominance.
*  And if you're coming at it from their angle, they do indeed always need to see the other side.
*  And we cannot ignore the history of the 90s and the early 2000s without getting into kind of moral
*  equivalence and whataboutism.
*  And just causally to understand what the Russians are doing, you have to see the way in which they
*  make sense of Iran, Iraq, Kosovo, that entire realm of essentially discretionary action by major
*  Western powers on their own terms.
*  And Russia has indeed been preparing for that.
*  So during the Cold War, one of the definitional features of the Cold War is a willingness on the
*  part of the West to commit or at least threaten force.
*  We commit force in Vietnam.
*  There's the standoff in Cuba and the fear is this will go all the way up to nuclear war.
*  Over the past months, the Biden administration, to their credit, has been saying Russia is going to
*  invade Ukraine.
*  They have been raising the alarm.
*  They have been called alarmist for it.
*  A lot of people doubted the intelligence.
*  They were right.
*  But they have also made perfectly clear that if Russia invades Ukraine, they are not going to
*  commit troops.
*  For all that we knew this was coming or the administration knew it was coming, there was not a
*  decision made to say line up American or NATO troops on the Ukrainian border.
*  And the signal is if Russia does this, they will be punished economically with sanctions.
*  So before we get into specifically what the sanctions are, what are sanctions?
*  What is the intention of this kind of weapon?
*  What do they do and what do they not do?
*  Well, I mean, it's a hugely contested field.
*  And, you know, there's a brilliant new book out by Nick Mulder on the economic weapon that
*  addresses the history of sanctions.
*  And they have a really kind of complex and twisted history, as he shows, that they're kind of
*  liberalism's favorite weapon.
*  I mean, they're kind of they're on a spectrum, which is an ugly spectrum that starts with
*  blockades, siege warfare, economic sanctions, and then goes to things like strategic bombing and
*  ultimately various types of deterrent strategy.
*  And they're all forms of the exercise of power and indeed coercion and violence.
*  I think we should be clear short of the classic battlefield entanglement or naval warfare or
*  aerial combat.
*  They may, in fact, entail certainly regularly do entail naval combat and or at least naval
*  interdiction and aerial interdiction.
*  But they fit in that kind of space.
*  I mean, the sanctions that we think about now are peculiarly legalized product of a
*  century of experimentation, which all starts really in its modern form with the League of Nations,
*  or you could say it starts with the British, French and ultimately American blockade of Germany in
*  World War One, and then is adopted by the League of Nations in the 1920s, the forerunner to the U.N.,
*  as the world community's ultimate weapon, nonviolent, quote unquote, against somebody who
*  transgresses the laws of peace.
*  And so rather than yourself having to go to war against an aggressor, what you do is you impose
*  economic sanctions, which are either supposed to be a deterrent to prevent action.
*  And that will work best against small actors for whom the prospect of sanctions is crushing.
*  Or it could be a form of siege.
*  In other words, you punish the bad actor and hope that attritionally this will affect their
*  choices. Could be as a result of a domestic uprising or it could be as a result of elite
*  simply saying, look, boss, we've got to change course, this isn't going well.
*  Or it could be functional.
*  In other words, they just can't carry on.
*  That's the risk which any potential challenger in the global system now knows that they could
*  face. I mean, after the experience of Iran or Venezuela or North Korea, whatever.
*  So Joe Biden, when he lays down the second and harsher tranche of sanctions here, he says,
*  quote, no one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening.
*  So explicitly, he says these are not deterrents, which is to say in the typology you just
*  offered, they're siege.
*  And so he says, well, you know, the sanctions are not deterrent.
*  They're not deterrent.
*  They're not deterrent.
*  They're not deterrent.
*  In the typology you just offered, they're siege.
*  But you've looked at these pretty closely.
*  What did we do in the sanctions and what didn't we do?
*  I mean, the president was actually, I mean, given given his delivery, it's always quite
*  difficult to discern what his main point is.
*  And this isn't to say he's incoherent.
*  It's just something about his delivery that is strangely unfocused.
*  But he was, in fact, quite frank about what the sanctions are doing.
*  And what I think the model here is on both the European and the American part is that
*  they are going to surgically strike at the bits that hurt inside Putin's regime.
*  I mean, he's literally said he kind of mumbled it out, but it's right there in what
*  Biden said. These sanctions are carefully calibrated not to interrupt payment for
*  energy deliveries.
*  Now, at that point, really, the game should stop because if we're not interrupting the
*  payment for energy deliveries, we are not hitting the bit of the Russian economy, which
*  generates the juice which sustains Putin's regime.
*  Now, they could then say, well, that isn't the point.
*  Our point is this targeted attack on the political elite and the targeted attack on
*  key financial institutions.
*  They are being cut out of the entire dollar correspondence system, which means it really
*  won't be able to do international banking very easily.
*  And I think the idea must be if you strike at those two elements, the financial
*  infrastructure and the elites that you're going to produce an effect.
*  And I think reporting suggests from inside that there was a somewhat, I mean,
*  understandably multisided debate in the Biden administration about whether or not this
*  would work as a deterrent. You can't but hope that it will.
*  But now, I think given the worst has happened, clearly they'll say, no, that was never
*  the plan. And in fact, always this is about this kind of change.
*  But having exempted the energy sector, they are not.
*  And again, they're very clear about the motives for that, right, because because, I mean,
*  it will hurt the Europeans and it'll hurt American consumers too badly.
*  I mean, in the American consumer case, it's I think a more I mean, it's more of a stretch.
*  But in any case, that's the logic. It's quite explicit.
*  And so they're trying this more targeted, smarter sanctions kind of model.
*  I want to get at something important there because we are talking we're speaking we're in
*  America, despite your lovely accent, and we are talking about the Biden
*  administration as the actor.
*  But the sanctions are not simply a Biden administration operation.
*  They're in consultation with Europe and talking about Biden's
*  lines and the places where he's a little bit unexpectedly honest.
*  Two things here. One is we understand this has been said pretty clearly.
*  It has been reported quite clearly, actually going back months now, that Germany has
*  lobbied and pushed for the sanction exemption on energy.
*  Yeah. And we can talk about more of the specifics there.
*  But but there's a real European fear about cutting off Russian, particularly natural
*  gas is my understanding.
*  And then secondarily, there was a possibility being floated to cut Russia
*  out of the swift system, which is international financial machinery that I will let you
*  explain its function.
*  They did not do that at least yet.
*  And it's possible that they will in the coming days.
*  They did not do that yet.
*  And Biden, somewhat to my surprise, says in his comments that that is because the
*  Europeans would not agree to do it.
*  Yeah. So can you talk a bit here about these decisions and the role that Europe's
*  integration with Russia is playing?
*  Because it's funny, it really inverts the logic of globalization creating harmony.
*  You're seeing here that it also creates a leverage of the bad actor on those who would
*  like to maintain harmony.
*  No, absolutely. I mean, there are three separate issues.
*  So one is whether or not it's illegal to conduct transactions with Russian actors
*  through the right kind of intermediary around things like energy.
*  And the Europeans and the Americans seem determined to greenlight that.
*  Then there are the sanctions which Biden did announce, which, as he insisted, and I
*  think quite rightly, expert opinion seems to concur, are really massive, which are to
*  block the assets of Russian banks in the United States for some of them and for others
*  just excise them from the dollar based interbank relationships.
*  So this is this correspondence banking, which Biden announced.
*  He was then asked by journalists, Mr. President, what about Swift?
*  And Swift is the thing that everyone's been talking about.
*  And it's become this sort of standard of whether you are hardcore on sanctions.
*  Do you favor cutting the Russians out of Swift?
*  And I think the smart money says, well, actually, the correspondence banking thing
*  does that to a considerable extent.
*  And in any case, the real issue is energy.
*  And if you're exempting that doesn't matter what you do.
*  But Swift is it's kind of like as far as I understand it, it's like an email system
*  for banks. It's a form of secure, rapid, efficient digital communication between
*  international banks. It's not government to government.
*  Those central banks may have swift numbers.
*  It's a club, essentially, and it's not based in America.
*  It's based in Brussels. And it's a private entity.
*  And the idea is that, as it were, if America threatens actors on the Russian side,
*  then people who do business with them through Swift will become liable.
*  Swift itself could become liable for one of those really nasty American lawsuits
*  with which they have hounded both European and Asian bankers and business people.
*  And so Swift will then, as it were, just choose to exclude Russian members from its
*  system. And that would hamper their ability to do conventional international banking.
*  I think the consensus now is that if you push the correspondence banking measures,
*  which Biden imposed yesterday, or announced the imposition of, then that actually does the
*  work. But yes, both with regard to the energy carve out and with regard to, you know,
*  swift and forceful action on Swift, which would be stigmatizing because the previous
*  countries to have been cut out are Iran, Venezuela.
*  So it would put Russia in that box.
*  Europe pushed back and pushed back quite hard.
*  And they pushed back for existential reasons, right?
*  Because 50 percent of the natural gas on which a large part of German power generation,
*  domestic heating and cooking fuel and industrial raw, you know, feedstock depends
*  would be cut off. And the German government doesn't want to contemplate that any more
*  than Biden in a midterm election year wants to contemplate a dramatic spike in gas
*  prices. So we're going to get at this explicitly later.
*  But but I just want to note as we go through this part of the conversation that if China
*  is in your head here, I don't think you're wrong to have that as a subtext.
*  And I say that in part for this question, which is, I think we're seeing that on energy
*  almost no matter what they do, because a direct invasion of Ukraine is about the single
*  largest violation of international law and norm you can possibly imagine.
*  It just doesn't get bigger. Russia is just too big to fail.
*  They are too big to sanction.
*  They have just attained a centrality to the global market where no matter what they do,
*  you know, within imagination, Germany and the UK and so on are just going to say, well,
*  that was bad, but not so bad that we are going to absorb the cost of cutting you out.
*  I broadly speaking agree. That's exactly the but but it depends a little bit on the
*  conjuncture in the sense that the oil and gas markets at this particular moment are as
*  tight as they've been in living memory. Right.
*  So so that makes things even worse.
*  And it's just not obvious, for instance, that if you take, you know, three million bavils
*  of Russian oil exports a day out of the market, that Saudi Arabia can stack up to match that
*  missing supply. I think in fact, we know for a fact they probably cannot.
*  Yeah, they absolutely can't. And likewise, gas is even more complicated because it
*  requires either pipelines or liquefaction and then G terminals.
*  And that's a five to 10 year time horizon, massive investment.
*  And we just don't have the capacity for that.
*  So it's it's those particular constraints.
*  I mean, you know, people talk about this is a completely irrational move on Russia's
*  part. They've been timing this.
*  You know, this was certainly the year to do it, not 2020 when oil prices went negative
*  briefly. So they are indeed a really hard to sanction at this particular moment.
*  And in the grain market, they're an even bigger deal.
*  Right. So between them, Ukraine and Russia supply 23 percent of the global
*  stock of wheat exports, global flow of wheat exports.
*  So that's staggeringly large up to in that space.
*  And if I'm not wrong, though, agricultural and in fact, commodity and ag experts in
*  general are also exempted under the sanctions.
*  Surprise, surprise. They are. Yeah.
*  And in a under a rubric, which also includes like medicines and yes, they are.
*  Yes, that's general license six.
*  Maybe the energy one is general license eight.
*  And so apparently there was panic buying in.
*  We are the first people to learn this.
*  Like there's a panic buying of loaves of bread across the Middle East, which are
*  heavily dependent on Ukraine and Russian grain until somebody informed the bakery
*  shops. In Lebanon, in fact, general license six applied and they literally put
*  up, you know, posters in their store windows saying no American sanctions will not
*  apply to agricultural goods. So where people are actually sensitively dependent on
*  this rather than it just being a kind of abstract discussion like the one that we're
*  having, the knowledge of the limits of these sanctions is fairly widespread.
*  Although I'm still quite worried about this piece of it.
*  I mean, this is we've been talking really about Russia here.
*  But but Ukraine itself is a massive weed provider.
*  Lebanon imports 50 percent of its weed from Ukraine.
*  Libya, 43 percent.
*  Yemen, 22 percent.
*  I mean, Yemen is in a disastrous state right now.
*  Bangladesh, 21 percent.
*  So you can exempt Russia wheat production, which will presumably continue relatively
*  unchanged. But Ukraine is being invaded by Russia.
*  Their wheat production is probably not going to continue unchanged.
*  And it does seem that the downstream consequences for fragile countries in their
*  food supply could be severe, especially against a backdrop again in food markets as
*  well of very elevated prices.
*  It's one of the you know, the untold neglected stories of the inflation surge is that
*  food price spike, which hits low income countries hardest.
*  So, I mean, global stocks are quite large.
*  So I think there shouldn't be absolute shortages, but the price squeeze, especially
*  for low income countries, could be very severe.
*  And Ukraine is a low cost.
*  You know, it's a kind of bargain basement wheat provider.
*  So it does its clients do tend to be lower income.
*  So we've been as you said, there's a strategic economic logic here.
*  We've been trying to lay out what Russia's is.
*  I think the way that the American and European sanction exemptions has been reported,
*  is this a kind of moral failure, an absence of the kind of backbone and commitment Putin
*  himself is showing here.
*  I think that you can read it the opposite way, too, given the history of very large
*  countries invading smaller countries that do not want to be invaded, which is if you
*  really loathe Russia, you can say Putin is doing something probably completely
*  disastrous for the Russian economy here, probably disastrous for Russia.
*  The financial system is about to get somewhat strangled.
*  They are about to be putting a tremendous amount of treasure and blood into trying to
*  conquer and then pacify and then maintain Ukraine.
*  America's had its own misadventures of this kind over the past few decades.
*  We're a richer country.
*  We're a bigger country.
*  We have more allies in that in those ventures.
*  And they have been, I would say, disastrous for America is again, from the real
*  politic approach.
*  Could you look at this and say Vladimir Putin has made an insane calculation here
*  and the West's interest is in letting him destroy his power on the shoals of this
*  imperialist, nostalgic fantasy.
*  That's definitely, as it were, the big liberal counter.
*  In other words, that liberal harmony vision of economic growth as a compelling
*  historical force will in the end come back to bite you and it'll bite you this way if
*  it doesn't get you the other.
*  I mean, if that is correct, then of course you have to reckon with the fact that Putin
*  already made his choice.
*  I mean, he made his choice in 14 with the annexation of Crimea and with the backing
*  of the separatists in Donbas.
*  The Russians have been living under sanctions of various types since then.
*  And the regime has shown a considerable ability to harden itself.
*  And I think probably Putin would shrug and say, well, that's a small price to pay for
*  the crowning of my legacy.
*  Putin made a strategic move, people reckon, I think, around 2013-14 to rebase the
*  legitimacy of his regime from the economic growth, the more conventional economic growth
*  welfare model that had prevailed from the late 90s through to that moment, 2013-14, to
*  one that was emphatically based on nationalism and appeals to history and to grandeur and
*  so on.
*  So I don't think we may want to characterise it as mad.
*  It has its own logic.
*  And the economic costs have been considerable but tolerable from the point of view of the
*  Russian regime so far and indeed of Russian society so far.
*  That isn't to say so when you talk to Russian liberals who are highly critical of this
*  direction, some of them closely associated with the previous regime, the regime that
*  prevailed up to 2013-14.
*  Their scenarios for Russia, admittedly before the current crisis, were dismal over the
*  20 to 30 year time horizon.
*  It has bad demographics.
*  Productivity growth is lame.
*  Becoming the privileged raw material supplier to China is no one's idea necessarily in
*  Russia, a high road to national prosperity and success.
*  But they're not of immediate collapse.
*  And I think that that's what's going to be tested in the next months and two years to
*  three years.
*  But the regime has already made that choice.
*  It made that choice back in 2013-14.
*  And what it discovers, of course, is that when the dust settles, the customers come
*  back.
*  Germany's dependence, Europe's dependence on Russian gas, has risen since the first
*  Ukrainian crisis up to this week.
*  It rose quite considerably.
*  So that I think is something they also know.
*  In other words, they have something other people want.
*  And given time, those customers and those clients will come back.
*  Could Russia do this without Chinese support?
*  China is now Russia's major trading partner.
*  And so if it didn't have China there, that would cause considerable problems.
*  It doesn't currently sell a huge amount of gas to China.
*  It does sell a lot of oil.
*  It certainly helps.
*  If China was vigorously opposed and aligned with the United States in opposing this, I
*  think the calculus would look very different from Russia's point of view.
*  But China isn't India is kind of ambiguous as well.
*  It's very much the outlines, if you like, of the coalitions of 2003.
*  Again, not to bring up old history, but if you want to see a map of our current
*  situation, look at the way opinion was divided in the United Nations in 2003.
*  And I think many of those states essentially share Russia's perspective that the
*  existing order, as we like to describe it, is fundamentally illegitimate and
*  inconsistent and hypocritical.
*  And so if any one of them has a beef sufficiently large that they want to pursue
*  it and America is as indicating as clearly as it is that it is not going to escalate
*  this beyond sanctions of a limited type, then they weigh the cost of distancing
*  themselves and aligning themselves.
*  I don't think Beijing necessarily wanted this problem here right now.
*  But if this is what Putin wants to do, they're not going to.
*  So this that alliance, I think, is quite conditional, quite pragmatic, but is rooted
*  in a fundamental alignment on this issue of the legitimacy of the existing order.
*  If you're Beijing, you're watching the European response, you're watching the
*  American response, what are you learning?
*  I think what you already knew.
*  I mean, I think they're very smart and there's nothing, there's nothing very
*  surprising about what we're seeing.
*  You're learning that America is refocusing.
*  I would have thought from Beijing's point of view, there's very little comfort in
*  this because America is not taking the bait, right?
*  And America is not deeply engaging on this issue.
*  They're drawing lines.
*  And I think the flip side of that is, you know, that America is serious about 10
*  years on from the, you know, the Obama pivot now really actually performing that
*  shift. That will be my read.
*  And you could read it just simply as weakness, but I don't think that's terribly
*  convincing, to be honest.
*  And you already knew that the Europeans, you know, don't have an independent
*  military capacity and are hugely exposed to Russia for a crucial input.
*  China's not in that same position with regard to the Europeans.
*  I mean, Europe is a huge market, it's a larger market for Chinese exports than
*  the United States even.
*  So there the exposure is more the other way around.
*  But I don't think that Beijing will be suddenly changing the parameters of its
*  calculus in any significant way.
*  If you're Taiwan right now, what are you learning from this situation?
*  I think exactly.
*  I think the Japanese also are looking at this very hard and thinking thoughts.
*  I mean, and you do have to wonder, don't you?
*  Because because one way of I mean, I'm going to talk about Europe just a second
*  more because it's where I'm more comfortable.
*  But clearly in Europe already, the conversation has started about in Germany,
*  like amongst serious people.
*  I mean, we really actually do have to have some military capacity.
*  This extraordinary moment for a German historian of seeing the head of the German
*  army on LinkedIn of all places, announcing his profound professional and personal
*  humiliation of the fact that as a German soldier, he has nothing, quote, nothing to
*  contribute to this situation.
*  So if you're Japanese or you're Taiwanese at this moment and you're watching this,
*  you must be wondering as to whether or not you do not need to stand by for a big
*  surge in defense spending to consolidate, as it were, themselves as hard and nuts.
*  And certainly, you know, the Japanese in that case, we've seen a tendency that's
*  very strongly in that direction.
*  And it's not been disapproved of in any way by the, you know, well, the Biden
*  administration is complicated, as we know, but there's certainly one group around
*  Kurt Campbell and folks like that that clearly have no problem with seeing a more
*  militarized, more robust local deterrent capacity on Japan's part, whether that
*  goes to the level of nuclearization, which might ultimately be the most, you know,
*  the final last ditch defensive mechanism.
*  I don't know, to be honest.
*  Taiwan's options are just so much more difficult.
*  I mean, it's difficult as a historian and you step back and you go to kind of
*  aestheticizing modes, right?
*  But it's difficult not to think of it as a somewhat tragic situation fundamentally.
*  Because I don't think there's anything here that my read is the one that we've
*  been offering here after all, shouldn't cause them to panic.
*  You know, I think they might be checking with Washington is like, is this
*  read the appropriate one?
*  Is the read here that Washington is doubling down, committing as hard as it
*  possibly can to the Eurasian arena?
*  If I was on their side, I would, that would be the question I would be
*  insistently posing and I would imagine the Biden people would be reassuring
*  them on that school.
*  I want to ask then about how this reshapes also the economic world order.
*  And there's a paragraph from an economist piece that I've been thinking about a lot.
*  And I'm going to take a moment here and read it.
*  Quote, the longer term impact will be to accelerate the division of the
*  world into economic blocks.
*  Russia will be forced to tilt East, relying more on trade and financial
*  links with China in the West.
*  More politicians and firms will ask of a key tenant of globalization that you
*  should trade with everyone, not just your geopolitical allies is still valid,
*  not just for Russia, but other autocracies.
*  China will look at Western sanctions on Russia and conclude that it needs to
*  intensify its campaign of self-sufficiency.
*  The invasion of Ukraine might not cause a global economic crisis today, but it will
*  change how the world economy operates for decades to come.
*  What do you think of that?
*  I mean, broadly speaking, it seems like a plausible interpretation.
*  I would wonder perhaps about, as it were, the core, you know, attributing this to
*  Ukraine per se, I think Ukraine probably intensifies preexisting trends.
*  You know, the history here is interesting in the sense that the WTO rounds, the
*  Doha rounds, which was, as it were, the first to really embrace global development
*  collapsed between 2008 and 2009.
*  So that emerges in retrospect, I think is really quite a pivotal moment, because
*  since then it's become clear that that's really the direction that we're
*  traveling in anyway, right?
*  So all of the big trade deals of the recent, of the last decade or so have
*  been regional blocks of different types.
*  It gets interesting when you ask whether or not those regional blocks, which have
*  been the logic of trade policy, like NAFTA, like the EU in its extension, like
*  TPP as was, and now RCEP in Asia, do they align with geopolitical divisions?
*  And that, I think, is the more less obvious question to answer.
*  And all of the information coming out of Asia, as I understand it, that the Biden
*  administration is receiving is that none of America's significant security
*  strategy partners in Asia want an economic relationship with the United
*  States that is exclusive of China.
*  So in a sense, they want to mesh relationships like those which are now
*  proving so complex for the EU with Russia.
*  And they can't go any other way because the dynamic, you know, China is not Russia.
*  China has been the main driver of economic growth for the last two decades.
*  And we're not just talking any old economic growth, we're talking epic,
*  historically transformative, world historic shift.
*  Like, and America is saying, well, opt out of that or opt against it or position
*  yourself in a way which could be taken that way by Beijing, which is enough
*  right now to cause almost incredible problems.
*  And all of them say, no, even the Thailand's of this world and the states
*  which are most closely associated with the US in security policy terms, South
*  Korea, you know, so that I think is a really fundamental problem going forward
*  for American policy, because it can commit credibly on the security policy
*  side, but we know it is completely hamstrung, not to say paralyzed on trade
*  policy.
*  And it's so much so that I gather the American diplomats have very clear
*  marching instructions when they're in Asia, whenever trade comes up, market
*  deepening or market opening is not up for discussion.
*  Don't misunderstand what I'm saying to you, just so we're clear, because the top
*  the domestic politics of it are so toxic in the US.
*  So then you end up in a very lopsided world so that the economist vision rings
*  true up to a point, but it's not clear that the the blocks will line up in a way
*  that's terribly favorable to the US ultimately, I think in Asia in particular.
*  That seems right to me.
*  But the thing I would add that I find interesting in that vision and that to
*  your point feels to me like Ukraine crystallizing a preexisting trend is a
*  move towards supply chain self sufficiency.
*  I think COVID was a big part of this move as countries realize they didn't have
*  the mask capacity, the rapid testing production capacity, the vaccine
*  production capacity.
*  And then out of COVID, the economic disruptions, people want semiconductor
*  capacity.
*  They want you know, that's true for both America and China.
*  Currently, they both want to be independent on semiconductors.
*  It had felt to me already just watching what Congress was doing with the
*  Compete Act and the other versions of that bill, that they were trying to
*  develop an almost supply chain self sufficiency on the technologies they
*  understood to be critical.
*  I think now you look at what's happening with Russia and whatever decisions people
*  have to make today, because they're that dependent on them for energy or whatever
*  it might be.
*  They probably don't love making that decision.
*  For instance, I think that it is hard to imagine Germany signing the kind of
*  natural gas pipeline deal with Russia in the next 10 years that they signed and
*  now have frozen going backwards.
*  And so the idea that we may be moving towards a period of time where there is
*  much more national interest pressure on the supply chain, where the economic
*  logic of globalization and the national interest logic of self sufficiency
*  diverge and people stop pretending that they're or believing that they're
*  twinned.
*  That feels like a very big change that is, as you say, has multiple
*  contributors, but that Ukraine is really going to put a fine point on.
*  I think when we come to supply chains, the term itself is so anodyne and so
*  baggy and it encompasses everything from face masks to microchips.
*  And I don't mean that in a trivial sense, it's more complicated.
*  It just doesn't capture the existential significance of some rather than others.
*  And energy is one of them.
*  And I agree that the energy nexus between the West and its major suppliers
*  will be once again put in question.
*  And the answer, after all, is now very evident.
*  In other words, we need to do a renewable, we need to do an energy transition
*  anyway. And one hopes that that logic now takes on a really dramatic dynamic in
*  Europe. And that's where the logic of that energy transition has already
*  prevailed. Unfortunately, in the U.S., if you've been following Bloomberg or
*  something, the frackers have just been having a fantastic 48 hours.
*  Like, you know, it's all about unleashing the fossil fuel regime and we're
*  canceling Nord Stream and canceling Keystone.
*  This is crazy.
*  I mean, it's a really toxic alliance.
*  I think microchips are sui generis.
*  I really think they're in this special category, all of their own like oil and
*  gas. And because they are not just I mean, they are the future, right?
*  They are the it's not just iconic.
*  It's not a matter of symbolism.
*  They're literally the raw material out of which the new generations of
*  technology have to be made.
*  And the technologies required to do them in their current levels are so
*  extreme that America doesn't have a complete command of the whole set that
*  telling in and of its own in its own right.
*  America doesn't have the big fabs for the very latest chips.
*  And that is a historic product.
*  You know, there's a weird coincidence between, as it were, the liberal vision of
*  globalization and this breakthrough in technology, which meant that this
*  hugely strategic technology was inextricable, it seems, interwoven with an
*  East Asian post-Cold War myth, it turns out.
*  Right.
*  And untangling that is a hugely complex problem.
*  And what's really remarkable in the current moment is that it's what we've seen
*  is this unadulterated, straightforward, in-your-face hooking of the industrial
*  policy microchip logic to the national security logic.
*  And it started with began under Obama, but really took on an incredible momentum
*  in the Trump administration in 2019 and 2020.
*  And, you know, targeting Huawei was the beginning of that.
*  But, you know, the Biden administration right now, I believe, is weighing the
*  option of more intense sanctions on SMIC, China's designated microchip champion.
*  And that's where we're really going to see how serious this gets.
*  But I think it's sui generis, but absolutely crucially, completely right.
*  And the scale of spending globally on national industrial policies in Europe as
*  well, which is normally really drunk, the neoliberal Kool-Aid and does not do
*  that kind of thing, has been remarkable.
*  I mean, it's produced a huge row within European institutions about whether
*  they're really just going to toss out all of their competition regulations,
*  incredibly restrictive rules and state aid.
*  So yeah, it's a turning point.
*  Absolutely.
*  And, you know, that's fascinating because not only does it bust, as it were, the
*  general presumption that trade leads to peace, it kind of busts the general
*  presumption that trade is just trade.
*  You know, it turns out that trade in different things, you know, the
*  economic categories, the economic statistics convey a false sense of
*  hobo and drudnity.
*  Whereas what we're really dealing with are the sinews of power, like the
*  essentials, material ingredients of life and power.
*  And that's even more corrosive of economics in a sense, right?
*  Because then all our conventional calculus is just start going out the
*  window.
*  And that's part of the reason why this has become so unfettered because in
*  the name of microchips and sovereignty and independence, there's virtually no
*  amount of money you can't justify spending.
*  If we are entering what we feel to me to be entering, which is a renewed era of
*  great power conflict.
*  And whether or not you actually include Russia as one of the great powers is, I
*  think, interesting, but you could call a block with China as a great power.
*  One of the really scary things about that is that climate change and
*  decarbonization certainly strike me as things where you need very high levels
*  of international cooperation, or at least where it would be speeded along with
*  fairly high levels of international cooperation.
*  And I think a lot of the thinking has remained around pretty liquid energy
*  markets, pretty easy cross-border shipments.
*  The hotter conflict gets, the harder cooperation gets.
*  And so one of the first casualties it looks to me from more great power conflict
*  is less climate cooperation.
*  And in terms of the way, you know, I think we all immediately moved to, well,
*  what if we have a nuclear war?
*  And that's terrifying.
*  But also one of the ways it seems very, very worrying for humanity as a whole is
*  what if our already quite fragile levels of international operation on this
*  continue to deteriorate because it becomes issue seven on agenda where issues one to
*  four are more pressing to people?
*  That, I think, is the crucial issue.
*  I'm not sure I actually agree that right now the climate problem presents itself
*  preeminently as a problem of global cooperation.
*  There are certain aspects of the climate problem which do have that feature.
*  But if you take the climate problem as seriously as I think we have to at this
*  point, and as seriously as I think big parts of the leadership in China
*  increasingly are, it's a national interest issue.
*  You do it because you've got to do it.
*  And furthermore, they increasingly see it as a zone of, you know, industrial policy
*  competition. So you do it because you want to profit from the energy transition.
*  I understand that's a construction of this problem.
*  That is the construction.
*  I think it's an optimistic construction of the problem in some respects, because it
*  minimizes the amount of cooperation that's actually necessary.
*  There are certain domains within the climate space where cooperation, say,
*  notably around development, spending, development, investment and in certain key
*  technologies could be helpful.
*  But we could be in a space now where it gets productively incorporated into
*  competition between great powers in a way that will be novel.
*  We shouldn't rule that out as an option.
*  But I do absolutely agree, and it's been very striking that, as it were, since now
*  the climate problem is really a matter of urgency, we need to achieve major steps
*  this year. We need to reduce emissions by 7 percent in 2022.
*  And we are not focused on that problem right now.
*  We've got other things on our mind.
*  And furthermore, with this opening up and energy prices going berserk and this
*  question of sufficiency being posed, as it were, it opens the door for the creeping
*  influence of the rearguard action of fossil fuel.
*  It not just opens it, bursts it wide open and gives them the stage.
*  And even though their logics are all terrible and even though their arguments are
*  all bad and they should really be rejected, it becomes really difficult to fight them.
*  And furthermore, in these moments where the president of the United States, at a
*  moment of crisis, goes onto the rostrum and says, yes, American citizens, I
*  promise to defend your right to cheap gasoline at all costs, including sacrificing
*  this thing you might think is important.
*  That doesn't send a good signal either.
*  And the Biden administration has been caught in that cleft stick really since the
*  fall of last year when prices began to surge.
*  And there's a whole new space opening up for us right now of, as it were, as and
*  when we get serious about the climate adjustment, of how you maintain focus.
*  I mean, that in and of itself is going to be a hugely difficult issue.
*  How do you articulate other things around climate rather than treating climate as
*  number seven on the list of six other more important stuff?
*  And in that respect, this is devastating.
*  In a sense, COVID showed us another example where I think the logic worked the
*  other way around, where COVID in a sense supercharged an immediate crisis, you
*  know, mugged by reality kind of a crisis, in fact, drove the climate agenda in
*  interesting ways.
*  It'll be interesting to see how this plays out, but the politics of climate no
*  longer can be thought of a single issue.
*  They clearly have to be articulated with everything else.
*  Is they going to have any kind of chance of gaining the momentum that we need?
*  Which is, I think, fingers crossed is going to happen in Europe this next
*  coming year.
*  They go any other way.
*  They really have, you know, won't give up hope.
*  But there's no reason why you shouldn't read this crisis as a huge invitation to
*  just go big on renewables and flexible reserve capacity.
*  So here I'm jumping in to take a moment to say that was where we left part one on
*  Friday.
*  Then over the weekend, Adam emailed me and said the new sanctions were a
*  difference in kind, not just degree.
*  We were now seeing a financial war against Russia that was beyond what anyone
*  had expected and what anyone had forecast.
*  And so we spoke again on Monday morning to talk about what had changed and why
*  and what it meant.
*  So here's part two of our conversation.
*  Adam Tooze, welcome right back to the show.
*  Good to be here.
*  Okay.
*  So we taped the first part of this episode Friday.
*  That was meant to just be the episode.
*  It's now Monday.
*  What changed over the weekend?
*  Well, first and foremost, I think most people's expectations about how the war
*  was going to go and the heroic resistance being mounted by the Ukrainians and the
*  apparent incompetence and decisiveness of the Russian military have created this
*  extraordinary drama.
*  And into that then has come the escalation of financial sanctions from a kind of dim
*  outline of what was going to happen last week to by Saturday afternoon East Coast
*  time, this dramatic declaration by the Europeans and the Americans together of all
*  of the red lines crossing.
*  I mean, they blew the Overton window right open and I think did so very
*  deliberately. They said, Swift, the payment system, this notorious interbank
*  communication system is on the agenda.
*  We're going to cut strategic Russian banks out of that system.
*  And the central bank is not untouchable either.
*  And then as the days have gone on and as the escalation has ramped up with Putin's
*  nuclear threats by Sunday afternoon, we really have the concretization of this
*  with the Europeans and now this morning, the US Treasury basically making it clear
*  that they intend to freeze the assets of the Russian central bank.
*  And that now has come to dominate everything else because that has unleashed a full
*  on financial crisis in Russia on Monday as the markets opened or rather didn't open
*  because they couldn't open them safely.
*  So the ruble has collapsed and we're moving into a situation tantamount to
*  economic and financial warfare while the war is actually continuing.
*  So sanctions that I think were originally designed as ex post punitive of Russia's
*  behavior and abuse of international law are now becoming entangled with an actual
*  ongoing conflict in which we are essentially in the position, say, of Roosevelt
*  with the British in 1941.
*  And it's all measures short of war, essentially, including the delivery of lethal
*  weapons to an ongoing conflict.
*  When I look back on our conversation on Friday, we talked a fair amount about
*  Swift, which they're doing at least a partial cutting out of some of these
*  Russian banks from Swift.
*  We did not talk about central bank sanctions.
*  That was not understood to be on the agenda.
*  But then you emailed over the weekend when that began moving up and you said this
*  would this would change everything in the response here.
*  So why do the central bank sanctions matter so much?
*  What does it mean to sanction a central bank and how does it change the economic
*  situation Russia is now facing?
*  It totally changes the game, because one of the things it totally changes is the
*  status of those national foreign exchange reserves that we spoke about on
*  Friday and by any conventional metric are if you're talking about financial
*  crises or targeted sanctions of the type that Russia saw in the Ukraine over the
*  Ukraine and Crimea after 2014, they are your bulwark.
*  But that presumes that you can access them.
*  And if the other parties in the state system of the world are willing to go as
*  far as to declare your central bank, I'm not even sure whether to call it outlaw
*  so much as a criminal really to declare it as it were ineligible for any kind of
*  transactions, then those currency reserves that you've got are no longer
*  really accessible to you.
*  And now there's an absolutely explicit mandate on the part of the Europeans in
*  particular to stop any transactions.
*  And the Americans have declared it prohibited for any American national.
*  So at that point, the calculus tips and it for me exposes yet again, the way in
*  which this conflict is really ripping up the playbook, changing the parameters,
*  because it made perfect sense to describe them as a source of stability before we
*  went to this place, because they had been in 08 and 1415.
*  They manifestly were.
*  They were a way in which Russia could stabilize its exchange rate and just like
*  other emerging markets have, and they do it certainly not assuming that the world
*  is as it were friendly to them.
*  They are supposed to be defensive potentially even against various degrees
*  of aggression.
*  But what the current moment exposes is that in an all out war situation,
*  essentially this property of the state becomes forfeit in so far as it remains
*  within the control.
*  So Russia moves to the position of an Iran or an Afghanistan.
*  After all, Afghanistan's exchange reserves have been impounded and half of
*  them are going to be apparently given over to providing compensation to 9-11
*  victims.
*  So that's the kind of terrain that we could be in here.
*  This has never ever happened on this scale.
*  I mean, the minimum estimate of how many reserves are within the Western orbit is
*  in the order of $300 billion.
*  So this is serious money with serious ramifications for the Russian financial
*  system.
*  Concretely, what it immediately means is they don't have any firepower to
*  stabilize their currency with.
*  So they've been doing things like drafting the foreign exchange earnings of
*  private corporations in Russia and banning foreign companies like BP that
*  suddenly wants to sell its stake in Rosneft from doing so.
*  So they're freezing Western money in Russia and if you like drafting the foreign
*  exchange reserves of Russian businesses.
*  So this really is a foreign exchange regime.
*  It's the sort of thing you do in extremists or under wall circumstances.
*  If this is such a potent weapon, why was this not discussed, threatened, shown
*  beforehand?
*  Why was this not used as a deterrent possibility so Russia knew this would come?
*  Why was it not imposed right after they invaded Ukraine?
*  Why does this begin coming up Sunday, Monday after they invade as opposed to weeks
*  before so it can be in their calculus or immediately so it's part of the
*  punishment?
*  I think this is a good question.
*  I asked myself that question because it should have been obvious that this could
*  be a move that they make.
*  But it simply wasn't.
*  I mean, no one was discussing this as an option seriously.
*  And I hate to use the analogy because it's become explosive is that this is the
*  nuclear option.
*  So you don't go there.
*  Like it's the question you don't pose.
*  It's the bad thought that everyone might be having somewhere buried deep down.
*  But it's a hugely dangerous thought.
*  And you can see this in the analogies, right?
*  Because out there in the world, all of a sudden, when this came on the radar,
*  people started saying it's the Iran option.
*  But the problem with that analogy is that it's far too close for comfort, right?
*  Because the Iran sanctions are obviously targeted around to prevent it from getting
*  nuclear weapons.
*  But we are now applying Iran style treatment to not just a nuclear power, the number two
*  nuclear power in the world, the old Cold War antagonist in the middle of an active
*  shooting war in which we are taking sides, in which they are not making the progress
*  they expect.
*  So we and we are threatening by this means to deliver a devastating blow to their home
*  front.
*  I mean, you know, panic in the streets, total disruption of the ordinary lives of tens of
*  millions of Russians.
*  So it's a huge step.
*  That's, I think, why if we had it had it in our conscious minds, there would have been
*  a no-no about talking about it.
*  But the honest truth is it just wasn't on people's radar because we hadn't placed Russia
*  in the Iran, Venezuela, North Korea box.
*  One oddity of all of it is that energy is still exempted from everything we're talking
*  about.
*  Energy is exempted from the swift cutoff.
*  Energy is exempted, as I understand it, from the central bank sanctions.
*  Energy, as we discussed on Friday, is the big Russian export where they get a lot of
*  their money.
*  They could presumably do some amount of currency stabilization hidden in their energy
*  flows.
*  It is strange to hear people talk about this as the nuclear option and meanwhile have Russia
*  begin to talk about literal nuclear options.
*  And in the background, everybody's saying, but of course, we're still going to do a lot
*  of trade in liquid natural gas.
*  Literally today, the gas pipelines are fully full, apparently.
*  Today, they're fully absolutely gas from the Ukrainian pipeline or thought to report their
*  full capacity.
*  Nord Stream 1, as far as I know, is also fully operative.
*  It's happening right now and money is flowing the other way.
*  By hook or by crook, what people are reporting is that there's difficulty transaction in some
*  of those financial firms are much less willing to get involved with those deals.
*  But it is extraordinary.
*  So to that extent, but this was also, it's horrible to stick with this analogy, but it's
*  kind of like a tactical use of nuclear weapons or medium range missiles rather than a full on
*  US Soviet exchange world ending.
*  Though it may feel pretty apocalyptic to people in Russia right now.
*  They have a hardened fiscal military apparatus in Russia.
*  They will be fine.
*  They will find ways to cope.
*  But it's very dramatic.
*  I mean, the energy is going on because the biggest revenue flow for Russia is all about oil.
*  And the Biden administration has flat out said, again, it doubled down on this on Friday
*  last week, that it was not going to touch the oil markets.
*  Whether they can really stick to that, the press secretary, I think in conversations
*  in the last 24 hours has begun to pull back from that.
*  And I think the Europeans are now concertedly looking for alternatives,
*  mapping out the options.
*  Everyone realizes now this is going to be a more prolonged confrontation than anyone imagined.
*  The shift in German opinion has been staggering and clearly is reciprocal.
*  In other words, the liberals, the more right wing members of the coalition government
*  have declared renewable energy as freedom energy.
*  It's kind of an ironic echo of the famous freedom molecules quote about American gas.
*  And on the other hand, demonstratively,
*  Green economics minister Harbeck has gone on television to say that they're seriously
*  weighing up the possibility of extending the lives of the nuclear reactors, though
*  everything seems to suggest it's not actually a viable option and won't make much difference
*  in the critical period.
*  But these are solidaristic moves on both sides to show that everyone is rethinking their
*  parameters.
*  Meanwhile, Schultz has gone to the Bundestag and asked for a staggering increase in German
*  military expenditure.
*  So there is a huge rearrangement going on.
*  I want to hold on that piece for a minute because it seems profound to me.
*  When you look at how this entire conflict was being framed, even just a couple of days ago,
*  Russia is considering invading Ukraine and the West is going to treat this as an economic war.
*  They're not going to get involved in a shooting war in Ukraine.
*  They're not doing that much to they were doing a little bit to give Ukraine defensive
*  capabilities, but not at any level that people thought would really make a difference.
*  And now that feels like it is changing.
*  The EU announced 500 million in direct military aid to Ukraine.
*  That's the first time the EU is giving direct provision of weaponry to a country under attack.
*  Germany is proposing this 110 billion dollar investment in their military.
*  That is almost twice the country's entire defense budget last year.
*  That is wild.
*  This is being talked about as a watershed moment in Europe's defense posture.
*  It is moving from an economic war to something that is being treated as a new paradigm for the
*  EU's capability to get into and defend itself in shooting wars.
*  How do you understand those changes?
*  Is that overstating them or is this something really new?
*  Small as it is, the 500 million directly from the EU for weapons is really,
*  that's as it were, a big taboo break.
*  Sweden?
*  Mutual Sweden delivering lethal weapons?
*  I mean, it's staggering stuff and it's very, I think, on the one hand dramatic and I'm,
*  you know, die in the world to my dying death EU adherent.
*  And at that level, you know, you celebrate these kind of moves as the way in which Europe
*  makes itself through crisis and the steps are in the right direction.
*  And the promise from Germany is not, you know, it's overdue.
*  I mean, as a historian amongst other things, German military history is staggering to have
*  the chief of the German army declaring his embarrassment on LinkedIn, you know,
*  with his inability to react.
*  These are amazing moments.
*  But the alarming thing about this is, as it were, the shift, which is exactly as you said,
*  from a position which was really ex post.
*  In other words, the invasion of Ukraine was not thought in itself to be historically meaningful
*  because it was going to be so swift and it was going to be annihilatory.
*  And then the embarrassment of Ukrainian politics and Ukrainian sovereignty would go away
*  and we could move on to a position where the heroism of the Ukrainians has made that impossible.
*  And so we're now in these incredibly fraught exchanges between Zelensky,
*  who is, you know, acting out of his skin and, you know, really demonstrating an extraordinary
*  capacity to do, you know, the Jupiterian thing, essentially, for real, you know,
*  under the threat of combat.
*  And he's basically pointing the finger at the EU and saying, here is the question,
*  will you have us or not?
*  And that is extraordinary, right?
*  Because if one of Russia's red lines is NATO, the other Russian red line spoken or unspoken
*  is Ukrainian EU membership, because that's in some sense, this is a more profound challenge to
*  Russia's own model and its control over Eastern Europe and its Germany.
*  So, and that this is being opened up in the midst of combat, right, in the midst of an
*  existential struggle where we may see these people killed more or less live on television
*  as they refuse to surrender and give.
*  And it has roused European public opinion to an astonishing extent,
*  giant demonstrations in Berlin.
*  So it's a very dynamic, I mean, I spend a lot of time thinking about Klausovitz,
*  and this is like, you know, this is the Klausovitzian triangle of battlefield, military,
*  grand diplomacy and popular platoon acting out in an extraordinarily dynamic way before our eyes,
*  with very, I think, unpredictable consequences and with huge potential for disaster from the
*  part of the Ukrainians.
*  Well, this to me is so important to understanding.
*  The reason I wanted to do the show this way, adding this on is because
*  I think it's important to watch the equilibrium here change, right?
*  You're watching war change the underlying structure of the conflict in real time.
*  You mentioned Zelensky.
*  I don't think I've ever seen a more remarkable performance of a wartime leader,
*  certainly in my lifetime.
*  What he is doing in a completely new media environment, I mean, it has built what he is
*  doing in many ways for social media.
*  It is extraordinary.
*  And if you go back even a couple of days and think about that triangle,
*  I think that there was a calculation, a solving for the equilibrium where people were looking at
*  Russia's military or presumed military superiority over Ukraine.
*  Then we were looking at the economic consequences both for Russia and for the West on various
*  levels of sanctions.
*  And we were solving for what looked like a stable output there.
*  And into the middle of that comes Zelensky and this remarkably fierce and effective, actually,
*  Ukrainian resistance.
*  And social media, right?
*  It blasts it into everybody's home.
*  You're watching this happen in real time.
*  Zelensky is calling in with other ministers and saying, this may be the last time you
*  hear me alive.
*  Tell me a bit about how that changes the situation, because on some level, the
*  calculations around sanctions were calculations of domestic public opinion.
*  There were calculations about what level of disruption European and American and UK citizens
*  would absorb for Ukraine, which in theory they didn't care that much about.
*  But then it happens.
*  Then this immediacy of Zelensky, the images emerges and the amount of caring, the passion
*  on the part of a lot of these publics and even a lot of the elites in these governments
*  changes and the sanctions begin to change and the conflict begins to change.
*  So as a story, can you talk a bit about the passion dimension of this?
*  Because that's what people were not predicting well.
*  Well, the two things, right?
*  Exactly as you say, the interaction between the dogged, ferocious, apparently successful
*  resistance.
*  I think we have to reserve judgment on the battlefield.
*  I'm convinced that this is not done yet in two different dimensions.
*  A, the siege of Kiev and the big cities, on the other hand, which could be apocalyptic
*  and Syrian-like.
*  And on the other hand, the pincer that is closing from the south that may, in a sense,
*  destroy Ukraine's ability to resist in the Donbass and will deliver to Russia one of
*  their strategic goals, which is to secure the full territory of the Donbass.
*  But nevertheless, this week in which the Ukrainian resistance has held up has changed
*  the game exactly as you describe it.
*  And another hugely significant thing is that Zelensky is not, as it were, just mobilizing
*  his own population and the Ukrainian resistance is not just mobilizing, but he is then posing
*  the geo-economic geopolitical question and saying, and I want to talk about EU membership
*  from the middle of this.
*  Like it's as though from the middle of the Battle of Britain, Keynes and Churchill had
*  said, we want to do Bretton Woods now.
*  Can we talk about Bretton Woods?
*  We want to talk about the future currency union because we're going down in flames and
*  we're going to dare you to tell us that, you know, dollar's going to rule here.
*  I mean, it's that kind of a, it's an extraordinary power play, hugely high stakes.
*  And I think it reflects the fact that he knows perfectly well that under any other circumstances,
*  the answer is no, nor do we want to talk about, we've told you this before.
*  We don't want to talk about this.
*  One thing about the way Zelensky has not just mobilized opinion, but mobilized the values of
*  the EU in this moment.
*  We were talking the other day about the way that Putin perhaps understood the dark side
*  of the globalizing vision, that he understood that economic interdependence and growth maybe
*  don't create harmony.
*  Maybe it creates leverage for conflict.
*  Maybe he can do more because it actually will hurt Europe.
*  It will hurt America more to cut Russia off.
*  At the same time, Zelensky is showing that he understands the bright side of it, the value
*  side of it.
*  He is using this war and saying, well, you promised all of this.
*  You said that if, you know, we were democratic, that if we defended ourselves, that if we were
*  a country, if you are a country worthy of the international order, the international order
*  will be there for you.
*  And so one thing that really feels like it is changing is that Putin's cynicism is all
*  of a sudden being matched by Zelensky's call to international optimism.
*  And I'm not, I want to be very careful.
*  I'm not saying that is going to be enough for Ukraine to repel Russia, but it has really
*  changed, it seems to me, the calculus for a lot of Western leaders because, you know,
*  they kind of switched into rail politic mode with Putin and they expected it again, looked
*  to me, that everybody would follow them there.
*  Then when Zelensky and the Ukrainians didn't follow, it transformed.
*  And so maybe we underestimated, or maybe the power of this was underestimated going in.
*  Like he seems to have understood that there was more leverage here than the West actually
*  thought or planned for.
*  I mean, how much premeditation there is here, I simply don't know.
*  And I think it's going to be just, I mean, to speak about it in these terms sounds academic
*  and cold blooded.
*  And, you know, it's going to be fascinating to see what the EU does with this because
*  sure, clearly the Ukrainians are demonstrating their resilient refusal to support, to be
*  subordinated by the force of Russian arms, you know, and it's extraordinary to see.
*  And they are clearly willing to sacrifice their lives, their families.
*  One is just humbled by it.
*  But at what point is the EU going to say something along the lines of, but we also need
*  to know that you're really down with the rule of law because this patriotic rally is not the
*  same thing as the rule of law.
*  This is a patriotic rally that is absolutely bona fide.
*  We've not seen any of the likes of this in Europe, you know, maybe since Prague, 68 or
*  Solidarnosc in the 1980s.
*  Those are the examples.
*  But that's not the same thing as what we're asking for or have asked for and asked of
*  you and you, Ukraine, have failed to show even any signs of being able to move in that
*  direction.
*  That has been the European position all along, right?
*  So it's going to be an extraordinarily, almost impossible problem, I think, for the European
*  political class to resolve this issue.
*  I find it hard to imagine at this point that they're not going to put Ukraine on some sort
*  of long-term accession track.
*  Maybe they can sidestep what von der Leyen apparently already said.
*  Poland is arguing vociferously for them to be given this status.
*  There are ways of fudging that.
*  After all, they put Turkey on an accession track in the early 2000s.
*  And that's a non-trivial part of the entire story of Erdogan's frustration, dissolution
*  with the West and so on, because he was supposed to be the driver of that project.
*  And in the end, it came to nothing.
*  So there are ways in which they might be able to, as it were, fudge this or postpone the
*  decision.
*  But it has absolutely changed the game, because the thing that made everyone's positions cohere
*  was that, as it were, the weakness of Ukrainian nation statehood and nationalism would fold
*  in front of the force of Russian arms.
*  And then the problem could be handled as an ex-post problem of punishing Russia and not
*  as a problem of dealing with a vibrant, vigorous Ukrainian sovereignty.
*  BD S2 – Last time we spoke a lot about the way China would interpret the situation.
*  Do you think that has changed since Friday?
*  If you're trying to looking at this, you're thinking a little bit about Taiwan.
*  What have you learned in the past four or five days?
*  PYM – I think it's very, very early days.
*  And that story is unfolding too.
*  I think structurally, they're coupled together in ways.
*  Over the weekend, I was trying to make sense of this question and started digging back.
*  And when you do that, what you discover is that this alignment of Russia and China against
*  a unipolar American order, of course, is not new.
*  And it's not a matter of Xi and Putin.
*  It goes back to the 1990s.
*  It was already in view.
*  In a sense, what happened to them is that in 1997, they made this joint declaration
*  on a multipolar world, which they were going to support.
*  And at that point, perhaps it seemed plausible or at least something they could assert.
*  And then basically, Kosovo, the late 90s interventions of NATO in the former Yugoslavia,
*  and then 9-11, and then, of course, the wars of choice of the 2000s intervened.
*  And that, I think, that phase between 1997 and 2007 becomes more and more
*  obvious in its significance.
*  But what that means is to agree this is hardwired.
*  There's no way back.
*  But they must, on the other hand, be thinking quite hard about what they've let themselves
*  in for here.
*  Matt Klein put it to me the other day, kind of usefully in the sense that,
*  is Russia actually North Korea?
*  In other words, an ally you can't really disown, but on the other hand,
*  also one that's really quite difficult and dangerous potentially.
*  And it's easy, I think, to say, well, the Russians are going to be desperately
*  dependent on the Chinese, which I think is true if these sanctions really begin to bite,
*  because they will be able to transact with the Chinese in Renminbi.
*  And that will help.
*  But on the other hand, the Chinese must also be feeling that they have attached themselves
*  to a kind of rogue elephant of militarism and blundering, frankly.
*  And again, I think if the Chinese had seen what most of us expected, which is a short,
*  sharp shot and a rapid overtake of the Ukraine by Russia, that would have been one thing.
*  But I don't think they thought they were letting themselves in for this mess and this PR disaster
*  and this debacle in some senses so far.
*  But maybe by the end of the week, this will look really different.
*  Let me end on this.
*  We know that the Russian people are hearing about this war differently than we are.
*  We know that Russian state media, which controls the media there,
*  is on a very, very tight leash with what they're reporting.
*  So Russia is not on Twitter following the war that a lot of us are following at the moment.
*  What they are feeling is the impact of these sanctions.
*  And that is the place where the reality of this war, whatever the narrative that is attached to it
*  is, is going to come for them.
*  What do these sanctions at this point mean for them?
*  What do you think it is going to be like to be an ordinary Russian citizen
*  for whom things were pretty normal two weeks ago?
*  What is it going to be like to be them over the next week's months?
*  Yeah, this is the parallel that scared me, Witless, at the weekend.
*  So if we recognize that the battlefield has become, as it were, the generator of a huge
*  contingency, huge, unpredictable contingency that we didn't reckon with that's overturned
*  all our prior expectations, what with these sanctions, which are now massive, we've decided
*  to do is to unleash another incredibly unpredictable dynamic force into this equation, which,
*  as of Sunday morning, includes nuclear threats.
*  And it's playing out day by day, hour by hour now, and it will affect the vast majority of
*  Russians in one way or another.
*  I'm not a sufficiently expert in Russian public opinion.
*  They were not prepared for this.
*  Sam Green at the King's College London made a very good comment about this, that, you know,
*  he didn't know whether he should be calmed by the fact that the Russian public was not panicking
*  or alarmed that they weren't, because if they weren't panicking ahead of what was about to
*  hit them, that meant they were truly naive.
*  And this was going to come as a huge shock, and that would make their reaction even more
*  unpredictable.
*  What we haven't seen so far is crowds in the streets celebrating the great victories of our
*  dear leader.
*  That hasn't happened.
*  We have seen the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church come out and announce the
*  opponents of Russia and Ukraine, which is horrendous, a huge failure of spiritual
*  leadership when we've seen the Pope doing kind of the reverse.
*  But I think this is a worrying further element in this whole drama, and one that we unleashed,
*  as it were, on the premise that this would be a done deal, grim as that was, into a situation
*  that is so much more dynamic than that.
*  Again, a bunch of really interesting economic analysis coming up around this question as it
*  happens shows really that there is serious reason to worry about lower middle class Russian
*  households.
*  They've been squeezed hard over the last five, six, seven years.
*  Their incomes have not been going up.
*  They've been piling up debt.
*  One of the first things that happened today is the interest rates went to 20%.
*  So that's going to immediately bite into your income.
*  So there is a serious risk here of major economic and social fallout.
*  The regime has ways of responding to this, but if Iran is anything to go by as a model,
*  which is the only country remotely similar to which these kind of sanctions have been applied,
*  you would expect this to be a bit of a slow burn.
*  So you would expect the pain to build up over time and the political consequences to follow
*  potentially.
*  So right now, I think the main thing to emphasize is just the sheer unpredictability of the shock
*  that we've delivered and the consequences it will have.
*  AC Let's end there.
*  Always our final question.
*  What are three books you would recommend to the audience?
*  G So I would recommend by Nick Mulder, Yale University Press, The Economic Weapon, which is a
*  fascinating pathbreaking history of sanctions and couldn't really be more urgent in the
*  current moment.
*  It's a brilliant history of the early history of sanctions.
*  As my second book, I would recommend a really fun, polemical read by a combo of authors.
*  The End of the End of History, Politics in the 21st Century by Alex Hockley, George Hoare,
*  and Philip Cunliffe.
*  And my third is a book I stumbled on when I was trying to make sense of the whole crypto
*  craze, boom bust thing that we've been going through.
*  And I found it extraordinarily helpful in understanding the technical issues in the
*  background.
*  And it is Eswar Espresad's The Future of Money on the Digital Future of Money in the World.
*  A really great book if you need a guide to understanding a little bit about the crypto
*  in crypto.
*  AC Adam Tewes, it's always unbelievably clarifying to talk to you.
