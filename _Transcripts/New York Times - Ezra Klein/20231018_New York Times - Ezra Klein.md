# Israel Is Giving Hamas What It Wants
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWkgaZO24xA)
*  The
*  first thing that my mother asked me when she saw me after Hamas's massacre in Israel was
*  to promise that I wouldn't write or talk about it publicly, that I wouldn't make myself a
*  target for some violent anti-Semite.
*  I had that conversation with her just a day or two after talking to my friends about whether
*  or not they were going to keep their children home that week because their kids go to daycare
*  at a synagogue and they're worried that daycare would be bombed or that an armed shooter would
*  open fire.
*  That should give you a sense of what it's felt like to be Jewish in recent weeks.
*  Israel's 9-11.
*  That's been the refrain.
*  And I fear that analogy carries more truth than the people making it wanted to.
*  Because what was 9-11?
*  It's an attack that drowned an entire country, our country, my country, America, in terror
*  and in rage.
*  It drove us mad with fear.
*  And in response, we shredded our own liberties.
*  We invaded Afghanistan.
*  We invaded Iraq.
*  Our response to 9-11 led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people.
*  It made us weaker.
*  It made us poorer.
*  It made us hated around the world.
*  We didn't pull our forces out of Afghanistan until 2021, 20 years later.
*  And when we left, we did so in humiliation and catastrophe and defeat, abandoning the
*  country to the Taliban.
*  Our politics still haven't recovered from the ravages of that era.
*  It was in large part the invasion of Iraq that discredited the Republican Party's
*  leadership class, leading directly to the rise of Donald Trump.
*  9-11 created a permission structure in American politics to do incredibly stupid,
*  brutal things.
*  And we are still paying the costs.
*  Perhaps we always will be.
*  In the days after Hamas's attack, I was in Tokyo, of all places.
*  I was far from the people I would gather with to grieve and to process and to hurt.
*  So I was confined to following along online, which I don't recommend.
*  And what was so striking was to see how fast we were turning on each other, how we
*  became obsessed not with what should actually be done or even what was actually being
*  done, but with what was and could be said and by whom.
*  I read and heard more about the idiocy of student groups and random academics than
*  about what the right response here actually was.
*  And it's tempting to call that a distraction or a waste of time or a derangement
*  driven by social media.
*  But it's not.
*  This too was an echo of what happened in America after 9-11, that era of flag pins
*  and freedom fries.
*  Council culture is endlessly debated today, but the boundaries of speech and the
*  penalties for stepping over them were stronger then.
*  And there's a purpose to that.
*  There always is.
*  What can and cannot be said shapes what can and cannot be done.
*  So it's worth listening to what the people in power are saying right now.
*  Yav Golan, Israel's defense minister said, we are fighting human animals and
*  are acting accordingly.
*  Israeli major General Ghassan Alian warned, there will be no electricity and no
*  water.
*  There will only be destruction.
*  You wanted hell, you will get hell.
*  Senator Lindsey Graham said that Israel should, quote, level the place.
*  And of the civilian death toll that could bring, he said, every death going
*  forward, I blame on Hamas, not Israel.
*  Biden's State Department released a memo to its diplomats warning them not to use
*  phrases like an end to violence or bloodshed, not to call for a ceasefire or
*  even for calm.
*  And I was so struck by this exchange between a reporter from Real Clear Politics
*  and Joe Biden's press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre.
*  Some members of Congress who have called for a ceasefire and they have not gone
*  as far as backing the administration's call for support for Israel.
*  So look, I've seen some of those statements this weekend and we're going
*  to continue to be very clear.
*  We believe they're wrong.
*  We believe they're repugnant and we believe they're disgraceful.
*  Our condemnation belongs squarely with terrorists who have brutally murdered,
*  raped, kidnapped hundreds, hundreds of Israelis.
*  There can be no equivocation about that.
*  There are not two sides here.
*  There are not two sides.
*  Notice the change there right at the end from where our condemnation belongs to
*  whether there are two sides in this.
*  I would say there are so many more than two sides.
*  Israel is itself a fractious and divided country.
*  There are countless Palestinians who loathe Hamas.
*  But the point being made here is just the opposite, that there is only one side,
*  at least right now.
*  But hundreds of thousands of Gazan residents are being driven from their homes
*  at pain of death in an Israeli airstrike.
*  They know and we know they may have only rubble to return to.
*  They know and we know that that is part of the point of this policy.
*  When the Biden administration says there are not two sides here in that framework,
*  which side are these people fleeing their homes on?
*  And more to the point, who is on their side?
*  In a way, it was almost inevitable, fitting, that George W.
*  Bush himself would reemerge to apply the logic of 9-11 to the moment.
*  This from a video posted by Axios.
*  My thoughts were that we need to support Israel.
*  No ands, ifs or buts.
*  This is an unprovoked attack by terrorist people willing to kill innocent people to
*  achieve an objective.
*  Hamas is a political organization.
*  They do not reflect the majority of the Palestinians.
*  And don't be surprised if Israel takes whatever action is necessary to defend herself.
*  And it's going to be ugly for a while.
*  If you follow Bush's reasoning closely there, it's a remarkably telling statement.
*  Hamas does not reflect the majority of Palestinians, but Israel's reprisal needs
*  to be supported without any ands or ifs or buts, ugly as it may be, implicitly,
*  whatever it may be.
*  What was so repulsive to me in some leftist commentary after Hamas' massacre of
*  Israelis was a belief in collective guilt and collective punishment.
*  There was no debate over whether Hamas targeted and slaughtered civilians.
*  No.
*  The argument was that there was no such thing as an Israeli civilian.
*  No such thing as being an innocent in Israel.
*  It's repugnant.
*  But does repugnance of that logic not go both ways?
*  Is there no such thing as a civilian in Gaza?
*  And put aside the morality of the collective punishment being meted out on Gaza.
*  What of its wisdom?
*  Will this reduce support for Hamas or something yet worse than Hamas?
*  If so, then why did Hamas want to goad Israel into it, into raising and possibly
*  reoccupying Gaza?
*  They were not unclear that launching a massive attack capped by a pogrom they
*  spread videos of and then taking hostages.
*  They were not unclear about whether or not that would elicit an overwhelming
*  Israeli response.
*  What Hossein Abish wrote in the Atlantic Reads is obviously true to me.
*  Quote, Iran and Hamas are counting on Israel to attack Gaza with such ferocity.
*  The international sympathy of the past week toward Israel, even in the Arab world,
*  evaporates quickly and is replaced by outrage at the suffering inflicted on the
*  two million residents of Gaza.
*  End quote.
*  Why might Hamas want this?
*  Why would we not want to at least loudly ask that question?
*  How do we make sure they do not get what they want?
*  And what does or should Israel want beside vengeance?
*  And I want to be clear about this.
*  I think vengeance is a legitimate and even necessary goal here.
*  It cannot be safe.
*  It cannot be safe to murder Israeli civilians, but vengeance cannot be the
*  only goal.
*  Israelis, no less than Palestinians deserve peace and security.
*  Those need to be considerations too.
*  And that requires considering things.
*  I've been thinking lately about something that Spencer Ackerman, author of the
*  book Reign of Terror, which is I think the best book by far on how 9-11 deranged
*  America, something that he said, which is that the essence of the politics of
*  9-11 was quote, to make scandalous the presentation of context, to make
*  scandalous the presentation of context.
*  There's a deep truth to that.
*  To add context is in this kind of regime of thought to undermine the purity of
*  condemnation, to add sides.
*  That's an absurd way to think.
*  The brutal facts of the occupation, the architecture of control and humiliation
*  and checkpoints and work permits and blockades that Palestinians live under.
*  It does not justify Hamas's murders, but it helps explain Hamas's strength.
*  It's persistent appeal to at least some of the Palestinian people.
*  Hamas is built on Palestinian despair.
*  And if you radically increase Palestinian fury and despair, if you create a new
*  wave, a new generation of fathers who lost their sons and brothers who lost their
*  sisters and people now dedicated to revenge, have you actually made Israel safer?
*  Or have you made Hamas or something like it stronger?
*  Hardliners feed on each other.
*  Hamas's political strength has been an excellent excuse for Netanyahu's
*  government to abandon even the pretense of a real peace process.
*  If Hamas is on the other side of the table, then there can be no peace process
*  because there is no partner for peace.
*  Israel is right that it cannot make peace with Hamas, that Hamas's actual
*  aim is Israel's eradication.
*  That helped justify the path Israel's chosen in recent years.
*  A policy that tried to achieve safety through subjugation, this vast architecture
*  of walls and missile defense systems and intelligence operations and checkpoints
*  and imprisonments, the promise of all this was not justice.
*  It was security.
*  Itamar Ben-Ghavir, Israel's minister of national security, once said, quote,
*  my right, my wife's, my children's to roam the roads of Judea and Samaria are
*  more important than the right of movement of the Arabs.
*  That was the point of all this.
*  Security and freedom for Israelis.
*  And now this policy failed in the most horrible of ways.
*  Netanyahu failed, Ben-Ghavir failed.
*  There was a body count and we're being asked to trust that a government still
*  led by Netanyahu will respond appropriately and wisely to not under any circumstances
*  question the decisions they make.
*  Hamas and its backers in Iran want this war.
*  They fear the normalization of Israel's relations with the rest of the Middle East.
*  The misery of the Gazans is and always has been their strength.
*  If they're the only one seen as trying to change a status quo that is unrelentingly
*  hellish for those living inside it, then they stand alone as the champions of those
*  who feel no hope.
*  We've spent decades testing the proposition of whether inflicting more punishment on
*  the Palestinians will strengthen the moderates or the extremists in their midst.
*  The answer is known.
*  It is folly to forget it now.
*  There are two immovable facts here.
*  The daily oppression that Palestinians live under and the daily threat that
*  Israelis live amidst.
*  I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I know what Israel should do or how the
*  deep structure of this conflict can be solved.
*  I'm not among those who think there is some simple set of concessions or even at this
*  point, an imaginable deal that could or would lead to lasting peace.
*  Not now.
*  There's an old joke, though not very funny, about a tourist who asked for directions to
*  Dublin only to be told, well, if I were you, I wouldn't start from here.
*  But here is where we are.
*  And we shouldn't be fooled by the fact that we're not the only ones who are
*  fooled into believing that we cannot find ourselves somewhere much worse.
*  If you loathe Hamas and you should loathe Hamas, you should assume that the place
*  we're trying to lead us is not where we should be trying to go.
*  If you don't think Netanyahu's rule has made Israel safer or more united or closer
*  to a resolution of the fundamental threats that face it, and it hasn't, you
*  should not yourself be cowed into trusting his instincts in this moment.
*  That's a lesson Americans learned or should have learned from 9-11, the one we
*  have to pass on now.
*  Terrorists want you to act in a haze of fury and fear.
*  The only antidote is to open yourself to criticism and second guessing.
*  If you don't, you find yourself doing exactly what they wanted you to do.
*  And you can do terrible damage to yourself and terrible damage to the world, damage
*  they could have never inflicted on their own.
*  I was reading an essay by Ariel Angel, the editor in chief of the journal Jewish
*  Currents, and she was reflecting on the story of the Exodus from Egypt, the
*  slaying of the firstborn, children and adults and elderly.
*  And she writes, quote, it seems that hiding in our liberation myth is a
*  recognition that violence will visit the oppressed society indiscriminately.
*  But there's something else lurking in that story too.
*  Something that has upset me since I first read it in Hebrew school as a child.
*  After some of the early plagues, the Pharaoh agrees to let the Israelites go.
*  But then he quote, hardens his heart and keeps him captive.
*  But later, later as the plagues worsen, it is sometimes God who steps in and
*  hearted the Pharaoh's heart after he agrees to let the Israelites go.
*  After the plague of Locus, it reads, quote, the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart
*  and he would not let the Israelites go.
*  This happens repeatedly after the darkness, but the Lord hardened Pharaoh's
*  heart and he was not willing to let them go.
*  I will not attempt any amateur theology here.
*  There are many interpretations of these passages.
*  I haven't found one that really resolves a problem for me.
*  But what I will say is it, that story is also a parable of the relentless
*  destructive escalation that comes when our hearts harden, when fury makes it
*  impossible for us to find a way out.
*  What could have ended with darkness or Locusts or frogs instead ends in mass death.
*  I have for years felt nothing but despair when I stare into the abyss of this conflict.
*  There is no country in the world that would not hunt Hamas' leaders to the
*  ends of the earth right now if their savagery had been visited upon them.
*  And that is to say nothing of the hostages Hamas is still holding captive.
*  But the idea that you will destroy Hamas this way?
*  I doubt it.
*  Particularly if this becomes not just a generational trauma for ordinary
*  Israelis, but also for Gazans with thousands dead and who knows how many
*  maimed and homeless and displaced.
*  When I was young, the first trip I ever took anywhere without my parents was to
*  Israel, my grandparents took me and they were so proud.
*  They were the Holocaust generation.
*  It was a defining fact of their lives and Israel's security, its existence
*  meant everything to them because they felt it could one day mean everything for us.
*  And I want for Israel what they wanted, what they saw in it, safety, a haven.
*  And I want that for Palestinians too.
*  And one thing I believe is that there's no chance of it until power is held by
*  different forces on both sides.
*  So that's one question that's going to animate the conversations I'm working on
*  now that will release soon.
*  How do those who want something different than this, something closer to
*  peace, become strong enough to matter again?
*  The hardliners make each other stronger.
*  Is it possible for the peacemakers to do the same?
